"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later. But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do. Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact... Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor. That's called business, by the way. I did not. I did not. I do not say that. I do not say that. She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. So I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone. And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions. I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. Yeah, for 30 years. Well, he approved NAFTA... He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... You haven't done it. You haven't done it. Excuse me. Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. You called it the gold standard. You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. Not. So is it President Obama's fault? Is it President Obama's fault? Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? Because he's pushing it. But you have no plan. Secretary, you have no plan. That's about all you've... You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story. Facts. And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see. Well, could I just finish -- I think I... I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website. She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion. And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job. I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand. And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad. So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back. Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. And here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. But we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton. Why not? There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country. Yes. Then you didn't read it. Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name? How much? How much for my family? Lester, how much? Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on. Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton. I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals? We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals. Excuse me. Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. And in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't. I will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. I will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, ""Don't do it."" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails. It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000... That makes me smart. That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also. As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had. The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that. But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. I am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country. So the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas. It would be squandered, too, believe me. Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work... Which our country should do, too. Wrong. Wrong. So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do. But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. But we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing. We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country. Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country. I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it. We have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated. No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed. No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. You need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good. But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things. But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. Ugh. I'd like to respond to that. First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? But we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. No, you're wrong. You're wrong. Murders are up. All right. You check it. I'd like to just respond, if I might. I'd just like to respond. I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years. And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done. I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out. And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it. Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. Yeah. Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. I'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents. So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? You don't know who broke in to DNC. But what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned. Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them. Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. ""We will take out ISIS."" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. So she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them. Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Well, I have to respond. The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going. But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said... No, wait a minute. When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so. I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Just -- would you like to hear... Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out. The record does not show that. The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war. And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster. No, no. You didn't hear what I said. Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a... Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem. That would not start a war. No, they were taunting us. Wrong. It's lies. That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to... It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks. Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million... Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has. Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. I looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much. And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper. Lester, one thing I'd like to say. I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world... ... where they're not paying us what we need. And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of. She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina. The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree. But it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience. I never said that. I didn't say that. Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Where did you find this? Oh, really? OK, good. Let me just tell you... You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth? I was going to say something... ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ""I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that. But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money... ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing. The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know. Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her."
"Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again. No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what's going on. Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things. I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do. I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women. And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now. People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places. We're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth. And that's what I want to talk about. Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am. It's just words, folks. It's just words. Those words, I've been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I'm going to help the African-Americans. I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond? Sounds fair. It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don't tell me about words. I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who's also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Oh, really? Because you'd be in jail. And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document. Right? She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant. You know, it's amazing. I'm watching Hillary go over facts. And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don't think so. She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn't before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. You did that. Wait a minute. One second. If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. Oh, you didn't delete them? Oh, 33,000? Yeah. Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000? Because you have nothing to say. Get off this question. Let's see what happensƒ I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you bringing... No, it hasn't. It hasn't. And it hasn't been finished at all. It's nice to -- one on three. No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead. It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. It's only getting worse. In '17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It's very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it. It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. Well, I just want -- just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. By the way... We're going to be able to. You're going to have plans... Well, I'll tell you what it means. You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We're going to block grant into the states. We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves. Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there's always a reason for everything. If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists. And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ""radical Islamic terrorism."" Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name. First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me. Excuse me.. Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time. Why don't you interrupt her? It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. That's not been debunked. That has not been debunked. I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn't have. Well, I just want to say... Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time. Could I just respond to this, please? Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country. Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country. They're murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn't be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It's a horrible thing she's doing. She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you. Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous. Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That's one that I haven't... OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That's the good thing. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That's a big, big difference. We're talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great. Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She's a United States -- she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn't you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. ""I wish you would have done this."" But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We're getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form. We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She's raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There's no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down at 1 percent. And that's, like, no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively. Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs. A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That's why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president. Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving. Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous. So we won't make them famous. No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she's given it to us. Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn't she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn't she do something about it? She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it's all talk and no action. And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job. Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it? Oh, really? You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator. She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe... Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster. First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which... OK. But you were in contact -- excuse me. You were... You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We're tired. We're exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi's out. It's a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I'm sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone's all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There's only one problem. You don't even know who the rebels are. So what's the purpose? And one thing I have to say. I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy. OK. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree. I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly. I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn't. I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise. I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks. Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can't they do it quietly? Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying? How stupid is our country? I can't think of any. I can't think of any. And I'm pretty good at it. And we have General Flynn. And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How -- why would these people stay there? I've been reading now... ... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore. They're gone. Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul. Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East. Everything. You know what's funny? She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her. When I go one second over, it's like a big deal. It's really -- it's really very interesting. Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back. Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she's lied about a lot of things. I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what's happening to our inner cities. She's been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn't get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don't get it done. You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent. I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing's going to ever happen. Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen. It's just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She's not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors. But I will tell you, she's all talk. It doesn't get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York. It turned out to be a disaster. ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that. We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her. No, there wasn't check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens... ... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that. But she said she'll be awake. Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It's a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. I'm shocked to hear that. We have the slowest growth since 1929. It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster. Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing. What I ask is this. So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren't you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign? I'm just curious. Absolutely. I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They'll be able to compete. They'll make money. They'll pay off our national debt. They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It's a disgrace. It's an absolute disgrace. Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children. And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. I will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait."
"Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about. Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices. Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made. We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma. I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important. I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint. Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say. Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence. I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that. We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment. Right. Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states. If they overturned it, it will go back to the states. Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination. Well, I think it's terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby. Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK. But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that's not acceptable. And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that. Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders. In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border. Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders. I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It's just pouring and destroying their youth. It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty. Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out. Chris, I think it's... I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It's a disaster. Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. We are a country of laws. We either have -- and by the way... Well -- well, but she said one thing. And the wall. President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league. As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't. Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it's very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient. But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens. Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders. But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is. Thank you. That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin? So just to finish on the borders... She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin... ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person. No puppet. No puppet. You're the puppet! No, you're the puppet. She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else. She has no idea. Hillary, you have no idea. And our country has no idea. Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it. She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way. Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria. He's outsmarted her every step of the way. Yes, that's fine. By Russia or anybody else. Of course I condemn. Of course I -- I don't know Putin. I have no idea. I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad. Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it's Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the ""start up"" that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin. And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever. And she always will be. Wrong. I have 200 generals... ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century. All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons. Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie. There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me. And defend yourselves. And defend yourselves. I didn't say nuclear. And defend yourself. Yes. Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan. But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying? She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying. Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up. She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are. We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion. So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy. You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back. I am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal. And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion... ... that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP. You can't. Correct. Over a 10-year period. So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number. We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level. And I think it's going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad. Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world. I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what's happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities. Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country. Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored. And that will be as bad as NAFTA. Well, let me just say -- let me just say. Let me ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years? You were very much involved -- excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly. For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn't mind. The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me. Give me a break. Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company. And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it. And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get rid of nobody. Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people -- I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it. Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things. I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women. These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence. And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction. I did not say that. I did not say that. I did not say that. Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. Nobody has more respect... And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different. She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. What happened to the FBI, I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign. Wrong. So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It's on tape. The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things... ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false. I think that it's been very well... It's been very well studied. ... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it. It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money. So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture. Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it. They don't want you to help them anymore. I'd like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don't get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. What happens -- the money goes to them. No, it was -- we put up the American flag. And that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag. There was. There was. And, by the way... ... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets. So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars... Let me just explain. Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do. You know what she should have done? And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator... ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so. You should have changed the law. But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump... But I will tell you, I sat thereÉ ... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws. If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws. I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time. What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters. But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it. If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote. So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run. And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never... Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things. What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK? Should have gotten it. I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace. I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country. Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul. About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we're going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left. The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it. But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in. But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought. But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them. So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way. The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Chris, we don't gain anything. Iran is taking over Iraq. Iran is taking over Iraq. We don't gain anything. If they did it by surpriseÉ We could have gained if they did it by surprise. No, you are the one that's unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do. And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both. Which is a big mistake. It's a catastrophe. I mean... ... it's a mess. Have you seen it? Have you seen it? Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo? OK, so it hasn't fallen. Take a look at it. That's right. And they are being s ed... ... because of bad decisions. Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened. And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He -- he aligned with Russia. He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion. Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad. If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely... ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job. But I just have to... It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they're in 32 countries. We should have -- wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore. We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is. Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore. It's very sad. But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy. We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don't use those people. Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals. We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people. But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money. And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new. Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary. We've heard this before. Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond? Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right. And frankly, now we're going to do it right. I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow at a record rate of growth. No, it's going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster. If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent. And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. Such a nasty woman. Your husband disagrees with you. She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way. But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called ""Make America Great Again."" We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen. Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes. All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her."
"Utah and Omaha beaches. Every coastguardsman is trusted to put service before all. Coasties plunge from helicopters and barrel through pouring rain and crashing waves to save American lives. They secure our borders from drug runners and terrorists in rough seas at high speeds. Their sharpshooters take out smuggler’s engines with a single shot. They never miss. When the red racing stripes of a coast guard vessel break the horizon, when their chopper blades pierce the sky, those in distress know that the help is on their way and our enemies know their time has come.  These guardians of our waters stand: Semper Paratus. They are always ready. They are the United States Coast Guard. Representing the Coast Guard today, you will soon see an HH60 Jayhawk helicopter based at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater along with an HH65 Dolphin from Air Station Atlantic City and an HC144 Ocean Century from Air Station Miami.  Thank you. Thank you to the Coast Guard. On a cold December morning in 1903, a miracle occurred over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina when two bicycle makers from Ohio defied gravity with a 12-horsepower engine, wings made of cotton and just a few dollars in their pockets. Just six years later, America was training its first pilots to take these magnificent machines up and over the field of battle. In World War I, our fly boys rushed the skies of Europe and aces like Eddie Rickenbacker filled hearts and headlines with tales of daring duels in the clouds. General Billy Mitchell saw the promise of this technology and risked court martial in his quest for an independent air force. He was proven right when empires across the oceans tried to carve up the world for themselves and America stood in the way. We wouldn’t let it happen.  After Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle and his Raiders flew B-25 bombers off a carrier deck in the deep Pacific in a daring feat of American resolve. And as President Roosevelt said, the Nazis built a fortress around Europe, but they forgot to put a roof on it. So we crushed them all from the air. 177 liberator bombers flew dangerously low through broad daylight without fighter protection to cripple the Nazi war machine at . More than 300 airmEn gave their lives to destroy the enemy oil refineries and five pilots were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions in that single raid. It was airman, Chuck Yeager who first broke the sound barrier. It was airman like Gus Grissom and Buzz Aldrin, who traded their saber jets for rockets to the stars. And it is our incredible airmen today who wield the most powerful weapon systems on the planet Earth. For over 65 years, no enemy air force has managed to kill a single American soldier because the skies belong to the United States of America.  No enemy has attacked our people without being met by a roar of thunder. And the awesome might of those who bid farewell to Earth and soar into the wild blue yonder. They are the United States Air Force. Representing the Air Force, you will soon see beautiful brand new F-22 raptors from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. And one magnificent B-2 stealth bomber from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.  What a great country. In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward. Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy the world has ever seen. John Paul Jones, America’s first great naval hero, said “I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm’s way.” He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns. When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared I have not yet begun to fight.  When our navy begins fighting, they finish the job. The war of 1812, Captain James Lawrence fell with his brothers on the USS Chesapeake. His dying command gained immortality. “Don’t give up the ship.” In the battle of Mobile Bay, Admiral David Farragut lashed himself to the rigging of his flagship to see beyond the cannon smoke crying, “Damn the torpedoes. Full speed ahead.” In World War II, it was aviators launched from the carrier Enterprise, Hornet, Yorktown, who filled the skies of Midway and turned the tide of the Pacific War. Nobody could beat us. Nobody could come close. On D-Day, CB engineers came ashore to destroy blockades and barriers making way for the invasion. Many lost their lives, but they took the German defenses with them and our men crushed upon the beaches like a mighty storm. From the naval demolition units of World War II arose a force that became famous in the  Kang Delta. They don’t want to see our force again. The very best of the very best, the Navy Seals.  It was the Seals who delivered vengeance on the terrorists who planned the September 11th attack on our homeland. It was the Seals who stand ready to bring righteous retribution in mountain jungle desert to those who do us harm. America sailors are not born. They are forged by the sea. Their traditions are rich with the salt and blood of three centuries. When old Laurie crest the waves of foreign shores, every friend and every foe knows that justice sails those waters. It sails with the United States Navy. Representing our great Navy today will be two F-18 Super Hornets from Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia, along with two F-35 Lightnings from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California.  So great. In November of 1775, the Continental Congress created two battalions of a new kind of warrior. One who kept and would protect our ships and sailors and be at home, both ashore and in the mast with musket in hand. Their versatility was proven in the War of Independence when 234 continental marines conducted their first amphibious raid, capturing the British supply of gunpowder and cannons at Fort Nassau. Ever since, Marines have fought in every American war. Their legend has grown and grown and grown with each passing year. It was the Marines who won America’s first overseas battle, vanquishing Barbary pirates on the shores of Tripoli. Their high stiff collar, which shielded them from the pirate sword, earned them the immortal name Leatherneck. It was the Marines, who after two long days of battle, march through the halls of Montezuma. It was the Marines who took heavy casualties to kick the Kaiser’s troops out of Belleau Wood in World War One, earning the title Devil Dogs. And it was the Marines who raised the flag on the black sands of Iwo Jima. From the Chosin Reservoir to Kaesong, from Helmond to Baghdad, Marines have struck fear into the hearts of our enemies and put solace into the hearts of our friends. Marines always lead the way. After the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, which claimed the lives of 241 great US servicemen, Marine Sergeant Jeffery Nashton lay in bandages so badly wounded, barely alive. When the commandant of the Marine Corps came to visit his hospital, Sergeant Nashton had to feel for the general’s collar. He wanted to feel his four stars. He could not see and he could not speak. He signaled for pen and paper. And with shaking hand, he wrote two words: Semper Fi. That motto, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, burns in the soul of every Marine a sacred promise the core has kept since the birth of our country. They are the elite masters of air and land and sea on battlefields all across the globe. They are the United States …  All across the globe. They are the United States Marines.  Representing the Marine Corps today will be a brand new VH-92, soon to serve as Marine One, along with two V-22 Ospreys from the famed HMX-1 helicopter squadron at Quantico, the Night Hawks.  (singing)  In June of 1775, the Continental Congress created a unified army out of the revolutionary forces encamped around Boston and New York and named after the great George Washington, commander-in-chief. The Continental Army suffered a bitter winter of Valley Forge, found glory across the waters of the Delaware, and seized victory from Cornwallis of Yorktown.  Our army manned the , it  the ramparts. It took over the airports. It did everything it had to do. And at Fort McHenry, under the rockets’ red glare, it had nothing but victory. And when dawn came, their star-spangled banner waved defiant. At Shiloh, Antietam, and Gettysburg, our soldiers gave the last full measure of devotion for the true unity of our nation and the freedom of all Americans.  In the trenches of World War One, an army sergeant named Alvin York, faced an inferno of enemy fire and refused to retreat. He said, “I won’t leave. I won’t stop.” He shot his rifle 18 times, killing 18 of the enemy. When they fixed bayonets and charged, he killed seven more. The entire German machine gun battalion surrendered because of one man, Alvin York.  A generation later, the Army returned to Europe and embarked upon a great crusade with knives and rifles in hand. The Rangers scaled the cliffs of Normandy. The 101st Airborne leapt into the danger from above, illuminated only by enemy flares, explosions, and burning aircraft. They threw back the Nazi Empire with lightning of their own from the turrets of Sherman tanks and the barrels of the M1 rifle. In the darkness of the Battle of the Bulge, with Nazis on every side, one soldier is reported to have said, “They’ve got us surrounded again, the poor bastards.” Yes. Outnumbered, American warriors fought through the bunkers of Pork Chop Hill and held the line of civilization in Korea. In the elephant grass of Vietnam, the first cavalry made its stand amid a forest consumed in flame with enemies at every single turn. The army brought America’s righteous fury down to Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and cleared the bloodthirsty killers from their caves. They liberated Fallujah and Mosul and helped liberate and obliterate the ISIS caliphate just recently in Syria, 100% gone. Through centuries, our soldiers have always pointed toward home proclaiming, “This we’ll defend.” They live by the creed of Douglas MacArthur. “In war, there is no substitute for victory.” They are the greatest soldiers on Earth.  (singing)  Nearly 250 years ago, a volunteer army of farmers and shopkeepers, blacksmiths, merchants, and militiamen risked life and limb to secure American liberty and self-government. This evening, we have witnessed the noble might of the warriors who continue that legacy. They guard our birthright with vigilance and fierce devotion to the flag and to our great country. Now we must go forward as a nation with that same unity of purpose. As long as we stay true to our course, as long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.  Thank you. We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed a continent, harnessed science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens, because we will never forget that we are Americans, and the future belongs to us.  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free. We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny. We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same Almighty God.  From the banks of the Chesapeake to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes to the sand dunes of the Carolinas, from the fields of the heartland to the Everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.  So once more, to every citizen throughout our land, have a glorious Independence Day. Have a great Fourth of July. I want to thank the Army Band, the National Park Service, the Interior Department, the incredible pilots overhead, and those who are making possible the amazing fireworks display later this evening. Now as the band plays the Battle Hymn of the Republic, I invite the First Lady, Vice President and Mrs. Pence, the service secretaries, and military leaders to join me on stage for one more salute to America by the famous, incredible, talented Blue Angels. God Bless you, God bless the military, and God bless America. Happy Fourth of July.  (singing)"
"Good builder. He loved to build houses. He was a good builder. I learned so much from him, and he was a great guy. Lovely guy. Loved my father. I started off making little deals in Brooklyn and Queens with my father, and they seemed to work out. I like winning better. We have to win.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for President of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.  I was called by a major, major reporter whose name I will not use, and he said to me, “What you’ve done has never been done in the history of the United States politics,” and more and more people are resonating to what I’m saying. That’s why I’m leading in every poll.  We have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with winning.  I think I have to win. I’m about winning. Only Rosie O’Donnell.  The big problem this country has is being politically correct. I’ve been challenged by so many people, and I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. Oh yeah. You’re a tough guy, Jeff. Real tough. You’re real tough, Jeff. Well, let’s see. I’m at 42, and you’re at 3, so so far- I’m doing better. So far, I’m doing better. You started off over here, Jeff. You’re moving over further and further. Pretty soon, you’re going to be off the end.  I will build a great, great wall on the Southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall. I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller. Believe me.  Tolerance for criminal aliens is zero, zero.  No, no. You’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. See, you’re telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you’ve been fighting. No wonder you’ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.  We’re going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we’ll make it to termination as to the rest. But, we have some bad hombres here, and we’re going to get them out.  We will release my tax returns, against my lawyer’s wishes, when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted.  I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she, frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Such a nasty woman. After getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 emails, and then you acid wash them, or bleach them, as you would say, a very expensive process. So, we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what? You oughta be ashamed of yourself. Because you’d be in jail. I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election, if I win. Thank you.  Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business. Complicated business. We did have a lot of fun fighting Hillary, didn’t we? Right? We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag. From now on, it’s going to be America first, okay? America first. I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear. That I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States. So help me God. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers, and American families. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.  We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. So, let’s have a good time, right? I’m excited to be here today with thousands of proud, young American patriots. You all are great people. You’re the future. You’re the future. On behalf of my entire administration, thank you to everyone at Turning Point USA’s Teen Student Action Summit. What a group. What a group.  They don’t realize there’s more of you than there is of them. They just haven’t figured that out yet. They’ll understand. They’ll figure it out someday. They’re still trying to figure out what the hell happened. What happened? How did this happen? You’ve come to our nation’s Capitol from cities and towns across America. You’ve given up a big part of your summer, which many young people are not willing to do, and we understand that too. But what you’re doing is fun, and it’s important, so important.  You’ve paved and paved your own way to get here, and in some cases, it wasn’t easy, and you’ve done it for all of us. You’ve done it for one simple reason. You are loyal to our nation. You are devoted to your fellow citizens. And you will always put America first.  I want to thank my great friend, and he’s a young friend, he’s a pretty young guy, Charlie Kirk. I said, “How old are you, Charlie?” He’s a young one. Gave me a number I won’t say, but he’s younger than he even looks. But, I want to thank Charlie. He’s an incredible guy. His spirit is love of this country. He’s done an amazing job. He’s done something that is just incredible for someone really of his age. You need tremendous talent to do what he’s done, building one of the most powerful youth organizations ever created, Turning Point USA, and I want to thank you really, Charlie. You did an incredible job.  The young leaders here today are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation. There’s never been anything like this. And the fake news doesn’t even talk about it, because- no, but when I say it, they don’t correct me. They don’t say, “Oh, he’s a Pinocchio.” They can’t, because it’s true. It’s true. They can find fault with anything, but they never talk about that, because we won. There have been some pretty good movements, and they won New Hampshire, or they won the state, some place, but they didn’t win the whole ball game. You saw what we won.  And you could see it. We could feel it. We knew it was going to happen, because it’s a movement about reclaiming your future, rebuilding your country, and restoring your destiny, and renewing the values that are the true source of American greatness. We lost those values, and we’re getting them back rapidly. We’re getting them back rapidly.  Just backstage, a gentleman, very rich gentleman in this case, came up sitting in one of these rows, I assume. Yeah. There he is. He said, “Sir, thank you for saving our country.” And I said, “Thank you very much.” I said, “Thank you very much.” And I looked at Charlie. And I said, “Charlie, do you have any idea how many people say that?” I gave the commencement address at the Air Force Academy recently, and Indianapolis the year before. And they said, “Sir, would you like to shake the hands of all the cadets?” I said, “How many are there?” “1,100.” I said, “Yeah, that sounds okay.” I say, “Do other Presidents do it?” “Yes, they do.” “Do all of them?” “yeah, they do.” What they didn’t say is they start and then they beat around, and then they go back, because it’s tough. It was really hot. That sun was beaming down, and I’m just one hand. Some of these guys are great athletes. Some of the women, they had some women in the class that were … their hands were very strong, okay? And they were all shaking it. They’re a little nervous meeting the President. They’re shaking strongly and … sir.  But with shaking 1,100 hands, and saluting, was saluting, shaking, turning, spinning. They come at all different directions. Felt like a great fighter pilot. But, I stood up there for the whole thing. I said, “There’s no way that other Presidents have done that.” He said, “No, no, they do it, but they leave after about 50 or 60 people.” I said, “Why didn’t you tell me that?” But I’m glad I did it.  But, I did the same thing. I did the same thing at Annapolis the year before, great place. Just great. And I shook the hands of, I think, 1,011 at Annapolis, and it’s really something great. But, so many of these young incredible people, they’re like you, so many of these young incredible people, they come, “Sir, thank you for saving America.” “Sir, thank you for saving America.” “Sir, thank you for saving our country.” So many of them, it’s not rehearsed. It’s just that’s what they feel.  And you know what? Someone had to do what I did. It’s not pleasant. We have a deep state. We have banned people. We have sick people. I watched just this morning this Tlaib from Michigan, right? It’s a great state. We won Michigan. There is no way she stands for the values of the people of Michigan. But, I watched her this morning. She’s vicious. She’s like a crazed lunatic. She’s screaming. This is before she got into Congress. Who elected her? She’s screaming like a total lunatic at one of our rallies. It’s like I’m giving a little rally, and she starts screaming. And this is not a sane person, folks, when you look at that.  And this is what we’re up against. You have some of that. Now, the Democrats, I guess, are forced to embrace her, and I call it AOC plus three. Okay? AOC. AOC plus three. Not that AOC is a bargain, because she’s not. She’s no bargain. Look. We’ll go into it at some point. I’ll tell you all about AOC. I’ve got more on AOC. AOC. AOC.  But, what’s going on with that party, having to embrace them, and your other friend from an incredible state, right? A state that I’m going to win, Minnesota. You know that one. And you know why I’m going to win the state? Because of her. I almost won it last time. We came within just about a point. That’s a very … because Minnesota’s a very hard one for a Republican to win. We almost won it, one more night. I wanted to go there one more time. I said, “I’m telling you, we’re going to win Minnesota.”  You know who thought I was going to win Minnesota? You know who thought I was going to win Michigan, and Wisconsin, and North Carolina? Bill Clinton. He was telling everybody, “You better be careful.” He told people, from what I hear, he said, “The one you don’t want to run against is Trump.” And they said, “Why? Oh no, that’s good. We want to run against Trump.” No, no, you don’t.  You know, I actually knew him pretty well. We got along very well, until I decided to run for office. We actually got along. But, they didn’t want to listen to him. But, he was the only one with the instinct. The rest didn’t have. So, he came back and he said, “You know, he’s doing very well in Michigan. You could have a problem.” They said, “No, don’t worry about Michigan. We haven’t lost Michigan in decades.”  And he came back. He said, “You know, he was in Wisconsin, or something.” But he said he hears that I’m doing well in Wisconsin. They say, “Forget it. A Republican can’t win Wisconsin.” And then we won Wisconsin. Then he came back. And I say this with a certain old time affection, because I had a very good relationship with him before doing this. Now it’s a little harder for him to have a good relationship.  But, he said, “You don’t want to run against Trump. Don’t run against Trump.” Everybody said, “No, no. That’s okay. We like him.” Remember, President Obama? “He will not win. He will not win.” Okay? He goes, “Liar.” Yeah. Hey, did Obama get a Pinocchio? That’s right. Obama said, “He will not win. He will not be your President.” The anger was unbelievable. You know what? He’s right. He was a liar. Did you give Obama a Pinocchio Washington Post? He said, “He will not win.” These papers.  These papers are so bad. So yesterday, we had a story in one of the papers that I thought was good, but they’re really not. When you analyze it, there’s almost not too many of them that are. The wall. We’re building a lot of wall. But, let me just tell you. But, there are areas where they have walls that are falling down, walls that are in such bad shape. We’re trying to renovate it as much as we can. And we have a provision. We can renovate, but we can’t build new.  So, we’re taking all these years, and generally speaking, when you have an old wall that’s falling down, it’s in a better location for a wall. That’s why they had it there in the first place, as opposed to an area that’s empty. Typically, that would be true. So, these walls are old. They’re crumbling. They’re of no use. They’re falling down. So, we rip it up, build brand new foundations, pour brand new beautiful footings, and take a wall that’s two or three feet high, mostly laying on the ground, some of it only for cars, to stop cars from coming, of course. Just a metal spike.  So we would rip it out, figure it would take about a minute, and we put in deep foundation seven feet deep, and we put in 30 foot bollards, and then loaded it up with concrete, because inside, I like doing it. One of the reasons, they said, “But, you said you’re going to build a concrete wall.” Well, so actually inside the steel, we have it. So we have both. We have steel and we have concrete.  And I was saving that for later, because the only thing they can do is, “He’s building a steel wall. It’s not concrete.” Oh, sorry about that, folks. And you do have to have vision. It’s very important. You can’t just have a blank wall. You have to have vision. It’s much better for security to have the vision.  Anyway, so we’re building the wall. So, they come out with, “Donald Trump has built almost no wall.” What a lie that is, and we’re building 50 miles here, 50 miles there, 50 all in the right locations, because there used to be walls, but then we had to take them down. In some cases, if they’re good enough, we’re renovating, because we can do it for a lot less money. But generally, some of these walls are worthless. Literally, you just drive right over them. They’re laying down on their side.  They gave me no credit. If you ready the story, they’ll say, “Well, he has renovated a lot of wall.” Well, that’s not even a renovation. Let’s face it. That’s a brand new wall. It’s all a brand new wall. It just shows you how dishonest this fake news is, and this is what we have to deal with. This is really what we have to deal with. But, get used to it.  Many of you will be in politics. Just get used to it, okay? Get used to it. Together, is this true? We believe in the American Constitution, and we believe judges should interpret our Constitution as written. You’ll be seeing this. We believe in religious liberty, the right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Second Amendment. What a group. Look. Look. They are in the process of trying to take your arms away. You have the Second Amendment. They will do damage to the Second Amendment, the likes of which nobody even thought of. That’s where they’re coming from. Just remember, I said it. Hopefully, they never get the chance. And that’s why the election coming up … I always said this is the most important election, 2016, most important election that we’ve ever had.  And it was certainly the coolest. That’s for sure. But, it was, I believe, the most important election, because our country was going wrong. It was going wrong. And when you see all the incredible numbers coming up, and all the success that we’re having, and all the fact that we’re respected all over the world. We have a really good man who’s going to be the Prime Minister of the UK now, Boris Johnson.  Good man. He’s tough, and he’s smart. This ain’t Britain Trump. They call him Britain Trump. And people are saying, “That’s a good thing.” They like me over there. That’s what they wanted. That’s what they need. That’s what they need. He’ll get it done. Boris is good. He’s going to do a good job. I think Nigel’s some place in this audience. Where’s Nigel? Where is he? Nigel Farage. He’s here some place. I saw him. I said, “What is he doing here?” He’s a little older than most of you. Where is he? Nigel. Nigel.  I’ll tell you what. He got 32% of the vote from nowhere, over in the UK. Nigel, thank you Nigel. I said, “What’s Nigel doing here?” He’s a little older than you folks. But, he did a great job. But, I know that he’s going to work well with Boris. They’re going to do some tremendous things. But, we believe in the American dream, and not a socialist nightmare that these people are trying to put on our shoulders.  And we know that strong nations must have strong borders, and we’re building a strong border against so much. You have no idea. Every time I announce, as an example, a section of wall, I get lawsuits. They sue me. You know who sues me? Congressmen. Congressmen. I get sued by Nancy Pelosi. We won that suit. Can you believe it? I won one. We won a couple of them, but we have suits on the border. We had one judge. They always sue in the ninth circuit. You know what that means, right?  They sue in the ninth circuit, which is sort of like an automatic victory, although we did win one last week in the ninth circuit. No one can even believe it. Can you? You know what’s happening, right? Do you know what’s happening? So as of today, this is so important, there are those that say it’s the most important. I would say war and peace and security, that’s the most important. But, they say the most important thing a President can do is the selection of Supreme Court justices, right?  We have two, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. We have two. Already, we have two. Some have gone a long time, and they haven’t had many, and they haven’t had any, in some cases. So, we have two already. And they’re great, and they’re good. But, what people don’t talk about, I’ve just signed the 124th federal district judge, federal judges underneath. And within a couple of months, I’ll be up to 147. Think of that. 147. Because normally, when you become President, you go in, and you say, “Do I have any judges to appoint?” No. Because it’s such an important thing. Because these district judges, they’re the ones who do the trials. This is big stuff.  And then, you have court of appeals judges. Then, you have the Supreme Court judges. So, we have two on the Supreme Court. We have many appeals court judges, many that we’ve appointed. The courts are a whole different thing. But, I will be up to 147, not including the two Supreme Court justices.  Now, percentage wise, I blow everybody away except one person, one person I’ll never beat. You know who the one person is? Who? George Washington. He’s got 100%. George Washington. But, we’re going to have a tremendous percentage, and after six more years, it will go to a level that nobody believed was possible.  But, George Washington’s hard to beat because he put in 100, because he was the first, so he had it. But, I have many more than George Washington. Remember that. George Washington didn’t put in too many, but he had certainly the highest percentage. That will be a record that will never be broken.  We believe that every young American should love our country, honor our history, and always respect what? Our great American flag. How about the Betsy Ross? Isn’t that terrible, where they try to take your heritage away from you like that? Isn’t that terrible?  Like that, isn’t that terrible? Isn’t that terrible? And then, you see the picture of President Obama with the same exactly leg up. He should’ve taken it down. Why didn’t he take it down? It’s really very unfair what they do. They try and demean and belittle, and they’re very good at it. They’re better at than they are at politics. They’re better than that then they are at policy. Look at their policy. They want open borders, which means crime, which means drugs and human trafficking, which is a phenomenon that you would think is thousands of years old, and that would’ve been their prime. No, the prime is now because of the internet. Women, mostly women, are being trafficked, and they got not only in this country, all over the world. It’s never been like this before. Human trafficking, they snatch women, and they traffic women, and they sell women, and we can’t get the Democrats to even give us a modicum of the money we need at the border, especially for the wall. I’m taking money from here and there and there and there. Let’s take it from here. We have all these different sources coming from all over the place because they won’t approve it, and five years ago, they all wanted it.  Six years ago, seven years ago, they all voted for it. They never got it built, but they all voted for it, and today, they make it so tough. You have to see. I’m doing everything I can, and we’re doing well with it, but this should just be one nice, fat sum where I could get the best four or five contractors, not worry about I gave it out, but I have a lawsuit, and if the lawsuit happens, I have to undo it. How do you give a contract out where you have a contractor, and he’s got to build 67 miles of wall? We have one case, but we’re being sued, our funding source, because we’re taking it from a certain area, and so, we’re being sued. So, we have to wait for the suit. I mean, how would you like to be building like this? Not good, it’s not good, but we’re getting it done anyway, but they should say, “It’s not working without the wall. You got to have the wall. You got to have … ” When they bum rush you, they did that last week. They rushed in a tremendous large number of people. By the way, you know why they’re coming up right? Because we have created the strongest economy in the history of our country. So, they’re coming because they want a piece of the economy.  They’re not coming up for safety and this and that. You ever see these people? They fly their flag. They come up from Guatemala, who by the way, went back on their word to us. They were all set to sign a safe third agreement, and then, today or yesterday, they announced they can’t do it because they’ve got a Supreme Court ruling, their Supreme Court, right? They got . In other words, they didn’t want to sign it. So, they’re supposed to sign what’s called a safe third. That’s a good thing for us, okay? That’s all I have to tell you, and they went back. So, we’re going to do either tariffs, or we’re going to do a form of tax, or we’re going to use our ban. People don’t realize we won the ban. I saw one of the journalists, we’ll call them, who happens to be back there, I believe. One of them, look at all those cameras. Isn’t that terrible or good or whatever? Wouldn’t it be great if they told the truth? They have such a low credibility. They started off very high, and then, I ran, and their credibility is so low, you wouldn’t believe it. But that’s okay, but wouldn’t it be nice if they … Think of it. Think of it. What would be if we had an honest … I don’t want a media that’s for me. I just want an honest media. So, we have our best poll numbers today that we’ve ever had. Can you imagine how good our poll numbers, with all the things that we’ve done, how good our numbers would be if we had just a fair media? Because they can take any- He goes 100%. Who said that? Stand up. Huh? You bet. He goes 100%, and you know what? I like your long hair. It’s very nice, actually. Good. Thank you. Thank you. That’s funny. So, above all else, we know this, that in America, we don’t worship government. We worship God.  I’m not disavowing that they like me. Would you disavow that? No, thank you. The squad. No, it’s very good, very true. These are the values that unite everyone in this room. These are the values that inspire hundreds of thousands of Turning Point usa members and more than 1400 college and high school campuses in all 50 states. It’s incredible what’s been done with Turning Point and the job, Charlie, and everybody. I met all of the people backstage just a little while ago. These are people that love our country. It’s amazing what they’ve done, the job they’ve done and in a pretty short period of time. And I was telling Charlie, too, and I’ve said it before, ” Remember, you are not in the minority. Most people are with you.” There was a young woman today. I saw her on a beauty pageant, and she has conservative values, and the pageant, which used to compete against my pageant … I did much better, but that’s okay. I had the Miss Universes. This is a different company, but I sold it. I figured when you run for office, I sold it to IMG, great company, very nice deal, too.  But when you run for office, owning a beauty pageant is not the greatest idea. Do we agree? Owning the Miss Universe and Miss usa and Miss Teen usa, by the way, was not exactly good with maybe running for president. So, we sold it to IMG, but what they did to this young lady was terrible, and she was on Fox and Friends this morning wearing a Make America Great Again hat, which was pretty cool, which was pretty cool. Each of you is coming of age at a time of unlimited possibility. It’s true, better than, I think, ever before. We have the hottest economy on the planet Earth, and I was elected. We’ve created more than six million new jobs. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, think of that. Unemployment for young Americans age 16 to 19 has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Wages are rising, and they’re growing fastest for blue collar workers. Isn’t that great, though? People don’t talk about that. Young people have seen their wages rise by more than 10%. That’s a lot quickly, too.  Our economic revival is incredible, and it’s incredible news for everyone graduating from college or joining the workforce. This is the best time in the history of our country for young people like yourself to join the workforce because America’s thriving. America’s booming, and America is winning again and winning like never before. It’s never been winning like this, and we did it through a lot of hard work. It’s not luck. I will tell you. If our opponent, if my opponent won, instead of having record stock markets and record employment numbers, you would’ve been in, in my opinion, a major recession, if not a depression. You would’ve gone down like a rock. Look what happened right after the election. The stock market was like a rocket ship because of enthusiasm. People wanted to have us win. It’s not me. It’s us. It’s all of us. It’s a movement. It’s us, and the market . We cute our record number of job-killing regulations. We passed historic tax cuts so that our industries can compete and win against anyone in the world. We are revising decades of ruinous trade deals that ravaged our communities and pillaged our factories. We were sending companies out of our country, great companies. They were leaving us, going to Mexico, going to China, going to so many other places.  The deals we made were the dumbest deals in the history of this world. It was unbelievable. 60,000 factories and plants and businesses closed up. Think of it. 60,000, you would say, “How is that possible?” You get a map, take 60,000 … You would say it’s impossible. 60,000 factories, plants, companies destroyed. Not destroyed, they went a different way. They were given no incentives to stay here. Some of the dumbest legislation ever passed, NAFTA. The World Trade Organization has been a horrible thing for us. That’s what built China. That and the fact that our former presidents did nothing about the fact that China was making hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and I guess they didn’t see it. I mean, 25 years they didn’t see it, but we see it, and right now, they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars, folks, billions. And they want to make a deal badly, and we’ll see whether or not we’ll make a deal. We’ll see. We’ll see, but our farmers are being helped. I said to our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, because China, very smart. I don’t blame them. Look, I’m not blaming them. I blame our past leaders for allowing it to happen.  I’m not blaming China. We should’ve done that to them. I blame our past leaders. I said that to President Xi of China. I said it, but I said to Sonny Perdue, “So, Sonny, they’re targeting us.” They said. They actually took ads in the Des Moines register, anti-Trump. I love Iowa, too. It says Iowa loves you. I love Iowa. Well, ethanol is doing pretty well in Iowa, too, right? But they took ads in the Iowa papers, and it was anti-Trump ads, right? And then, they stopped buying a lot of the product, almost everything. They stopped buying from our farmers because they knew that was my strength. The whole middle of the country is red. You saw that in the clip. That clip was fantastic. By the way, Charlie, that clip was so good, I would’ve rather seen it a second time, and I could’ve come on a little bit later. I like it, but that clip was great. But you see, the whole center’s all bright red, meaning Republican, all read, and just those little edges are blue. So, they targeted the red. Nobody’s said China’s stupid, and they said, “We’re not going to buy product.” And essentially, they really closed it up.  So, we’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs from China. They never gave us 25 cents, and I said to my Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue’s great, I said, “Sonny, what’s the biggest year that we’ve ever had with China? How much money did they spend in the United States?” “Sir, I’ll get back to you.” He gets back to me the next day. “Sir, $16 billion.” I say, “All right. We’ll take $16 billion out of our tariffs,” which are many times that amount that they are paying us in tariffs. They never paid us 25 cents. We’ll take $16 billion out. That’s the highest they’ve ever paid, and we’ll use that toward the farmers and distribute it. This way, nobody gets hurt. And no other president’s doing that for the farmers, or no other president’s going to save the miners and save energy. We’re the number one producer of energy now in the world, and when I came, it was heading in the wrong direction. It was heading in a very bad direction. Right now, we’re bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia and bigger than anybody. And we know that our first duty and our one true allegiance is to the American nation and to the American citizen, the usa.  Loyalty to our people is our guiding light. It’s our north star and our unwavering conviction. We have secured record funding to build up awesome might for the United States military because we know the best way to prevent conflict is to be prepared for it. So, when you’re strong, strong, strong, it’s okay. They’re going to leave you alone. They said, “Let’s pass.” We had a depleted military. We built up our military. We had jets so well they didn’t fly. We had a large percentage of fighter jets that were out. We had that old Navy. We’re building brand new submarines, brand new ships. We’re building tremendous F35s, F18s. We’re building a military, the likes of which even we have never had because we have to. New missiles, we make the greatest equipment in the world. I hate to mention this word, but we’re renewing and renovating our nuclear arsenal like never before, and we hope to God that we never have to use it. That’s what I say. We hope to God we never have to use it, but we have to have it ready. We have to have it as a horrible, to me, the most horrible alternative that can happen is that, but we have nuclear, the likes of which nobody’s ever had, like we have, and all pray that we never have to use it.  Our agenda is pro-worker and pro-family. We’re making childcare more affordable, expanding access to vocational education, so important, and our pledge to America’s workers had secured commitments to provide more than nine million apprenticeships and job opportunities for industries all over the country. We’re helping people get jobs. We’re helping Walmart and so many companies. They went out. They went all out. They went all out, and they’re working. And they’re working with a person you may have heard of, perhaps not, Ivanka Trump. She loves it. She loves it. She loves it. I’ll tell you, she didn’t need it. She loves it. More than anything, that’s what she loves because she says we’re providing so many jobs, and they’re training people. And the government can’t really train them. When you go into these big companies, the Caterpillars and all of these, you’ve got to sort of be trained by the people that do it, the complexity, the aerospace. Lockheed Martin has been great. Boeing has been great. There’s so many, and they can train much better than the government. The government, really, wouldn’t know where to begin. So, they’re training. We’re going to have close to 10 million very shortly, and Ivanka really has done an incredible job on that.  I might as well give her credit because the media will never give her credit. She’s my daughter. I’ll give her credit, but it’s true, and you know what? If she didn’t do a good job, I don’t know that I’d say that, but I wouldn’t be talking about her. That I can tell you. I’d probably just fluff over it. She’s done an incredible job. There’s truly never been a better time to be young and American. There’s never been a better time because our future is the brightest than it’s ever been. A new poll only … You’ve got to hear this. How about this whole witch hunt that’s going on? Should I talk about it for a second? The Russian witch hunt, okay? First of all, it’s very bad for our country. Makes it very hard to deal with Russia, and we should be able to. They’re a nuclear power. They have a big country, and we should be able to deal with them without having this artificial stuff, but think of it. Only 11% in a new poll favor the starting of this ridiculous impeachment hearings that are going on. You hear about it. So, I said this morning, I wrote it out. I said, “Let’s see,” because I’m watching. It goes on for years and years and years, no collusion, no obstruction. Oh, that’s not good enough. Let’s go more. $40 million dollars, interview 500 people, they’ve got nothing. I could find something. I could take anybody in this audience. Give me 40 million, give me unlimited FBI, unlimited interviews. They interviewed 500 people. Listen to this, 2500 subpoenas, they did everything. The collusion, no collusion, they have no collusion. Then, I have an article, too, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president, but I don’t even talk about that because they did a report, and there was no obstruction. After looking at it, our great Attorney General read it. He’s a total professional. He said, “There’s nothing here. There’s no obstruction.”  So, they referenced no obstruction. So, you have no collusion, no obstruction, and yet, it goes on. And they think this is helping them. I personally think it’s hurting them. A lot of people think it’s very bad for them, but it just goes on. I wrote something out this morning on a thing called Twitter, whether we like it or not. It is a good way of getting the word out because I saw Mueller’s testifying tomorrow again. How many times? Two-and-a-half years, and actually, it started practically from the time I came down on the escalator. They said, “He’s got good numbers. We better start looking at him right away. Maybe he’s dealing with a foreign country.” I’m saying, “What are you talking about?” Listen to this. I wrote this out this morning. I said on Twitter, “Well, let’s see. We have the best economy in history,” and it used to be it’s the economy’s stupid, right? It’s the economy, nothing else. It’s the economy’s stupid. So, we have the best economy in history, the best employment numbers in history, the most people working, almost 160 million, in the history of our country. The most people working, that’s a big number.  So, we have the best economy, the best unemployment numbers, most people working. On Thursday, we have the highest stock market in the history of our country, and a lot of you with 401(k)s, now, that’s not a rich people thing. The people that own that stock are people with 401(k)s, everything else. We have the best stock market in the history of our country. We just got the biggest tax and regulation cuts in the history of our country. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare. We got, perhaps, the biggest energy site in the world approved in Alaska called ANWR. Nobody could do it from Ronald Reagan to present, they said, “Can’t do it.” We got ANWR approved. We have the best and newest military that we’ve ever had, almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military that I inherited two-and-a-half years ago. Our military was totally depleted from these ridiculous, endless wars. So, we have the best, newest military in history, and the VA, you don’t hear any problems anymore, do you? Remember, you’d hear so many problems. We have the best VA in history, and I got choice.  That’s one of the things that’s working so that if a person has to wait for three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, can you imagine you go to a doctor, they say come back in six weeks? People were coming back that were sick, and they were coming back, and they were terminal. They could’ve been saved. They were waiting so long. So, I’ve got choice. If you have to wait, you go out, you see a doctor, we pay the bill, okay? The least important things is we save money. That’s the least important thing in that case, but we do save money, but we also have a very happy VA. They love it. Those are just a few of the things. So, we have all of this, the best economy, best market, best military, best VA, best everything and much, much more. And then, I say in this statement this morning, “Gee, let’s impeach the president.” I mean, you figured. These people have gone totally crazy. They’ve gone totally crazy. It is sort of nuts. That’s true. I guess that was a Clinton statement, right? It’s the economy’s stupid. Is that Clinton? But it’s not everything about the economy. It’s not everything, a lot of other things, but we’re at the top of every single thing that we do.  When you think our military, and you look at … And let me tell you something I didn’t put. We are respected as a country again. They respect us because other countries have been ripping us off so badly, and some of the worst offenders are our so-called allies. They rip us off on trade. European Union is worse to us on trade than China, okay? Nobody would think that. A lot of us come from European Union. We come from Europe, our grandparents, our great-grandparents. So, you think, “Oh, isn’t that nice?” Except they kill us, the European Union. It was formed in order to beat us economically, and yet, we protect them with NATO. So, they rip us off on trade, and we protect them with military, but here’s the problem with the protection. They’re not paying their bills. So, they United States, I’ve got a $100 billion more on the last two years, 100 billion. I got them to pay. I said, “You got to pay.” Nobody else has ever done that. It was like this with every other president. President Obama would go meet them. He talked nice, I don’t know, to me, not so nice.  Some people would say, “Oh, isn’t that a wonderful speech?” I said, “No. I fell asleep during that speech. I fell asleep.” I don’t get it. I don’t get it. He never got crowds like we get. That, I can tell you. So, we’ve got to be doing something right, but think of this. So, they weren’t paying their bills. So, we’re paying for close to 100% of NATO. So, here’s the story. They rip us off on trade. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for certain groups like farmers and others to go in. They rip us in trade, and then, we protect them, and they rip us on that, too, and they don’t pay their bills. Other than that, it’s a wonderful deal. So, we’re getting it straightened out, folks. We’re getting it straightened out. Somebody said, “President Obama is much more popular in Germany than Donald Trump.” Well, he should be. He should be because Germany is the biggest offender. They don’t pay. They’re paying one percent. We’re paying 4.3% of a much bigger GDP. Germany doesn’t want to pay. They’re supposed to pay two percent. They’re paying one percent, and I say, “You got to pay, Angela. You’ve got to pay, Angela. Please pay, Angela.”  And then, they say, “Who do you like better, Obama or President Trump?” Oh, I like President Obama. He was a . Look, if I start getting good poll numbers over there, I’m not doing my job, okay? That’s the way it is. That’s true. I’m not doing my job. But they still like me, and I have a good relationship and a great relationship with some, but somehow, even in this era of unprecedented prosperity and peace, the timeless traditions and values that make the American dream possible are under attack like no one has ever seen before. These people have lost all control, and even the Democrats, they’re left, but now, they’re getting dragged into a radical left position. I can’t imagine who’s doing that, but they’re being dragged radical left with these people that I believe, honestly, I believe they hate our country, okay? I believe they hate our country, and it’s true. When I watched this maniac Tlaib screaming and shouting, and this was before she was a Congress person. Can you believe it?  But screaming and shouting, out of control, and then, you see now they have another clip where she’s even worse. This is representing us? This is not what we want representing us, I don’t think. And I think it’s why we’re going to have a tremendous victory in 2020. These people are crazy. And when I have one of the others, I guess this is Cortez. I said, “I’m not going .” Sir, her name is Alexandria, and the guy couldn’t figure out her second name. It was so funny. I’m being interviewed by one of you. Her, her name is Alexandria. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, sir. Okay. He never got it out. He never found his notes. I said, “That’s okay.” I told him, “Just call her Cortez because I don’t have time to call her by the whole name. It’s too long.” It’s true. You’re doing an interview, but she called our country and our people garbage. She said garbage. That’s worst than deplorable. Remember deplorable? Oh, yes, you do. Remember Hilary, the deplorables. She actually said a word that was worse. She said deplorables, and what was the second word? Irredeemables. That’s right. She said irredeemables. She said- She said deplorables and irredeemables, and when she said it, I said, “Boy, that irredeemables is really a bad … ” Well, that was not the one. You never know in politics, right? It’s a tough business. You say a word, and you’re gone. One wrong word, you can make 20 great speeches, brilliant. They say, “He’s great, the greatest orator, the greatest orator of our times. He’s the great.” One word, and you’re gone, except for Trump because we represent you, because we represent you. Thank you. Thank you. No, but it’s true. It’s a tough business. One word, and you’re gone. It’s an incredible kind of a profession to have. That’s why they’re scared. They ago around. They’re petrified. They’re petrified that they’re going to insult 15 people and lose an election by calling out these four people, The Squad. By calling them out because we don’t like when they talk about evil Jews. We don’t like when they say horrible things about Israel. People are opposed to Israel, and they can express their opposition, but when they say it with venom, hatred, and language that nobody would use, nobody would use, it’s incredible, and then, you don’t have the Democrats fighting for Israel, and they end up passing things that have nothing to do with what the original problem was. You saw that. So, I don’t know what they’re going to do. I don’t know. They have a big problem because they others in these four. I could name another 20 right now without looking at a note. I could name another 20 that I think are, in many ways, worse. They’re worse. They’re not in this group, but they’re worse than this group, and they’re Democrats, and at some point, we will be naming them, if you don’t mind, because we want to get the word out. We have to get the word out.  As conservatives, we’re grateful for the great heritage that we have, the heritage of being an American. It’s so important to all of us. We know that America is the most just and virtuous republic ever conceived. I mean, we fight for other countries. I was with other countries two weeks ago, and we had the G20, and I’m talking to different people. Who do you fight for? Just our country. Who do you fight for? Just our country. Who do you fight for? And we fight for all these countries, and it costs us a fortune, and some of the countries are really wealthy. By the way, I’ve gone to all of them saying they have to now pay for their military. Okay. If you don’t mind that, okay. They haven’t done it. I mean, we’re fighting for countries that are so wealthy, some have nothing but cash. Nobody ever asks them, “Why aren’t you paying us for this? Why aren’t you reimbursing us for the cost?” But we now ask those questions. On the Straits, so, we get very little oil from the Straits anymore. In fact, yesterday, it was very interesting. They said, “It’s very interesting. There are no USA tankers here. They’re all from China, from Japan.”  China gets 65% of their oil from the Straits, right? Japan gets 25%. Other countries get a lot. And I said, “So, let me ask you just a really stupid question.” We hardly use it. We’re getting 10% only because we sort of feel an obligation to do it. We don’t need it. We’ve become an exporter. Can you believe it? We’re an exporter now. We don’t need it. And yet, we’re the ones that, for many, many decades, we’re the ones that policed it. We never got reimbursed. We police it for all these other countries, and I said a while ago, I said, “Why are we policing for China? Very rich. For Japan? Very rich. For all these other … ” And we’re policing also for countries, some of whom we’re very friendly with, like Saudi Arabia and others, UAE, others, too. But-  … Saudi Arabia, and others, UIE, others too. But why are we doing it without … Why do we have our ships there, and we’re putting our ships in the site. We did shoot down that drone the other day. It’s funny, for religious people, they lie a lot. They lie a lot. You can see it laying right down on the bottom of that beautiful bed of water. They say they never shot down a drone, then they say about, “We have captured 17 Americans,” I said, “No, no, that’s …” First thing I did, I call up the CIA, “Sir, totally false.” Okay. By the way, totally false, but they make up stories. I just say, for religious people, they lie a lot.  We know the story of America is the story of good defeating evil. We protect so many people, and in some cases we shouldn’t have been doing it. It’s right overcoming wrong, and it’s freedom smashing tyranny. Americans are the patriots who threw off an empire, won an independence, settled the wild west, ended slavery, secured civil rights, pushed the boundaries of science, vanquished the Nazis, brought Communism to its knees, and put a man on the moon many, many years ago.  We will become the first nation to land astronauts on Mars where they will proudly plant a very beautiful American flag. Yet, despite all that we have achieved, despite the glory and grandeur of our nation, the radical left has nothing but contempt for American heritage. I’m talking about the radical left among us, I’m not talking about the radical left that are looking over failed countries like Venezuela and others, I’m talking about the radical left among us. They see our history as a source of shame, our traditions and our victories as relics to be replaced, our values as obstacles to be removed, our citizens as subjects to be controlled, and America as a menace to be constrained. That’s what they say, that’s what they say.  The agenda of the radical left is one of division, discord, and demolition. When I see her running, and ranting, and screaming like a total lunatic, this is what we’re dealing with. You can never have a country with values like that, just look at it. There’s no reasoning. The language she uses. I mean, she was throwing a certain F bomb, right? Do we know the F? She was throwing that out about the presidency, and about the president, and such a sad thing to see how low have we gone. The far left has one fundamental objective, and that’s the objective of power. The power to control you, the power to control your family, and the power to destroy the foundations of our great republic. But we will not let them. It will never happen. It will never happen.  It will never happen. They’re, right now, destroying themselves, and they’re going after everything, they’re doing things that nobody can believe. The people that I’m looking, they said, “Who’s your toughest opponent?” I said, “So far, I dream about these people that I’m looking at.” There is no Winston Churchill in the midst, there is nobody that we look at. But you have to be very careful. Socialism is not as easy to beat as you think. When you’re wealthy, and you’re doing record stock, so you have 401ks, and you have all of the things that you have, and everybody’s doing well. Somebody comes along, says, “We’re going to give you free everything, everything’s going to be free. By the way, we’re going to raise your taxes to 75%.” But they don’t mean that, because they can’t nearly pay, 90%, and that won’t pay for it either. Won’t even come close.  “We’re going to do the Green New Deal,” which is the craziest thing I’ve ever heard. It’s crazy. But don’t kid yourself, not as easy when I’m up there on the debate all alone with some maniac that they chose. That maniac is saying. “We’re going to do this for you, we’re going to do that for you, we’re going to give you everything. We’re going to give you … Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. Every family. We’re going to take better care of illegal immigrants than we take care of our citizens,” they tell you. When they’re saying all of this stuff, and then those illegals get out and vote, because they vote anyway. Don’t kid yourself, those numbers that California and numerous other states, they’re rigged. You got people voting that shouldn’t be voting.  They vote many times, not just twice, not just three times. It’s like a circle. They come back, they put a new hat on. They come back, they put a new shirt on. In many cases, they don’t even do that. You know what’s going on. It’s a rigged deal. For example, the radical left is waging an unprecedented assault on the rule of law in America. They are. They want to eliminate our borders and totally abolish ICE, and now they want to abolish a thing called Homeland Security.  That means going on airplanes without any security, that means doing all of the things that you do, and you appreciate it, but you don’t even see what’s going on. But they now want to abolish Homeland … They started off with ICE. Let me tell you, these ICE people are great patriots. That’s a tough job. They go into these MS-13 gangs, and even your local law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. These gangs are mean, they’re tough. They deal in a medieval style. They cut people up medieval style, because it’s more painful. These are sick people. We don’t want them. We’re taking them out by the thousands out of our country, by the thousands.  With raging anger, ignorance, and malice, the far left has slandered, libeled, and speared our law enforcement heroes. They just go after our law enforcement, it’s so sad to see. They’re so respected, and yet they don’t know it because all they do is they see the negativity put on by the media. The American people forcefully reject these hate filled attacks, and that’s what they do, the hate filled, and they are indeed attacks, on our very brave public servants. Americans will always stand with courageous men and women of ICE, and border patrol, and law enforcement, always.  The hard left is also waging war against freedom of speech. The greatest threat to this radical left agenda is the truth. The problem is, we’re not getting the truth from the media, for the most part. Some, yes. But for the most part, we don’t get the truth. I can tell you stories where I’ll do something, and let’s say it’s good, they’ll make it look bad. Let’s say it’s great, things that you can’t look bad, you can’t … They’ll make it look okay. And if it’s bad … That is correct. That is correct. What they’re doing is unthinkable, and they’ve hurt themselves so badly. They’ll say, “Seven sources have said that this took place in the White House,” or something. There are no seven sources, they make them up. They make them up. There are no … They have gone … They used to call up and say, “We’d like to just verify this statement, or verify a quote.” They don’t even call up anymore. We don’t hear from The New York Times, which is totally crooked. We don’t hear from The New York Times, The Washington Post, which is the Amazon, I always say it’s the Amazon lobbyists. We don’t hear from these people. They don’t call up and say, “We’d like to check a quote.”  I don’t see anymore where they say, “Jim Smith of the White House made the following statement.” It’s always, “A source, who decided to remain anonymous from the White House.” Sometimes they’ll say, “Seven people from the White …” they don’t exist. It’s a lie. They don’t check, they don’t do anything. They’re really, really dishonest people. I’ll tell you, when I say the enemy of the people, when I say the fake news, when I say these things, I’m not kidding. It’s really dishonest. They have become, they like the word “unhinged,” they have become, the media has become totally unhinged. They used to call. When I was a … I used to get the greatest publicity. When I was doing buildings, I was happy, no problems. I was doing buildings, I didn’t have to worry about North Korea, Iran. I didn’t have to worry about China and trade. You think it’s easy beating China on trade, guess what, we’re beating them on trade. We’re beating them on a lot. We’re beating everybody. But it’s not easy.  I used to get the best publicity. Now I haven’t had a good story in two and a half years. I’m dying for my first good story, they’re going to give me one someday. I think when I get one, it will be time. I’ll say, “I’ve just achieved something.” I’ll say, “First Lady, they love our First Lady. It’s the First Lady.” They love our First Lady. I’ll say, “First Lady, I just got a good story. It’s time to hang it up. It’s time.” Some day we’re going to get them. We’re going to get them, because nobody’s done what we’ve done in two and a half years. Nobody even close. We’ve done in the first two and a half years more than any president in the history of our country.  Anyone who speaks the truth is shouted down, censored, de platformed, fired, expelled, harassed, intimidated, abused, and even, in many cases, assaulted. The don’t go after certain of our people. Bikers for Trump, you ever seen these guys? The bikers. They leave them alone, our construction workers, they leave them alone. Our law enforcement, they leave them alone. Anybody that looks real tough and real nasty, they leave them alone. They only go after somebody that stands there and is not a fighter, nothing wrong with that, and they beat the hell out of them, and they pummel him like what happened two weeks ago. They pummel him. That’s the only one they go after. They’ll go after that. They say, “Is he a fighter?” “No, let’s hit him over the head with sticks and bats,” what they do.  It’s a horrible thing. But they don’t do it to many of our people, but they look for the people that aren’t the fighters. These dangerous behaviors are the hallmarks of socialism, but socialism cannot survive when people are free to think for themselves. That’s why America will never be a socialist country, it’s never going to happen.  Thank you. Because as patriots we cherish our first amendment, we believe that every American has the God given right to speak his or her mind, and no one can ever take away that right. For centuries, Americans freely exchanged their ideas in the public square. Now the public square exists online, and massive, multi-national tech companies have gained enormous power to sensor opinions, shape public perception, and really to decide what information citizens are going to be given. I see it all the time, I see it on social media for me. I have people coming up all the time, “We want to follow you sir, they make it so hard to follow you.” I have millions and millions of people, but it should be much more. I know exactly what’s happening. I know when it started. But the only thing I do say is this, it’s happened from the beginning. Facebook, Twitter, Google, all of them. They come to me when they want help.  They want help because the Democrats want to shut them down, can you believe it? How stupid is that for them? But maybe they don’t have the power that we think, because they were totally against me in the election, and I’m standing now before you as the President of the United States, so maybe they don’t have the power.  Maybe they don’t. I don’t know. Everyone tells me when you read, they talk about this tremendous power, and I’m saying, “That’s right, they’re making it impossible.” Then somebody will look at me, “But sir, you won.” But they’re gaining more, and more, and more, and we’re looking at a lot of things, because they have not treated us as Republicans and conservatives. Even when you get into religion, they have not treated us fairly. They haven’t treated us fairly. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. That is why I’ve asked my administration to explore every possible regulatory and legislative solution, because you have to have free speech. You have to have free speech. I’ve also instructed federal agencies to hold our public colleges and universities accountable when they do numbers. You go up to speak, and what they do to our people is just … By the way, I’m President, of all the people, everybody. Everybody. I love everybody. I have people maybe I shouldn’t love. I love this nation. This nation is made up not only of us, it’s made up of everybody.  But what they do is so unfair. Any college that refuses now to respect your first amendment rights will be asking for billions and billions of dollars, and they won’t be getting it. They won’t be getting it. Signed.  All signed up, anyone can become a target of the left’s brutal campaign to punish to . Hey, I’m the number one target in the world, and here we are. But I’m the number one target. Who’s more of a target than me? No matter what you do, I’m the great target for these people, these people are crazy. Earlier this year, in Park City, Utah, a leftist released pepper spray into a high school auditorium to shut down a Turning Point USA meeting. 20 students and teachers had to immediately seek major medical attention. Think of that. One of the students from that school joins us today, Ryan Zinc. Where are you Ryan? Get over here, Ryan, come on up, come up. Come up here.  Come up here, Ryan.  Say a few words. Great job. You know, he had no idea that was going to happen, but he started to like it. I said, “You know, this could be a long time.” He’ll be in office someday, or doing something fantastic. Thank you, Ryan, great job.  In May, faculty at West Haven High School in Connecticut tried to ban the local chapter of Turning Point USA because students hung up a sign that read, “America is the best country in the world.” Can you believe that?  It is the best country in the world. One board of education member viciously smeared the students as racists, sexists, bullies who are brainwashed by their Republican parents. But the attacks have only strengthened the group’s resolve, and membership has skyrocketed since then. We are winning, we are winning.  With us today is that Turning Point USA chapter president, Dan Gallipoli. Dan, I want to just thank you for that fight. Where’s Dan? Dan, do you want to come up, Dan? Come on up, Dan. He wants to come up. Come up. Come on up. Come on up here, Dan.  . Come on up. Great job. .  Whoa. That’s fantastic, Dan. Now I see why he’s president of his chapter. Who wants to fight him? Thank you, Dan, great job. Last year Hunter Richer, where’s Hunter? Hunter, do you want to come up, Hunter? Come on up, Hunter.  Hunter’s a high school sophomore in San Antonio, Texas. Great place. He just wanted to get hamburger with a couple of his friends, and Hunter happened to be wearing a beautiful red cap, that said Make America Great Again. A 30-year-old man flew into a rage, stole Hunter’s hat. Oh, I knew that, that was a pretty famous deal, that was all over the place, right? Threw a drink at him, and called him a racial slur. Thankfully it was all captured on video, and the assailant was arrested and .  We all watched that event many times, that scene many times. Hunter, thank you for your courage. That was fantastic the way you handled it, thank you. . Wow. Thank you. Great future. Thank you. Boy, I’ll tell you. Thank you very much, that’s what they’re afraid of. Did you see the other side? Did you see they have some comedian? Third rate comedian. He’s going, and he really means it. “You know he’s going to win, don’t you?” They go, “Well, maybe.” “You know he’s going to win. You know that in six years, you know it’s going to happen. He’s not leaving, you know that. He’s never going to leave, you know it. He’s not leaving.” These people are insane. He believes it. Thank you, Hunter, that was great. Great job.  You know that our movement stands for patriotism, confidence, excellence, liberty, justice, support for our military. Love for America, and loyalty to our nation and all of its people. We’re together. We all stand together for American greatness. Even at such a young age, the members of your generation are proving that our hearts and souls are all wound together, we are unbridled in our love for our country, we are truly American patriots. Remember that. Keep America great.  Right. The forces of political correctness want to silence conservative students to make you feel alone, marginalized, and isolated, and you are not. Just look around you at this incredible record setting crowd. Many, many people outside, too. I hate to tell you, I hate to tell them. They didn’t do as well, but they have a screen. It’s not as good, not quite the same, but we do the best we can. You’re not alone. The silent majority is silent no more. Your moment in the sun is just beginning. The story of America has always been written by everyday citizens who love their country so much, they could not help but speak out. That’s what happens, that’s why these three young, incredible people came up here. “Would you like to speak, Hunter?” “Yes, sir.” Most people go, “Oh, I don’t know sir. Oh maybe not.” These people, it’s like all three of them. “Ryan, you want to speak again, Ryan?” “Yes, sir, I do.”  These are great people, these are people with courage. Many of them were young, barely older than all of you. George Washington was just 21 years old when he received his first military command. Decades later, he chose a 20- year-old Alexander Hamilton to be his top aid. Betsy Ross was 24 when she began sewing the first American flag. You think about it, she’s probably more important now than she was two or three weeks ago when this stupid thing by Nike was done. They’re a tenant of mine, they pay me a lot of rent, I probably won’t see those checks anymore, but I don’t care, because I’m president. I don’t care about that.  Amelia Earhart was only 23 when she took her first flying lesson, on her way to becoming an aviation pioneer. Martin Luther King was 26 when he marched for justice through the streets of Montgomery, Alabama. General Dwight Eisenhower and General Douglas MacArthur were both in their early 20s when they graduated from West Point, never imagining they would some day save the world from tyranny. From the very beginning, America has been lifted even higher by the daring dreams of young Americans like each and every one of you.  Now it’s your turn to inspire our country, your chance to choose greatness for America, because your time has come. Your time is now. The choices you make over the next few years will shape much more than your own future. They will forever shape America’s destiny. Your choices, your leaders, your great leaders, you will be, some of you in this room will be the great leaders of our country. A couple of you may be standing essentially here someday, in a position where you can do so much. In mere months, some of you may take your first steps down a path that someday lead to discovering new breakthroughs in science, saving lives in medicine, leading a revolution in technology, upholding our values in public service, protecting our communities in law enforcement, defending our freedom in the military, or leading humanity into the stars.  As long as you are confident in your values, as long as you are loyal to our citizens, as long as you keep faith in God above, there is no limit to what you will achieve. You are the ones who are lifting our nation in the very near future. I have no doubt you will do it to soaring new heights. I have no doubt. I see the people in this room. There’s greatness in this room, there’s greatness in this room. Remember I said it. Someday you’re going to think back to this day, and you’re going to say, “You know, I remember President Trump saying there’s greatness in this room.” You’re going to be not only speaking about yourself, you’re going to be speaking about others in the room who you know are going to rise to great heights with you. You are the ones who are bringing about the incredible rebirth of the American spirit. You are the ones who will make this moment a turning point, a true historical moment. This generation, your generation, will make the light and the glory of America shine brighter, and longer, and prouder than ever before.  I want to congratulate you, you’ve had a long journey, but your journey has just begun. I want to thank you for being here. May God bless you, and may God bless America. Thank you, thank you."
"It’s a true privilege to be back in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. And, it’s a tremendous honor to stand on these historic grounds as the first President to address a joint session of the oldest lawmaking body in all of the Western Hemisphere, the Virginia General Assembly. Congratulations.  On this day 400 years ago, here on the shores of the James River, the first representative legislative assembly in the new world convened. By the devotion of generations of patriots, it has flourished throughout the ages, and now that proud tradition continues with all of you.  To every Virginian, and every legislator with us today, congratulations on four incredible centuries of history, heritage, and commitment to the righteous cause of American self-government. This is truly a momentous occasion.  I want to thank the governor of Virginia for inviting me to speak at this very important event, and with us this morning, our many distinguished guests and officials from across the Commonwealth, including Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax. Thank you very much.  Speaker, Kirk Cox. Thank you, Kirk. Thank you. Thank you, Kirk.  Senate Majority Leader, Tommy Norment. Thank you. Thank you. Tommy. Thank you.  And members of the host, and other federal, state, local and tribal leaders, all with us today. Thank you very much.  We’re also very thankful as well to have with us Secretary Ben Carson. Ben, thank you very much. Wherever you may be. Thank you, Ben.  And Acting Director, a person that you know very well, Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli. Spent a lot of time with you, folks, and has a lot of respect for you.  And the terrific people at the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. I want to thank you all for being here with us. It’s a great honor.  I also want to recognize everyone at American Evolution and the Jamestown Settlement, the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, the Jamestown Rediscovery Project and Preservation Virginia. Thank you very much. What a great job you do. Thank you.  The fact is that each of you has helped protect and preserve our national treasures here at Jamestown, and it’s a great debt. We owe you a great, great debt. Thank you. What a job.  On this day in 1619, just a mile south of where we are gathered now, 22 newly elected members of the House of Burgesses assembled in a small wooden church. They were adventurers and explorers, farmers and planters, soldiers, scholars, and clergyman.  All had struggled. All had suffered, and all had sacrificed in pursuit of one wild and very improbable dream. They called that dream, Virginia.  It had been only 13 years since three small ships, the Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery, set sail across the vast ocean. They carried 104 settlers to carve out a home on the edge of this uncharted continent.  They came from God and country. They came in search of opportunity and fortune, and they journeyed into the unknown with only meager supplies, long odds, and the power of their Christian faith.  Upon reaching Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, in 1607 a long time ago, the first men of the Virginia company erected a cross upon the shore. They gave thanks to God and asked his blessing for their great undertaking. In the months and years ahead, they would dearly need it. The dangers were unparalleled.  The Jamestown settlers arrived in America amid one of the worst droughts in over seven centuries. Of 104 original colonists, 66 died by the year’s end. During the third winter, known as the starving time, a population of up to 500 settlers was reduced to 60.  By spring, those who remained were in search of whatever they could get to survive, and they were in dire trouble. They left Jamestown deserted. They just sailed away, never to come back. But they had not gone far down the James River when they encountered the answer to their prayers, ships bearing a year’s worth of supplies, and more than 300 new settlers.  As we can see today on this great anniversary, it would not be the last time that God looked out for Virginia. Together, the settlers forged what would become the timeless traits of the American character. They worked hard. They had courage and abundance, and a wealth of self-reliance. They strived mightily to turn a profit. They experimented with producing silk, corn, tobacco, and the very first Virginia wines.  At a prior settlement at Roanoke, there had been no survivors, none at all. But where others had typically perished, the Virginians were determined to succeed. They endured by the sweat of their labor, the aid of the Powhatan Indians, and the leadership of Captain John Smith.  As the years passed, ships bearing supplies and settlers from England also brought a culture and a way of life that would define the new world. It all began here.  In time, dozens of brave, strong women made the journey and joined the colony. And in 1618, the Great Charter and other reforms, established a system based on English common law.  For the first time, Virginia allowed private land ownership. It created a basic judicial system. Finally, it gave the colonists a say in their own future, the right to elect representatives by popular vote.  With us today in tribute to that English legal inheritance is the former clerk of the British House of Commons, Sir David Natzler. Thank you, David. Thank you. Sir David, we are thrilled to have you with us. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much, David.  At that first American assembly in 1619, the weather was so hot that one legislator actually died. Mercifully, the session was cut very short. But before adjourning, the assembly passed laws on taxation, agriculture, and trade with the Indians.  With true American optimism, the assembly even endorsed a plan to build a world class university, in this still-rugged wilderness. It was a vision that would one day be fulfilled just miles from here, at one of America’s earliest educational institutions, the esteemed College of William and Mary. Great place. Great place.  As we mark the first representative legislature at Jamestown, our nation also reflects upon an anniversary from that same summer, four centuries ago. In August, 1619, the first enslaved Africans in the English colonies arrived in Virginia. It was the beginning of a barbaric trade in human lives. Today in honor, we remember every sacred soul who suffered the horrors of slavery and the anguish of bondage.  More than 150 years later, at America’s founding, our Declaration of Independence recognized the immortal truth that all men are created equal. Yet, it would ultimately take a civil war, 85 years after that document was signed, to abolish the evil of slavery.  It would take more than another century for our nation, in the words of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to live out the true meaning of its creed, and extend the blessings of freedom to all Americans.  In the face of grave oppression and grave injustice, African Americans have built, strengthened, inspired, uplifted, protected, defended, and sustained our nation from its very earliest days.  Last year, I was privileged to sign the law establishing a commission to commemorate the arrival of the first Africans to the English colonies, and the 400 years of African American history that have followed.  That was an incredible day. That was an incredible event. Today, we are grateful to be joined by that commission’s chairman, Dr. Joseph Green. Thank you, Dr. Green, please. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dr. Green.  In the decades that followed that first legislative assembly, the democratic tradition established here lay deep roots all across Virginia. It spread up and down the Atlantic coast.  One fact was quickly established for all time. In America, we are not ruled from afar. Americans govern ourselves, and so help us, God, we always will.  Right here in Virginia, your predecessors- Thank you very much, thank you.  Right here in Virginia, your predecessors came to Williamsburg from places you all know very well. They were named such as George Washington, from Fairfax County. Thomas Jefferson, from Albemarle County. James Madison, from Orange County. James Monroe, from Spotsylvania County. Patrick Henry, from Louisa County. George Mason, from Fairfax County. George With, W-I-T-H, that’s a great name, from Williamsburg. And Richard Henry Lee, from Westmoreland County. Incredible names, incredible names.  Self government in Virginia did not just give us a state we love. In a very true sense, it gave us the country we love, the United States of America. So true. Thank you very much.  When Madison drafted the First Amendment to our constitution, he drew inspiration from Virginia’s Statute for Religious Freedom. As John Adams wrote in Philadelphia, just before the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, we all look up to Virginia for examples. Great. It’s so great.  And when Patrick Henry rose to speak his famous words at St. John’s Church in Richmond, “Give me liberty or give me death,” he spoke in defense of a tradition that began more than 150 years before at Jamestown. Right here.  It was a heritage those patriots would fight a long war of independence to defend, and it is a heritage that countless Americans have fought and died for to secure in all of those centuries since. In our time, we must vigorously defend those cherished democratic traditions that have made our beloved republic the envy of the entire world. And it still is, as much as ever before, and maybe more.  Our hard-won culture of self-government must be nourished, protected, and constantly preserved. That is why we must speak out strongly against anyone who would take power away from citizens, individuals, and state governments such as yours. In America, the people will forever rule. The people will forever reign, and the people will forever be sovereign.  From the first legislative assembly down to today, America has been the story of citizens who take ownership of their future and their control of their destiny. That is what self-rule is all about, everyday Americans coming together to take action, to build, to create, to seize opportunities, to pursue the common good, and to never stop striving for greatness.  Four centuries ago, one early voyager to Jamestown captured the spirit of confidence and daring that has always powered our great experiment in self-government. He wrote, “We hope to plant a nation where none before hath stood.” That was something.  In that hope, the men and women of Jamestown achieved success beyond anything they could possibly have imagined. They started the nation that settled the wilderness, won our independence, tamed the Wild West, ended slavery, secured civil rights, invented the airplane, vanquished the Nazis, brought communism to its knees, and placed our great American flag on the face of the moon.  And in a program that’s just started, someday very soon, American astronauts will plant our beautiful stars and stripes on the surface of Mars.  But among all of America’s towering achievements, none exceeds the triumph that we are here to celebrate today. Our nation’s priceless culture of freedom, independence, equality, justice, and self-determination under God.  That culture is the source of who we are. It is our prized inheritance. It is our proudest legacy. It is among the greatest human accomplishments in the history of the world. What you have done is the greatest accomplishment in the history of the world, and I congratulate you. It started right here.  Now, we must go bravely into the future, just as those bold explorers first ventured into this majestic land. We must call upon the same scale of imagination, the same thirst for knowledge, the same love of adventure, the same unrelenting courage, and the same total determination to prevail.  Above all, we must be proud of our heritage, united in our purpose, and filled with confidence in our shared great, great, great American destiny.  For in America, no challenge is too great. No journey is too tough. No task is too large. No dream is beyond our reach. When we set our sight on the summit, nothing can stand in our way. America always gets the job done. America always wins.  That is why after 400 years of glorious American democracy, we have returned here to this place to declare to all the world that the United States of America and the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are just getting started.  Our future is bigger, bolder, better, and brighter than ever before. It’s been a great honor for me to be with you this morning. I’d like to thank you. God bless you. God bless Virginia, and God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you."
"Good morning. My fellow Americans, this morning our nation is overcome with shock, horror, and sorrow. This weekend, more than 80 people were killed or wounded in two evil attacks. On Saturday morning in El Paso, Texas, a wicked man went to a Walmart store where families were shopping with their loved ones. He shot and murdered 20 people and injured 26 others, including precious little children. Then in the early hours of Sunday morning, Dayton, Ohio, another twisted monster opened fire on a crowded downtown street. He murdered nine people, including his own sister, and injured 27 others.  The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric s s are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil, the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, and the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands, and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen. We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful, and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.  I want to thank the many law enforcement personnel who responded to these atrocities with the extraordinary grace and courage of American heroes. I have spoken with Texas governor Greg Abbott and Ohio governor Mike DeWine, as well as Mayor Dee Margo of El Paso, Texas and Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio to express our profound sadness and unfailing support. Today we also send the condolences of our nation to President Obrador of Mexico and all the people of Mexico for the loss of their citizens in the El Paso shooting. Terrible, terrible thing. I have also been in close contact with Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Wray. Federal authorities are on the ground, and I have directed them to provide any and all assistance required, whatever is needed.  The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism. Whatever they need. We must recognize that the internet has provided a dangerous avenue to radicalize disturbed minds and perform demented acts. We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The internet likewise is used for human trafficking, illegal drug distribution, and so many other heinous crimes. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored, and they will not be ignored.  In the two decades since Columbine, our nation has watched with rising horror and dread as one mass shooting has followed another, over and over again, decade after decade. We cannot allow ourselves to feel powerless. We can and will stop this evil contagion. In that task, we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people. Open wounds cannot heal if we are divided. We must seek real bipartisan solutions, we have to do that in a bipartisan manner, that will truly make America safer and better for all.  First, we must do a better job of identifying and acting on early warning signs. I am directing the Department of Justice to work in partnership with local, state, and federal agencies, as well as social media companies, to develop tools that can detect mass shooters before they strike. As an example, the monster in the Parkland High School in Florida had many red flags against him, and yet nobody took decisive action. Nobody did anything. Why not?  Second, we must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately. Cultural change is hard, but each of us can choose to build a culture that celebrates the inherent worth and dignity of every human life. That’s what we have to do.  Third, we must reform our mental health laws to better identify mentally disturbed individuals who may commit acts of violence, and make sure those people not only get treatment, but when necessary, involuntary confinement. Mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.  Fourth, we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms, and that if they do, those firearms can be taken through rapid due process. That is why I have called for red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Today, I’m also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay.  These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference. Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety, and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses.  But there is so much more that we have to do. Now is the time to set destructive partisanship aside, so destructive, and find the courage to answer hatred with unity, devotion, and love. Our future is in our control. America will rise to the challenge. We will always have, and we always will, win. The choice is ours and ours alone. It is not up to mentally ill monsters. It is up to us. If we are able to pass great legislation after all of these years, we will ensure that those who were attacked will not have died in vain.  May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo, and may God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families. May God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Merci. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Well, I want to thank you very much a-  Well, I want to thank you very much. I think more importantly than anything, I wanted to come up here to say that because the job that President Macron. and your wife by the who is a great lady, Bridget, would like to thank Bridget. She has been spectacular, spent a tremendous amount of time with Melania and some of the folks who came in, some of the wives that came in and they had a great tour of the area and it’s a beautiful area. But I want to thank you very much, Mr. President, for the incredible job you did. This is a truly successful G7.  There was tremendous unity. There was great unity. Sometimes I’d read a little bit of false reporting and I will tell you there was, in fact, we would have stayed for another hour, nobody wanted to leave. We were accomplishing a lot, but I think more importantly, we were getting along very well. Seven countries and it really was the G7 and you have been a spectacular leader on this and I want to thank you and I want to thank the great country of France. Thank you very much. That I think, excuse me, I was… Go ahead, let’s go. If you’d like, we could do two each, and then we’ll both leave the room. Would you prefer that or would you prefer… I just don’t want to have the president of France standing here while I’m answering these absolutely wonderful questions, okay? Why don’t we start with a question for France. And Emmanuel’s going to have his own press conference after this. That’ll be fine. Go ahead. To France, John, to France. No, I’m not. We’re getting, John. Just to answer that, we’re getting there. Yes. We’ll see. I do. I think they want to make the deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night, very late in the night. I see alert, or you would call it breaking news, and it was that the vice chairman, we’re not talking about somebody from China at a low level. The vice chairman of China came out that he wants to see a deal made. He wants it to be made under calm conditions. Using the word calm. I agree with him on that. And John has taken a very hard hit over the last number of months. They’ve lost a 3 million jobs, it’ll soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. The chain is breaking up like nobody’s seen before, and once that happens, it’s very hard to put it back together. You understand. I think they want, very much want to make a deal, and the longer they wait, the harder it is to put it back, if it can be put back at all.  So I believe they want to do a deal. The tariffs have hit them very hard in a fairly short period of time. The United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs. And I say it again, the reporters fail to, the media fail to acknowledge it, but if you look at the goods coming in from China, we’re talking about China, not other countries, if you look at the goods, they have a power that others don’t have, but that power is only good for so long. They’ve manipulated their currency, they’ve devalued their currency, and they put a lot of cash into the system. And because of that, the prices have not gone up or if they’ve gone up, it’s been very little because they want to keep people working. If the prices go up, they’re not going to be able to keep people working. They’re not going to be able to compete. It’s a brilliant market.  It’s a brilliant, brilliant market. The world market. A lot of markets are brilliant. And frankly, I think that China cannot, I don’t know, but maybe they can, maybe they can’t. I don’t think they can do that. And I think they’re very smart. And I think President Xi is a great leader who happens to be a brilliant man, and he can’t lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time. And that’s going to be magnified many times over, and it’s going to break down the Chinese system of trade and he can’t do that. So when you say, “Do you think they want to?” Maybe they want to and maybe they don’t, but I think they want to make a deal. I’m not sure they have a choice. And I don’t say that as a threat. I don’t think they have a choice. In the meantime, the United States, which has never collected 25 cents from China. Well, in a fairly short period of time, be over $ 100 billion in tariffs. So I think they want to make a deal very badly. Iran is a country that is not the same country that it was two and a half years ago when I came into office. Iran was the number one state of terror throughout the world. There were 18 sites of confliction in my first week. When I spoke with the folks at the Pentagon, including lots of generals and lots of other military experts, 18 sites of confliction, meaning 18 sites of big problems. Every one of them was backed by Iran or in some cases, actually using Iranian soldiers, but at a minimum Iranian wealth. Much of it given in the ridiculous deal where they were given $150 billion plus one $1.8 billion in cash. And they used that money for some bad purposes.  With that being said, I think that Iran is a country of tremendous potential. We’re not looking for leadership change, we’re not looking for that kind of change. This country has been through that many times before. That doesn’t work. We’re looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles, and a longer period of time. Very simple. We can have it done in a very short period of time. And I really believe that around can be a great nation. I’d like to see that happen, but they can’t have nuclear weapons. Okay? Thank you. Excuse me? If the circumstances were correct, were right, I would certainly agree to that. But in the meantime, they have to be good players. You understand what that means. And they can’t do what they were saying they’re going to do because if they do that, they’re going to be met with really very violent force. We have no choice. So I think they’re going to be good. I really think they’d like to. And by the way, President Macron told me every step that he was making yesterday. A lot of you said, “Oh, he came in…” He told me long before he came in what was happening, what was… I didn’t think it was appropriate to meet yesterday, too soon. And things have to be worked out first. But President Macron told me exactly what was happening, who was coming, what time they were coming, where they were going to meet. And after the meeting he told me exactly what happened. And I think he had a very positive meeting.  Prime minister, Abe of Japan, also a large purchaser of oil from Iran, he was also very much involved. Look, he knows everybody there. So he was a very, very positive force. But I have to tell you, the President’s done an excellent job and we’re going to see how it all turns out. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn’t. I say it all the time about everything. Maybe it works and maybe it doesn’t. But I’ll tell you what, we made a ridiculous deal. We gave him $150 billion, gave him $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing. And by the way, that agreement was so short term that it expires in a very short period of time.  With a country, you don’t make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don’t do short term deals, especially when you’re paying that kind of money. So I have had good feelings about Iran. I have good feelings that it’ll work. I know many Iranians living in New York City, I have many friends from Iran, they’re incredible people, incredible people. The last thing I’d like to see is a big problem, but we have to do what we have to do. Okay? Go ahead, please. No, no, no. You first. Go ahead. Oh, no. Go ahead. Yes, yes. I have to say, the JCPOA was a bad deal, should not have been entered into. A lot of things could’ve happened that would’ve been much different. They’re allowed to test ballistic missiles, you’re not allowed to go to various sites to check, and some of those sites have the most obvious sites for the creation or the making of nuclear weapons. And those things have to be changed and other things have to be changed. And I will tell you, I have very good feelings about it, i think that we’re going to do something. It may not be immediately, but I think ultimately we’re going to do something. As I said, Iran is a much different country than it was two and a half years ago, and we can get that back. And I’d encourage it. I actually had friends years ago, many years ago, they were in the real estate business and they were in Iran and they were building houses and building housing and building office buildings and apartment houses and they did very well. They made a lot of money.  And to this day, they’re not exactly the youngest developers anymore, but let me tell you, they were young when they went over. They made a lot of money and they loved the people and they loved what was going on. And it’s a country with tremendous potential. I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un, who I’ve gotten to know extremely well, First Lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she’d would agree with me, he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential. You’re in between China, Russia, and South Korea. People want to get to South Korea, they got to get there somehow, and if they’re going to do anything other than essentially fly, they want to go through. So railroads and everything else. So many things want to happen there. I think that North Korea has tremendous economic potential, and I think that Kim Jong Un sees that he would be the leader and I think he sees the tremendous potential that it’s got. With respect to Iran, same thing. Iran has incredible people and incredible country, potentially.  Location, that’s a little rough neighborhood, but eventually it’s going to be a beautiful neighborhood. I think that it’s going to work out. And I really believe that those countries that went into the original deal, that more and more are agreeing with what I did. But I think those countries are going to be saying, “Thank you,” someday. I hope they’re going to be saying it, including France, including the President, because I think we did the right thing. I know we did the right thing if for no other reason, it’s just too short. It’s almost expiring, if you think about it. And somebody said, “Well, you’ll go and make an extension.” No, no. They’re great negotiators. Look at what they did to get the deal. Look at what they did to John Kerry and to President Obama. Look what happened when they’re bringing plane loads of cash. Plane loads, big planes, 757s, Boeing 757s, coming into loaded up with cash.  What kind of a deal is that? I think a lot of good things are going to happen, and I just want to say this because I’ve spoken a lot with the President this last two and a half days. We’ve never had a better relationship. We had a lunch that lasted for quite a while, that many of you got to see, it was the two of us, no staff, no anything. He wasn’t trying to impress his people, i wasn’t trying to impress his people. We were just trying to impress each other. And I’ll tell you what, it was the best period of time we’ve ever had, and we accomplished a lot. I don’t mean just, “Gee whiz, wasn’t that nice?” He’s a very capable man. He’s doing a great job for France. He did an incredible job for the G7 and I just want to thank you and you go ahead to your news conference, and very special. This was a very special, a very unified, two and a half days. And I want to thank you for it. Thank you. I can confirm that the First Lady loved your French wine. Okay? All right? She loved your French wine. So thank you very much. That’s fine. Thank you. Thank you. Good job.  She’s worse than you are. I can’t believe it. Jonathon. Billions and billions coming in and I think we’re going to get there. I do. I believe it more strongly now than I would have believed that a while ago. We’re going to get there and we’re going to have a really… We’ll have a fair deal. But remember this, when you say fair, China’s been taking out of this country, $500 plus billion dollars a year for many, many years. Many, many years. It was time to stop. As a private person, i used to talk about it. It’s one of the reasons I’m President. And we’re in a great position, our country’s doing well. Our unemployment numbers are the lowest they’ve been in over 50 years.  Our unemployment numbers for African-American, Asian, for Hispanic, are the best they’ve ever been, historic numbers. We’re in a very strong position. Our consumers are strong. Walmart just announced numbers that were, I mean, mind boggling numbers. It’s a great poll right there. That’s the ultimate pole. How are the retailers doing and how are certain certain companies doing? So we’re doing very well, and I think that I think we’re going to make a deal with China, and I think we’ll probably, eventually, we’re going to make a deal with Iran too. It’s not a question of behavior. I think they want to make a deal and I think they should make a deal and I think if they don’t make a deal it’s going to be very bad for China. And I very much appreciate the fact that they came out last night, very late last night, and they said they want to make a deal, they want it to be under calm circumstances. It was a little different kind of a statement. I thought it was a beautiful statement. I thought it indicated a lot. Go ahead. Here we go. One question, go ahead. No, no, no. One question. Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ve spent, and I think I will in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably it’ll cost me anywhere from $ 3 to $5 billion to be President. And-  Three to $5 billion to be president. And the only thing I care about is this country. Couldn’t care less, otherwise I wouldn’t have done it. People have asked me, “What do you think it costs?” And between opportunity, not doing thing … I used to get a lot of money to make speeches. Now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo, and that’s good. And I did a lot of great jobs and great deals that I don’t do anymore. I don’t want to do them because the deals I’m making are great deals for the country. And that’s, to me, much more important.  Doral happens to be within Miami. It’s a city, it’s a wonderful place. It’s a very, very successful area of Florida. It’s very importantly, only five minutes from the airport. The airport’s right next to it. It’s a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world. Everybody that’s coming, all of these people with all of their big entourages come. It’s set up so … And by the way, my people looked at 12 sites, all good. But some were two hours from an airport, some were four hours, I mean, they were so far away. Some didn’t allow this, or they didn’t allow that. With Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings, we call them bungalows. They each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants, it’s such a natural. We wouldn’t even have to do the work that they did here. And they’ve done a beautiful job. They’ve really done a beautiful job.  And what we have also is Miami. And we have many hundreds of acres, so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need. The ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida and the best. It’s brand new and my people wanted it. From my standpoint, I’m not going to make any money. In my opinion, I’m not going to make any money. I don’t want to make money. I don’t care about making money. If I want to make money, I wouldn’t worry about 3 billion to 5 billion, because that’s what … I mean, at some point I’m going to detail that and we’ll show, but I think it’s just a great place to be. I think having it in Miami is fantastic, really fantastic. Having it at that particular place because of the way it’s set up, each country can have their own villa or their own bungalow, and the bungalows, when I say they have a lot of units in them, so I think it just works out well.  And when my people came back, they took tours. They went to different places. I won’t mention places, but you’ll have a list because they’re going to give a presentation on it fairly soon. They went to places all over the country and they came back and they said, “This is where we’d like to be.” Now, we had military people doing it. We had Secret Service people doing it. We had people that really understand what it’s about. It’s not about me, it’s about getting the right location. I think it’s very important.  Jonathan. No, not at all. Go ahead, Jonathan. It does. Well, it does. I don’t know the gentleman. I think that I know him a little bit just by watching over the last number of years what’s happened. Tell you one thing, he’s a great negotiator, but he … I think he’s going to want to meet. I think Iran wants to get this situation straightened out. Now, is that based on fact or based on gut? That’s based on gut. If they want to get this situation straightened out, Jonathan, and they’re really hurting badly. Their inflation, as you know, because they saw you reporting on it, their inflation is through the roof. Their economy has tanked entirely. The sanctions are absolutely hurting them horribly. I don’t want to see that. I don’t want to see that. They’re great people. I don’t want to see that. But we can’t let them have a nuclear weapon. Can’t let it happen. So I think that there’s a really good chance that we would meet. Jeff, please. No. No. What he’s talking in terms of compensation is they are out of money and they may need a short term letter of credit or loan. No, we’re not paying. We don’t pay, but they may need some money to get them over a very rough patch. And if they do need money, certainly. And it would be secured by the oil, which to me is great security and they have a lot of oil, but it’s secured by oil. So we’re really talking about a letter of credit type facility. It would be from numerous countries, in numerous countries. And it comes back. It would expire. It would be paid back immediately and very quickly. Yes, go ahead please. Go ahead. Yes. Just left. Your prime minister, Abe, good man. Great man. And for Japan, I would say. Both. Not at this moment, no. Not at this moment. Well, it’s one of the reasons we made the deal, but no, not at this moment. It’s something I could do at a later date if I wanted to, but we’re not looking at that. We just want to be treated fairly. Japan has had a tremendous trade surplus with the United States for many, many years, long before I came here. And I’ll tell you something, we’re transforming our country. We’re taking these horrible, one-sided, foolish, very dumb, stupid, if you’d like to use that word because it’s so descriptive. We’re taking these trade deals that are so bad and we’re making good, solid deals out of them. And that’s transforming our country. That will be transformative and very exciting, I think, for our country. Very, very exciting. Please, go ahead. Well, I didn’t actually say you. I said the woman behind you, so why don’t we do her first. You’ve been asking a lot of questions all day long. Don’t say I don’t give you access, right? Go ahead. I don’t care politically. I really don’t. A lot of people don’t understand this. I ran one election and I won, happened to be for president. I don’t care politically. I’m going to run another election. I think I’m winning based on polls that we see. Whether I win or not, I have to do the right thing. So I don’t do things for political reasons. Is it good? Probably not. Maybe it is. I mean, a lot of people are smart. A lot of people say having Russia, which is a power, having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G7 that felt that way. And we didn’t take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it. My inclination is to say yes, they should be in.  They were really … It was a President Obama … I’m not blaming him, but a lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama. One of the things that happened was, as you know, what happened in with a very big area, a very, very big and important area in the Middle East where the red line was drawn and then President Obama decided that he was not going to do anything about it. You can’t draw red lines in the sand. You just can’t do it. And the other was in Ukraine having to do with a certain section of Ukraine that you know very well where it was sort of taken away from President Obama. Not taken away from President Trump, taken away from President Obama.  President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him. Right. It was very embarrassing to him and he wanted Russia to be out of the, what was called the G8, and that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama. And I can understand how President Obama would feel. He wasn’t happy, and they’re not in for that reason.  Now, I’m only thinking about the world and I’m thinking about this country in terms of the G7, whether it’s G7, G8. I think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent. Do we live by the way? Yes, we live by the way. Is it politically popular for me to say that? Possibly not. I think a lot of people would agree with me, frankly, but possibly not. I do nothing for politics and a lot of you, you’re going to smile at that. I do nothing for politics. I do what’s right and people like what I do, but I just do what’s right. If I wanted to go strictly by politics, I’d probably poll that and possibly I’d say, “Oh gee, I don’t want Russia in,” but I really think it’s good for security of the world, it’s good for the economics of the world.  Remember they’re building a big pipeline in Europe going right up to Germany. And I said to Angela, who I had a great relationship, but I said, “You pay Russia billions of dollars and then we defend you from Russia.” And I say, “How does that work?” Well, he did. Well, it was annexed during President, I know you like President Obama, but it was annexed during President Obama’s term. If it was annexed during my term, I’d say, “Sorry folks, I made a mistake, or sorry folks.” President Obama was helping Ukraine. Crimea was annexed during his term. Now, it’s a very big area, very important area. Russia has its submarine, that’s where they do their submarine work and that’s where they dock large and powerful submarines, but not as powerful as ours and not as large as ours, but they have their submarines and President Obama was pure and simply outsmarted. They took Crimea during his term. That was not a good thing. It could have been stopped, could’ve been stopped with the right whatever. It could have been stopped, but President Obama was unable to stop it and it’s too bad. Go ahead. Well, I don’t know that he’d accept. And those are tough circumstances. He was a part of G8, and all of a sudden, he’s not out or he’s not in. So I think, John, actually, that’s a pretty tough thing for him. He’s a proud person. Would I invite him? I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come, psychologically, I think that’s a tough thing for him to do. You have a G8, now it’s a G7 and you invite the person that was thrown out, really by President Obama and really because he got outsmarted, President Obama, pure and simple. And don’t forget, it was not just Crimea, it was the red line in the sand and Obama said never violate the red line in the sand. And then they went ahead and they killed many children with gas. It was terrible and he did nothing about it. I did, but I was there years later. I did something about it, but I was there late. . Go ahead. Well, we’ve had many calls. Secretary Mnuchin is here and you’ve had many calls over the last 24 hours. But certainly over the last 48 hours we’ve had many calls, not just one. This isn’t one. And these are high level calls. They want to make a deal, and by the way, I think a deal is going to be made, but they want to make a deal. The Chinese are not saying that. Excuse me. Let me respond to something. The vice chairman of China, do you get higher than that other than President Xi? The vice president, the vice chairman, it’s not the vice president. The vice chairman made the statement that he wants to make a deal, that he wants to see a call made, mister, he wants it all to happen. That says it there. I don’t have to talk about … You folks were reporting before what we can’t find any phone call. He released the statement. I didn’t release it. He released the statement. Numerous calls. And not only with Steve, there were calls with other people too. Just so you understand, China wants to make a deal. Now, whether or not we make a deal, it’s got to be a great deal. And I tell this to President Xi, who I really respect. I really do. I have great respect and I like him too. He’s a tough guy, but I have a lot of feelings for President Xi. He’s very outstanding in so many ways, but I told him very strongly, I said, “Look. You’re starting up here and you’re making 500 billion a year and stealing our intellectual property. We’re down on the floor, lower than the floor. Can’t make a 50 50 deal. This has to be a deal that’s better for us. And if it’s not better, let’s not do business together. I don’t want to do business. Forget about tariffs for a second. We’re taking in tremendous amounts of money. Forget that. I don’t want to do business.”  Now, when I raise and he raises, I raise and he raises, we can never catch up. We have to balance our trading relationship, at least to an extent. And they were unwilling to do that. And we’ll never have a deal if that happens, but it’s going to happen because they have to have a deal. And as far as phone calls are concerned, Secretary of the Treasury and other people have been receiving many calls, not receiving, back and forth, many calls. China wants to make a deal. And if we can, we will make a deal. We’ll see. . Go ahead. You’re talking about global economic instability? I don’t consider instability, but that- Sorry. It’s the way I negotiate. It’s the way I negotiate. It’s done very well for me over the years and it’s doing even better for the country, I think. And I do think that … Look. Here’s the story. I hear people say, “Oh, just make a deal, make a deal.” They don’t have the guts and they don’t have the wisdom to know that you can’t continue to go on where a country is taking 500 billion, not million, 500 billion with a B, out every single year, $500 billion. You just can’t do that. Somebody had to do this. This should have been done by President Obama. It should have been done and Biden, sleepy Joe. It should have been done by other people. It should’ve been done by Bush, it should’ve been done by Clinton, double Bush. It should’ve been done. I’m doing it. Let me tell you something else. North Korea should’ve been done a long time ago. I’m doing it. I’m doing a lot of things that I shouldn’t have to be doing. . Please. Go ahead, please. I believe that. Well, Theresa was unable to do the deal. I gave her my ideas as to doing the deal very early on, and you possibly know what they are, but I would have done that. She chose to do it her way and that didn’t work out so well. I think she’s a very, very good person and a good woman and I really believe that Boris Johnson will be a great prime minister. We like each other and we had a great two and a half days. I’ve been waiting for him to be prime minister for about six years. I told him, “What took you so long?” I think he’s going to be a great prime minister and especially after spending a lot of intense time with him over the last couple of days. He’s very smart, he’s very strong, and he’s very enthusiastic, and you know what else? He loves your country. He really loves your country. That came out maybe more than anything else yet. Yeah, please. No, no, no. I love the UK. I own great property in the UK. I love the UK. I have no idea how my property is doing because I don’t care. But I own Turnberry and I own in Aberdeen and I own in Ireland, as you know, Doonbeg and great stuff. And I’ll be honest with you, I think he’s going to just do a great job as prime minister. It takes a lot. It’s so many different elements to being a great prime minister and you needed him. I just think his time is right. This is the right time for Boris. This is the right time for Boris. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Go ahead. Right here. Say who you’re with, please. I think we’re going to have just a … Look, France is a great nation. It’s being run, a lot of things that are happening, it’s not easy what he’s doing, he’s changing certain ways. It’s a very hard thing to do. I won’t get into it. I’m going to let him sell his ideas, but a lot of people don’t disagree with his ideas, but it’s a very hard thing to do. If you’re a great citizen of France, you love your country, but you want to do the way you’ve been doing it for a long time, but maybe that’s not working and maybe they have to do what he has to do. I think he’s going to do a fantastic job, but it’s very tough for him. I know how tough it is for him. He’s been having a hard time and nobody would have an easy time, but I do believe he’s doing the right thing and Boris is different.  It’s a different kind of a deal. Boris has to try and do something with Brexit. It’s very tough. I deal with the EU. The EU is … That’s a very, very strong group of people. They have their ideas and they’re not easy to deal with, I will tell you.  We’re very close to making a deal, by the way, with the EU. I have to say this. We made a great deal with Japan and we’re very close to maybe making a deal with the EU because they don’t want tariffs. It’s very simple. They don’t want to tax cars. Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don’t need a 20% or 25% tax. But we’re very close. I think we’re going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not. We’re going to have a deal, a really fair deal, but the EU is another one. We’ve been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That’s a lot of money. How much can you take out of the piggy bank? Right. Both. I don’t want to say which. Look, I think we have been with, I guess you would start off by saying England. I asked Boris, “Where’s England? What’s happening with England?” They don’t use it too much anymore. We talked about it. It was very interesting, but the United Kingdom is a great, incredible place. It’s an incredible nation and it’s been one of our tremendous allies. And another one happens to be Australia. He was here also, Scott. He is fantastic. In fact, we’re honoring him in Australia at the White House in a very short period of time. But I think that … Excuse me? At some point I will, yeah. At some point I will. Also Germany, Angela asked me to visit Germany. We’re going to be doing that too. So I just think they’re very different and they’re going to be going at it for a little while, but ultimately, probably works out. They may have to get out. They may not make a deal. The European Union is very tough to make deals with. Very, very tough. Just to ask Theresa May.  Go ahead. I understand that. Well, we actually had a very good meeting. I headed out with one or two people where we disagreed in terms of concept, but we actually had a pretty good meeting last year. I would say that this was a big step above in terms of unity, in terms of agreement. We have really great agreement on a lot of very important subjects, but last year was good also. I mean, last year was good also. I think last year might’ve been a little bit underrated. Go ahead, please. Oh, we’re going to do something hopefully special. We’re going to build on what we have now. We built on something really good and we’re going to be going in with some great unity. We really did. If there was any word for this particular meeting of seven very important countries, it was unity. I think most important of all, we got along great. We got along good.  Go ahead. Oh, I didn’t say it, he did. Yeah. Yes. That was an easy answer. Absolutely. Great respect for China. Great respect for the leadership of China. Absolutely. I haven’t said that, but I think that having President Putin in what was the G8. He was a member of the G8 and I heard he was a good member of the G8. Having him in I think is more of an advantage. I think it’s a positive for the world. I think it’s a positive for Russia. I think it’s a big positive for Russia and it’s something the group is discussing. They are discussing it. People feel very much like me. Many people. Why? Well, we’ll see. I know one thing, if they were invited back, I think they’d be there. If they weren’t, that’s okay too. I just think they’d be better inside than outside. I mean, as I said before, I really do. I think they’d be an asset. I think it would be a good thing. Some of the things we’re going in the room, and yesterday particularly, we were discussing four or five matters, and Russia was literally involved in all of those four or five matters, and a few of the people looked up and said, “Why aren’t they here talking to us about it? And what are we going to do now? Go home, take it easy for a day?” Although I’m not doing that, I don’t take it easy, but, “What do we do? We’re going to go home and start calling them at the end of the week and say, ‘Hey, how about this?’ It could have been in the room.”  We had numerous things that we were discussing, right? Numerous. We had a lot of things that we were discussing and it would’ve been very easy if Russia was in the room. If he was in the room, we could’ve solved those things. Now they’re just in limbo, but I have to say with all of that, very little, little limbo, but somebody will speak to them about some things and, frankly, they’re not very complicated, but it would be easier if they were in the room picking stones. Okay. Josh, go ahead. Josh. I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I’ve made that wealth come alive. We will soon be one of the … We will soon be exporting. In fact, we’re actually doing it now, exporting, but we are now the number one energy producer in the world, and soon it will be by far with a couple of pipelines that have not been able to get approved for many, many years. It’ll have a huge impact. I was able to get An war in Alaska, could be the largest site in the world for oil and gas. I was able to get An war approved. Ronald Reagan wasn’t able to do it. Nobody was able to do that. They’ve been trying to do it since before Ronald Reagan. I got it approved. We’re the number one energy producer in world. Soon it will be by far the number one. It’s tremendous wealth, and LNG is being sought after all over Europe and all over the world. And we have more of it than anybody else.  And I’m not going to lose that wealth. I’m not going to lose it on dreams, on windmills, which frankly aren’t working too well. I’m not going to lose it. So Josh, in a nutshell, I want the cleanest water on Earth. I want the cleanest air on Earth. And that’s what we’re doing. And I’m an environmentalist. A lot of people don’t understand that. I have done more environmental impact statements, probably, than anybody. I guess I can say definitely because I’ve done many, many, many of them, more than anybody that’s ever been president or vice president or anything even close to president. And I think I know more about the environment than most people. I want clean air. I want clean water. I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with a jobs, with pensions, with so many things, and that’s what we’re getting.  So I want to be very careful. At the same time, at the same time, at the same time … You weren’t called. At the same time, it’s very important to me, very important to me. We have to maintain this incredible place that we’ve all built. We become a much richer country, and that’s a good thing. Not a bad thing, because that great wealth allows us to take care of people. We can take care of people that we couldn’t have taken care of in the past because of the great wealth. We can’t let that wealth be taken away. Clean air, clean water.  Thank you very much everybody. I appreciate it, thank you. ."
"Get along with people in the administration that I consider very important. And I hope we’ve left in good stead, but maybe we have, and maybe we haven’t. I have to run the country the way we’re running the country. We’re doing very well. We’re respected all over the world again. Respected like we haven’t been respected in many, many years. You look at Iran, and you look at so many of the things that are happening. Iran wants to talk. They all want to talk. We’re doing very well with China, and you probably saw the numbers that have come out and come out, some of them coming out just today, but China’s, their supply chain is breaking up, the supply chain of China, which was this unbreakable powerful tool that they had, is breaking up like a toy, because companies are moving out, and China wants to make a deal. We’ll see what happens. We have to make the right deal for this country.  China has been taking out hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of our country, and you know, I read papers like the Wall Street Journal. They don’t have a clue, they haven’t got a clue. They don’t make any excuses for the fact that China has been literally ripping off the United States in the worst manner for so many years, 500 billion dollars pouring out of the United States. And I hear people, I don’t even know, do these people have any education on anything? It’s common sense maybe more than anything else. But I look at some statements that are made from so many different people, and you know, John wasn’t in line with what we were doing, and actually in some cases he thought it was too tough what we were doing. Mr tough guy, you know, you have to go into Iraq.  Going into Iraq was something that he felt very strongly about. So we’re right now in for over 7 trillion dollars into the Middle East. And I don’t say it was his decision. You had a president, and you had other people also, but he was very out there, I can tell you, and wanting to have them do it. And I disagreed with that decision from the beginning, even though I was a civilian, so nobody cared. But I was out there. I was outspoken about it. I thought it was a terrible mistake. Here we are, many, many years later, decades later, and we’re still there, and we’ve been acting as policemen. And I’ll tell you one thing, we are hitting the Taliban right now harder than they’ve ever been hit. And what they did was horrible, when they killed a great American soldier, when they killed 12 people, innocent people, essentially innocent people. Because if you look, I mean many of these people were civilians. You also had a NATO soldier, in addition to our great soldier.  But what they did what they did in order to create what they thought was a better negotiating stance, I said, “That’s the end of them. Get them out. I don’t want anything to do with them.” And they’ve been hit very hard. And I know for a fact they said that was a big mistake that they made, and it was. But that was my decision. And what we’re doing now is my decision. So we have a lot of great people that want that position. A lot of great people want a lot of positions. They want to be a part of this administration. We’ve done more in this administration, in less than three years, then I believe any president, you look at the accomplishments, even today, what we’re doing, you look at what we’re doing today, these are big things. Nobody else would be doing this. They’re big things.  But we’ve done more than any administration probably in the history of the country. You just look at one point after another point, whether it’s regulation cuts, whether it’s tax cuts, you look at Right To Try, with these two gentlemen, so important, Right To Try, where people are able to use some of the incredible innovations that we’ve developed with the greatest labs, and the greatest doctors in the world, and they could use them instead of being forced to move and leave to other countries that don’t have a clue compared to us. And now they have Right To Try. And by the way, a lot of people are being saved, a lot of great things are happening with Right To Try. But what we’ve done for the vets, what we’ve done for our great military, with spending 700 this year, 718 billion dollars. And by the way, that’s also jobs. Secondarily, but it’s also jobs. Nobody’s done what we’ve done, and we’re very honored to have done it. We’re in a very good footing. Our country is respected again. Well I have five people that want it very much. I mean a lot more than that would like to have it, but there are five people that I consider very highly qualified, good people I’ve gotten to know, over the last three years, and we’ll be announcing somebody next week, but we have some very highly qualified people. But we were set back very badly when John Bolton talked about the Libyan model, and he made a mistake. And as soon as he mentioned that, the Libyan model, what a disaster. Take a look at what happened to Kadafi with the Libyan model, and he’s using that to make a deal with North Korea?  And I don’t blame Kim Jong-Un for what he said after that, and he wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. And that’s not a question of being tough. That’s a question of being not smart, to say something like that. So I wish John the best. We actually got along very well. I’m sure he’ll, you know, do whatever he can do to spin it his way. John came to see me the night before. In fact, I think a lot of you people were out there waiting for me to get on the helicopter. I’m sure you have a shot somewhere along the line. And he sat right in that chair. And I told him, “John, if too many people, you’re not getting along with people. And a lot of us including me, disagree with some of your tactics, and some of your ideas. And I wish you well, but I’d like you to submit your resignation.” And he did that. And I really, I know he’s going to do well. I hope he’s going to do well, and I wish him well. So I just spoke with Senator Toomey, and Senator Murphy, and Joe Manchin, Senator Joe Manchin. Just had a long talk with them just before this meeting, just hung up, and we are working very, very hard together, all of us, and we’ll see that we can come up with something that’s acceptable to everybody. It’s a subject that’s been going on for decades. Decades they’ve been talking about it, so we’re looking at background checks, and we’re looking at putting everything together in a unified way so that we can have something that’s meaningful. At the same time, all of us want to protect our great second amendment, it’s very important to all of us. So we are now in meetings. The meetings are going to go on tonight. I’m going to speak with them again tomorrow, and I think progress is being made. I hope so. We’re going to take a look at a lot of different things, and we’ll be reporting back in a fairly short period of time. There are a lot of things under discussion. Some things will never happen, and some things can really very much, some very meaningful things can happen. It’s really a gun sense, if you think about it. What we’re looking at is, and maybe that’s what we should go with, the gun sense bill, but we will have some, we’re having great dialogue. We’ll see what happens. No, I never did that. I never did that. That’s a whole hoax by the fake news media when they talk about the hurricane, and when they talk about Florida, and they talk about Alabama. That’s just fake news. Right from the beginning, it was a fake story. And while we’re here, and while we’re talking about that, I want to congratulate Dan Bishop last night on an incredible win, Dan was 17 points behind three weeks ago, the media thought he was going to lose. They were all set to have a big celebration with their partners from the Democrat party.  And Dan Bishop worked really hard, and I worked very hard with him, and he made up a 17 point lead in a few weeks, and he won a great election last night. And also Greg Murphy, which nobody’s even reporting, but Greg Murphy won a great congressional election in North Carolina last night, and I want to congratulate, between Dan and Greg, what a job they did. We pick up two seats and Greg was anticipated to win by two or three points, maybe less, but two or three points. And he won by many, many points. I don’t know what the final tab is, but he won by a lot, and he campaigned brilliantly, and Dan campaign brilliantly. And so we’re very happy about that. That’s a tremendous win for the Republican party. Okay. Yeah go ahead. Well, we have a policy on Venezuela that’s a firm policy, Venezuela’s really hurting, and we’re trying to help people in a humanitarian way. That’s probably not good in terms of, you know, crushing a terrible regime. But yeah, people dying, this a country that 15 years ago was one of the wealthiest countries, and now it’s died. They don’t have water, they don’t have food, they don’t have medical, they have nothing. So we’re trying to help as much as we can. We’re also working with Columbia, and their leader of Columbia is a friend of mine, and he’s doing a really good job, I can tell you that.  We’re working with Columbia, we’re working with Brazil, we’re working with other countries on a humanitarian basis. Venezuela is in very sad shape, that shows you about socialism. I mean that shows you what happens. You take a country that was so wealthy 15 years ago, and today they don’t have water, and they don’t have basic food. So we’ll see what happens. No, I disagreed with John Bolton on his attitudes on Venezuela. I thought he was way out of line, and I think I’m proven to be right. But we are always watching Venezuela very, very closely. I don’t want to talk about that. Well, they become very rich companies very fast, and the whole thing with vaping is a, is, it’s been very profitable, and I want companies. Look, you know that, I fight for our companies very hard. I fight, that’s why I’m fighting with China. That’s why I’m fighting with other countries. If you look at European union, and if you look at Japan, and if you look at so many others, including South Korea, and many others, we’re constantly dealing with them to make it good for our companies, because I view it as jobs. I view it as income for our country, and jobs. Vaping has become a very big business, as I understand it, a giant business in a very short period of time. But we can’t allow people to get sick, and we can’t have our youth be so effected. And I’m hearing it, and that’s how the First Lady got involved, and she’s got a son together that is a beautiful young man, and she feels very, very strongly about it. She’s seen it. We’re both reading it. A lot of people are reading it, but people are dying with vaping.  So we’re looking at it very closely. And you know, if nothing else, this is a conference that’s going to let people know about it. Because people are going to watch what we’re saying. And parents are going to be a lot tougher with respect to their children. A lot of people think vaping is wonderful, it’s great. It’s really not wonderful. That’s one thing I think we can say definitely, commissioner, it’s not a wonderful thing. It’s got big problems. We have to find out the extent of the problem. It’s so new, it’s so new. But we’re going to find out, and I hope that parents, they have children and the children are a certain age, I hope they going to be able to make wise decisions. Maybe based on what we’re saying today. But the commissioner and Alex Azar, they’re going to be coming back over the next pretty short period of time, couple of weeks with some very strong recommendations. I’m not looking at anything. Iran is a different country than it was two and a half years ago. Two and a half years ago, they were given a lot of money by President Obama previous to that. 150 billion dollars, 1.8 billion in cash, in actual cash. It’s very impressive. But they are a much different country right now than they were two and a half years ago when I came into office. And I do believe they’d like to make a deal. If they do, that’s great. And if they don’t, that’s great too, but they have tremendous financial difficulty, and the sanctions are getting tougher and tougher. We cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon, and they never will have a nuclear weapon. And if they’re thinking about enrichment, they can forget about it. Because it’s to going be very dangerous for them to enrich. Very, very dangerous. Okay? You can spread the word to Iran. We’ll see what happens. We’ll see what happens. I think Iran has potential, and I think North Korea, those are two countries we’re dealing with right now at a very high level. I think Iran has a tremendous, tremendous potential. They’re incredible people. We’re not looking for regime change. We hope that we can make a deal, and if we can’t make a deal, that’s fine too. Okay. That’s fine too. But I think they have to make a deal. They’ve never been in this condition. By the way, China is having the worst year they’ve had now in 57 years, okay? 57. There was 27, there was 22, and then 27, it’s 57 years, it’s the worst year they’ve had. And it’s only going to get worse. So I think they want to make a deal too. We’re dealing with them, but I think they’ll want to make a deal. As you know, they’re coming in, sometime in early October and we’re speaking to them constantly.  And they also, they made a couple of moves last night that were pretty good. You saw that right? They were pretty good. They were pretty respectful to our people. You’re going to see it because you we’re one of the people that reported it, your group. But China is, it’s about having to do with tariffs, you saw what they did, they took tariffs off certain things. A lot of things. I think they did the right thing. I think it was good for them, but they took them off. Yeah, I think it was a, I think it was a gesture. But it was a big move. People were shocked. I wasn’t shocked, but I deal with them, and I know them, and I like them and I hope we can do something. And with respect to Iran, I think they have to do something, because they have potential to have an unbelievably great country. But the way it’s going right now, it’s disintegrating, and I don’t think they should allow that to happen. North Korea has tremendous potential. North Korea is in between Russia, China, and South Korea. It’s an incredible, incredible people. I think that they really will, they have this truly unbelievable potential, and I think they want to get to it. We’ll see what happens. I mean, maybe they do and maybe then it won’t. I mean, you’re just going to just see. But I really believe that North Korea would like to see something tremendous happen.  This could be one of the most unbelievable, you look at a country in terms of upside, this could be one of the most unbelievable experiments ever, North Korea. And I also say the same with Iran. Iran can get back to business. They can do unbelievably well with all of the natural things that play in. So on vaping, just to finish, this is all about vaping. This is a meeting that gets off a little track because you ask us questions about other things, and I think we’re better of answering them than not, but we are looking at vaping very strongly. It’s very dangerous. Children have died, people have died. And the acting commissioner is somebody that’s a true expert on it. As much as you can be an expert on a brand new subject, and we’re going to have some very strong rules, regulations, and more importantly, I think we’re going to have some very important information come out very shortly. And we’ll be reporting that over the next couple of weeks. And I want to thank you and commissioner, I want to thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Well, thank you all for being here. We’ve had a tremendous three days in New York at the United Nations. I want to thank the Secretary-General. It’s been really incredible what’s been taking place, and he’s been a fantastic host to a lot of countries. The meetings I had on a bilat or close were pretty staggering. I think we set a new record, but you’ll have to check that out. We met very, very … for pretty extended periods of time, either two-on-two, one-on-one, or just about at that level with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Other than that, we weren’t too busy over the last three days. And unfortunately, the press doesn’t even cover it. We’ve made some fantastic deals, like with Japan for farmers. We have a tremendous trade deal with Japan, and that doesn’t get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.  The PMI manufacturers’ index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible … Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be, Larry, please stand up. He just gave me these numbers. And existing new home sales are through the roof, just came out. Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they’ve gone down very substantially, so we have plenty of oil. But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry, and the extent of the increase. Is that a correct statement? So thank you, Larry Kudlow. We think we’ll make this little announcement to you because important. The so-called whistleblower, the one that didn’t have any first-class or first-rate or second-tier information from what I understand, you’ll have to figure that out for yourself. But I’ve spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans, many of them, and we were going to do this anyway, but I’ve informed them, all of the House members, that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly secondhand information, which is sort of interesting. And other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting.  But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China. Millions of dollars, millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was vice president. And I think they should have transparency for that, and I’ve informed the Leader about that.  And additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new president, who I met and is an outstanding person, I just met a little while ago, some of you were there. I think it’s going to be outstanding. He got elected on the basis of corruption. He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that’s great. But they went there, and they wanted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn’t do things.  Now, that’s what they’re accusing me of, but I didn’t do it. I didn’t threaten anybody. In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine, and he said, “No pressure.” I used the word pressure. I think he used the word push, but he meant pressure. But it’s the same thing. No push, no pressure, no nothing. It’s all a hoax, folks. It’s all a big hoax. And the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries and … I mean, really hard. This has been … I’ve been up from early in the morning to late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country, and the press doesn’t even cover all of this. And it’s really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us. So we want transparency. We’ve informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency, and we said vote for it. So I think you’ll have close to 100% of the Republican votes, I hope. And they got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine’s Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical. In the letter, they implied that their support for US assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn’t do the right thing, they wouldn’t get any assistance. Gee, doesn’t that sound familiar? Doesn’t that sound familiar?  And Chris Murphy, who I’ve been dealing with on guns, so nice. He’s always, “Oh, no, we want to work it out. We want to work it out.” But they’re too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt. So Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that if he doesn’t do things right, they won’t have Democrat support in Congress. You can look all of this up.  One other thing, I’m just going off certain notes and elements of what we’ve been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago. The Amazon Washington Post just put out a fake article that Acting Director Of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who I’ve gotten to know, and he’s a tough cookie, and I was surprised, I was shocked to hear this, was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn’t let him talk openly, freely. And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he’s tough. Tough guy. And I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit.  Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement. I didn’t speak to Joe yet, but he said, “At no time have I considered resigning my position.” In other words, the story in The Washington Post was a fake. “At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16th, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I’m committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.” That’s from the Acting Director Of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.  So we’re having a great period of time. Our country’s the strongest it’s ever been economically, our numbers are phenomenal. Wilbur, thank you, and Larry, everybody. The numbers are phenomenal. Our economy is the strongest in the world. We’re the largest economy in the world. Had my opponent won, we would be second right now because China was catching us so rapidly we would have been second by this time. And unless somebody does a very poor job as president, we’re going to be first for a long way because we’ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars and millions of jobs and their supply chain. And they want to make a deal.  This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before. Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we’ve ever had. You know you’ve heard me say it many times, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had. And the most and best employment numbers. 160 million, very close to that number, in jobs. We’ve never been anywhere close.  Wages are up, and inequality is down. Something that people don’t like writing about, but wages are up. I used to speak during the campaign, and I talk about wages where people were making less money three years ago than they were making 21 years ago, 22 years ago, and they’d have two jobs and three jobs. So when I say three years ago, I’m talking into the area sometime prior to the election. And they were doing very badly. And now for the first time in many years, wages are up, and employment is up, and unemployment is down. And it’s a beautiful thing to watch.  In a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships. We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.  I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson at length, the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent new bilateral trade deal. So we’ll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we’ll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years, over the last 20 years, frankly. It should be a much bigger deal. That’s true with many countries. We’re going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have a opportunity to come, and they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.  Earlier today I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan, friend of mine, a great gentleman, had a great reelection. And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers and technology. The technology companies are really big beneficiaries. We also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India, and many other nations on achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade. And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir and whatever help I can be. I offered, whether it’s arbitration or mediation or whatever it has to be, I’ll do whatever I can because they’re at very serious odds right now, and hopefully that’ll get better. You look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries, two good friends of mine. I said, “Fellows, work it out. Just work it out.” Those are two nuclear countries. They’ve got to work it out.  This week, we also made incredible strides on national security with President Duda of Poland. We signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation. And crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100% of the money, something I don’t think you’ve ever heard said before, but they’re going to put up 100% of the money of hosting additional US military personnel that we’ll be taking from various other countries. We won’t have more over, we’ll be moving them around. Poland is building us phenomenal new facilities. They’re spending everything, and they’re going to really do a job, but we’ll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that for it.  Together with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation. This hasn’t been changed in many years.  And yesterday I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well, I know all of them. And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood, and they’re also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.  But because we’re now independent energy-wise, we’re energy independent, we have very few boats going over to Middle East. We used to have them going through the straits all the time. And you probably noticed that every once in a while they go after somebody else’s … They haven’t gone after us yet. If they do, they’ve got big problems, but we have very few boats going over there. They were saying the other day, they’ve never attacked an American boat. I’m not asking for trouble, but if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble. But then they said, “But you know, we don’t see very many American boats over here anymore.”  This week also bought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere. In recent days, we’ve achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We were with El Salvador today. A great, young gentleman became the president. He’s strong and tough, and he’s taking care of crime. He was really something today. I was very impressed with him. And likewise with Honduras, who we met. We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with …  … agreement with both and also with Guatemala. We’re working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible. That will make a tremendous difference at our southern border. And Mexico, I have to say, President Lopez Obrador has been outstanding, an outstanding partner and he’s doing a great job in Mexico. The cartels are way down and the numbers, our secretary’s here now, the numbers are way down, way, way down. And we’re doing that without the help of Congress meaning the Democrats in Congress who won’t give us a single vote to take care of loopholes. We have loopholes that are so horrible and it would be so easy to fix. And they know they should be fixed, but they don’t want to do it, because they don’t want to give Trump any credit.  Because it’s all about the election. That’s all they care about. They don’t care about our country, they care about the election. And the sad part is with all of the tremendous work that we’ve done this weekend whether it’s Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings, with all of this tremendous work that we’ve done, the press doesn’t even cover it. And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week. It was perfect, because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we’re taking care of doing, that we’re involved in in New York City at the United Nations.  So, that was all planned like everything else. It was all planned. And the witch hunt continues. But they’re getting hit hard on this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it’s a joke. Impeachment for that? When you have a wonderful meeting or a wonderful phone conversation? I think you should ask … we actually, you know, that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also. I can’t believe they haven’t, although I heard there’s a rumor out there, they want the first conversation.  It was beautiful, it was just a perfect conversation, but I think you should do that. I think you should do and I think you should ask for VP Pence’s conversation, because he had a couple of conversations also. I could save you a lot of time. They were all perfect, nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. But the word is that they’re going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it any time you need it and also, Mike Pence’s conversations, which I think there were one or two of them. They were perfect, they were all perfect.  It’s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They’re dividing. They’re belittling, they’re demeaning our country. So many leaders came up to me and they said sir, what you go through no President has ever gone through and it’s so bad for your country. People laugh at the stupidity of what they’ve asked for and here, we could do asylum, we could do all of these different things so easily. We could do asylum quickly, we could do loopholes, get rid of them.  Instead, we actually make deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and we’re doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we’re doing it. We get it done. The Wall is being built, by the way. That got little coverage. I went to the border. It’s going up in New Mexico, it’s going up in Arizona, it’s going up in California, believe it or not. They really wanted that wall in California in San Diego. As soon as it was completed, they said we don’t want a wall. They were begging me for a wall. I should take it out and move it to another location.  We were with the governor, spoke to him a lot, but the Governor of Texas, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Attorney General of Texas, the Senators of Texas, Cornyn and Ted Cruz. And we’re building an incredible wall that’s … number one, it’s going to look great, it’s going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you’re one hell of a mountain climber. It’s very tough, it’s going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they’re the real deal.  I went to the Secretary of Homeland Security and he got all his people together. I said give me four walls, your optimum, every single thing included and they gave me 20 percent less, 20 percent less, and 20 percent less, meaning less cost. They came back, they said this is the wall, sir. This would be the best. We have the panels on top, which are anti-climb panels. I don’t know if you noticed the steel on top. We have a different design for a different area, but this anti-climb, it’s very tough. We had people going out and real climbers telling us which is the toughest to climb, but these are anti-climb panels.  Very tough to get across and the wall is going up many miles a week and we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which will pretty much do it, because you have a bunch of natural barriers. You have mountains, you have really rough rivers. You have some really rough land that you can’t cross very easily. So, they serve as their natural walls, but we will, we think over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.  To combat the malice and corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families. And further, to promote American values on Monday, I was proud to be the first president in history to host a meeting at the United Nations … I’m so surprised, first president for this, I can’t believe that I’m first. I spoke to Franklin Graham about that, I can’t believe it, at the United Nations on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.  While some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight everyday against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years. You forgot the American people, you totally forgot the American people. This week, every week, I really can say of my presidency, we’re standing up for American prosperity, American security and the American way of life. And together with our friends and partners, we’re building a more peaceful, prosperous and promising future. We have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what’s going on and that includes in South America where they’ve been so helpful.  Where nobody thought this would be possible. The relationship with Mexico as an example or El Salvador or Honduras or Guatemala. Nobody even knew about it, yet we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in. We had tremendous … it was terrible. And we’ve got that stopped and the countries are now helping us. And we stopped those payments, by the way. We don’t pay those countries that money anymore, but I will tell you if they’re as good as they seem to be, they’re really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States, we’ll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.  So, with that, we had a tremendous three days. It was beautiful to see, made a lot of new friends. I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one and it’s been very busy, but it’s been very, very fruitful, so we could take a couple of questions. I’d love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA instead of the witch hunt, the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that’s what you want to ask, because it’s probably better for you, but it’s not better for the country. So maybe we’ll take a few questions. Please. Well, that’s what he did, isn’t it really, when you think about it. Look, that whole witch hunt was started and hopefully that’ll all come out, but there have been some fantastic books written that just came out whether you look at Greg Jared or McCarthy’s book that just came out recently and so many other books. A lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they’ve done to this country is a disgrace.  They’ve hurt this country very badly and no other president should have to go through what I’ve gone through. The president, the new president of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There’s a lot of corruption going on and there was corruption … I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That’s really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is I didn’t do it. You take a look at that call, it was perfect. I didn’t do it.  There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators. And they threatened. They said you do this, you do that, we’re not going to give you votes. That’s the real deal. So, we have an honest group of people that have been maligned and a lot of people say I’ll do even better. I’m very happy. Yesterday, I guess we had a 53 poll and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything, anybody voting for Trump, you can add … anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or seven points or six points, take it any way you want.  But I don’t know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment. And I guess that’s what happened in the last election. Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible. Well, I think you can look at your senators and you can look at Biden and you can look at all these other people, but what we’re looking for is corruption. An investigation started called the Russian witch hunt, affectionately, and it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elected and after that person namely me won and convincingly won at 306-223 in the Electoral College, which by the way, when you run a race, if you go by the college, Electoral College, that’s a much different race than running popular vote.  And it’s like the 100-yard dash or the mile, you train differently. And I can’t help it that my opponent didn’t go to Wisconsin and should’ve gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places, but that’s the way it is. We won an election convincingly, convincingly. And then you had the text message on well, if she doesn’t win, we’ve got an insurance policy. How bad was that? You know what the insurance policy … that’s sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years, the insurance policy.  Now, there are a lot of very dishonest people. We’re the ones that played it straight and you know what, the millions of people out there that are looking at what’s going on, those people understand it. They see it and they think it’s disgusting. And our people are being hurt and our country is being hurt when a Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical, far left socialists or worse. That’s pretty bad, that’s pretty bad. Especially when the senators and all of these other people have actually done what they’re accusing me of doing, which I didn’t do. I’m going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words, I’m going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words and then we’ll do a couple of more questions. Thank you. Okay. Go … Okay. Go ahead. Please. Not anymore, maybe. And maybe they just say that, Kristina. Oh I just think it’s progressing. I think they want to make a deal. They are losing their supply chain- Well I don’t want to say that but I can tell you that these two men, and in this case more specifically Steve, we’re having some very good conversations, and I guess it’s next week that’s coming in and the week after. So we have a lot of, we have a lot of talks going on and also by telephone. They want to make a deal and you know why they want to make a deal? Because they are losing their jobs and because their supply chain is going to hell, and companies are moving out of China and they’re moving to lots of other places, including the United States. And that’s not good. That’s far worse than they thought.  And by the way, in the meantime, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. We’re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs, and we’re helping our farmers who got targeted. Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again. They’re starting to go with the beef and all of the different things. Pork, very big on pork. But if you look and if you see, and they actually put out I think a statement, but they’re starting very heavy to buy our ag again. Now, they want to make a deal and they should want to make a deal. The question is, do we want to make a deal? Well, that would be a shame. Well, I don’t want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats, no, not one of the greats. That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed. It was, it was terrible. But no, we’re going to find out. That’s going to be a very interesting question with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can’t beat us at the ballot. They can’t beat us at the ballot, and they’re not going to win the presidential.  We’re having great polls. We have internal polls that are failed. Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania is looking good. North Carolina. We just won two races that a lot of people, we thought were going to lose both those races. One was down 17 points three weeks before the race and he ended up winning by a substantial margin, by a substantial margin, and … Dan Bishop. And then we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and he ended up winning by, what was it, 25 points or some incredible … I’ll ask you folks, ’cause I don’t want to be inaccurate, otherwise I’ll have a front page story. We have breaking news, Trump exaggerated. But he won by many, many points and he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by, in the 20s. So it’s, it’s been …  So we’re looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida. And you had one or two Congressmen, Democrats , saying, “Listen, we can’t beat him at the election, so let’s impeach him.” Right? Didn’t you hear Al Green. That’s a beauty, he’s a real beauty that guy. But he said very distinctively … It was all over the place. I don’t know, they’re trying to lose that tape I guess. But he said, “We can’t,” essentially he said, “We can’t beat him, let’s impeach him.” It’s pretty, it’s pretty dangerous stuff. Steve, go ahead. Yeah, I don’t- Because I was getting such fake news and I just thought it would be better, and now they’re asking for the first phone conversation and I’ll release that too if it’s important to you. But they’re asking for … ‘Cause I had a conversation previous, on a previous election plateau that he had hit. The current president hit a couple of different plateaus and I spoke to him previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call. Very, very innocent, very nice call. And as he said, “We were, I wasn’t pushed. I wasn’t pushed,” meaning pressured. He wasn’t pressured at all. But I don’t like the concept of releasing calls because when a president or a prime minister or a king or queen calls the United States, you don’t like to say, “Gee, we’re going to release your call to the fake news media, and they’re going to make you look like a fool.”  What happens is it’s hard to do business that way. You want to have people feel comfortable. So I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice. In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me when he read it, it was very interesting. He’s a good man, he’s a smart man. He said, “I can’t believe it. I never knew you could be this really nice to a person.” He said, “I cannot believe, you were so … I didn’t think you had that in you to be so nice.” I was nice. I’m nice to a lot of people. People don’t understand that, but I was, but he was shocked that it was such a nice call. Then if said there, he said, “There is nothing here,” and all fair people say the same thing.  But I don’t like the precedent, Steve. I don’t like it where you’re dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released. But I, I felt that … And you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it. Mike actually called up his counterpart and we spoke to Ukraine about it because we wanted, ’cause it could have been, if they didn’t want us to do it, we would not have done it. But he actually said, “That was a very innocent call. You can release it all you want.” Well, I thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Mueller report, no obstruction, no collusion. You look at all of the things that happened. Corey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day as a person that they have been tormenting. You look at all the people that they’ve tormented, all the legal fees. People came here with, with bright eyes. They wanted to make life so great for other people, and they left where they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn’t have, and it’s a sad thing. What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.  I have seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place, and they went home, they were dark. They got hit by Mueller’s subpoenas. I think there were 2,500 subpoenas or some ridiculous number, 500 people were interviewed, and yet they don’t interview Joe Biden and his son? If you’re a Democrat, you have automatic protection. That’s years and years of people putting in certain people into positions. But when you look at all of the trauma that these fakers have caused …  And the press look, the press is, much of the press is not only fake, it’s corrupt. These stories they write are corrupt. They’re so wrong, and they know that. You know, it used to be, I used to get great press until I ran for politics. I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press. I was very good at it and I got good. I mean, they covered me well for … Otherwise I probably wouldn’t be here. And once I ran I said, “Boy, this is incredible.” But if you see the way they treat, my family used to be treated great. My family works so hard. The people that work with me, these people, all of these people, they work so hard. They’ve done such a good …  Look, we have the greatest economy we’ve ever had. We have a military, two and a half trillion dollars, we’ve rebuilt our military. You don’t hear the vets complaining. We’ve got choice approved. It couldn’t be approved. But when you see what happened with the viciousness … And when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic, smart guy by the way, stand at the mic and act like he’s so serious. And then he goes into a room with Nadler and they must laugh their asses off. They must laugh their asses off.  But it’s so bad for our country. People have said … Rush Limbaugh, great man. Sean Hannity said it. A lot of people have said it, Mark Levin. They said they don’t know of one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know, or a woman, that could handle what I’ve had to handle. And I think that’s true, but I handle it. To me it’s like putting on a suit.  All right. How about one more question question on the economy? A question on the economy. Go ahead. Go ahead. Good, good, wow. How are you doing over there? Yeah, I would say pretty bad. Yeah, sad. And it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago, 15 years ago. It’s incredible. Right, I agree with that and we’re helping you. Go ahead. Well, I’d just say that socialism will never happen in the United States, can’t happen in the United States. And Venezuela … Unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart, because I know a lot about Venezuela. I’ve had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela. They live, many in Miami, a certain section of Miami. I won’t mention the name because they’ll say I’m thinking about my business and I’m not, but they are fantastic people and they like your president. They’ve voted overwhelmingly for me. They like what I’m doing for Venezuela.  We have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights, and we’re watching it very carefully. And you know what I would say? We’re giving millions and millions of dollars in aid. Not that we want to from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because on a humanitarian … People are dying. They have no food, they have no water, they have no nothing. They’re dying, no medicine. The hospitals are closed or don’t even have electricity. It’s so sad to see. Let me just say, we have it under control. We’re watching it very carefully and we’re going to be very, very … We’re watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games. We’re watching it very clearly. Just put this in the back of your mind. It’s all going to be fine. We know everything that you said, and it’s all going to be fine. We’re very much involved. We very much know what’s going on and we’re very much in. Well, okay. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"…a lot of work on health care. We’re very successful at it. And so we’re going to be speaking to the great people of Florida and I think they’re very happy with the job we’re doing. Yeah? What? Well, if you’re looking at the whistleblower’s complaint it’s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect and most people that have read it say the same thing. The whistleblower never saw the conversation, he got his information, I guess, second or third hand he wrote something that was total fiction. And now when people see that they’re not happy.  Well, we’re looking at a lot of different things. China’s coming in next week, we’re going to have a meeting with them. We’ll see. But we’re doing very well. Some of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats. I call them the “do nothing’s;” they do nothing for this country. They don’t care about this country, but the numbers really are looking very good going into the future. So, we’ll see. I have a lot of options on China, but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power. Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, that sort of major investigation into the bias, it’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Biden’s because how does a company that’s newly formed and all these companies did you look at … and by the way, likewise, China just started an investigation into the Biden’s because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with with Ukraine.  So, I would say that president Zelinsky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden’s because nobody has any doubt that they weren’t crooked. That was a crooked deal. 100%. He had no knowledge of energy, didn’t know the first thing about it. All of a sudden he’s getting $50,000 a month plus a lot of other things. Nobody has any doubt. And they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor. They got rid of them. Now they’re trying to make it the opposite way, but they got rie- So, if I were the president, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.  I haven’t, but certainly something we can start thinking about because I’m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy. He got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he’s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a pay off.  Well, I leave that to the lawyers. I can say though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar. We’ve known it for three years because they’ve been trying to impeach for three years. He’s a lie- He’s just stone cold liar. So, I leave that to the lawyers. That’s up to them to decide. But the whole investigation is crumbling. Yeah? I can. Yeah, I can. I can. I can.  We have a real problem. We’ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard. And as far as I’m concerned, they still haven’t recovered from killing 12 people, one who happened to be a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and they still have not recovered and they probably never will.  No. But I read Mitch McConnell’s statement yesterday and he read my phone call and as you know, he put out his statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he’s read. And I spoke to him about it, too. He read my phone call with the President of Ukraine, Mitch McConnell. He said that was the most innocent phone call that I’ve read. I mean, give me a break. Anybody that reads it says the same thing. And the only people that don’t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by shifty Schiffs.  Well, I think Biden is going down and I think his whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine and basically who are they really scamming? The USA and it’s not good. And that’s probably why China, for so many years, has had a sweetheart deal where China rips off the USA because they deal like people with Biden where they give their son a billion and a half dollars. And that’s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that for so many years they’ve been ripping off our guns.  We’re looking at it. We’re looking at it very closely. It’s under study.  We’ll see. They want to talk and we’ll be talking to him, too. We’ll see.  I’m going to … Yes? I heard very bad things about her and I don’t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her, but I heard very, very bad things about it for a long period of time. Not good.  Thank you. I’ll see you in Florida. I’ll see you all in Florida."
"Unemployment numbers just came out, and they’re the best numbers we’ve had in over 50 years. The unemployment number is down to 3.5%, so that goes way, way back. We haven’t had numbers like this in a long time. Wages are up by almost 3%, that’s a fantastic increase for everybody out there working. We’re very happy about those numbers. The stock market is substantially up as it was yesterday, and our country does well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is doing poorly, to put it mildly. And we continue to do very well, we’re the miracle.  But the unemployment numbers just came out, 3.5% unemployment, and that is a tremendous number, the lowest in over 50 years. So, very happy. And I think really very important, again, I’ll say, wages are up. When I was running, wages were nowhere. They were going down and people were having doing three jobs, and they were making less money than they made 20 years before. Now wages are up, so we’re very happy about that.  One other thing having to do with Poland. So Poland is a country, great people. We have a lot of Polish Americans living in the United States. I’ve just signed, I will soon be signing, and signed certain preliminary applications, we will be giving a full visa waiver to Poland. That means that people from Poland can easily travel there, and people from here can easily go back and forth. They can each, people from the U.S., people from Poland can very easily go back and forth between the United States in Poland. So they’ve been trying to get this for many, many decades, and I got it for the Polish people in honor of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland. So we’re very happy with that. Yeah? Well, I heard Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios. That’s good. He should’ve gotten them two and a half years ago. That’s a very nice question, let me shake your hand. Come here. That’s a very nice question. Almost a surprise, I figured that was a trick question. Well, we’ll be issuing a letter. As everybody knows, we’ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else. If you go over, not only history, I mean, you go over any aspect of life, you’ll see how unfairly we’ve been treated. We’ve done a fantastic job. Everything to me is about corruption. We want to find out what happened with 2016, and as you know, there’s a lot of work going on on that. I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption. His campaign, that’s up to him. Politics, that’s up to them. I don’t care about politics. Politics, as I think I made clear, and yesterday somebody asked me a question, and I gave an answer, but always in the form of corruption, what I want to do, and I think I have an obligation to do it, probably a duty to do it, corruption. We are looking for corruption.  When you look at what Biden and his son did, and when you look at other people, what they’ve done, and I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden, but I think there was beyond, I mean beyond corruption having to do with the 2016 campaign and what these lowlifes did to so many people to hurt so many people in the Trump campaign, which was successful despite all of the fighting us. I mean, despite all of the unfairness. So we are looking at corruption. We’re not looking at politics, we’re looking at corruption. I don’t know. Somebody said that a long time ago … was that in 2017? I don’t know, you’d have to tell me when. All I can tell you this, when I speak to foreign leaders, I speak in an appropriate way. If you notice, they don’t mention the call that I had with the President of Ukraine. They don’t mention that because it was so good. The only time they mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made it up. You talk about Pinocchios, that should get 10 Pinocchios. He made up a story, it was a phony story, Adam Schiff. So they don’t talk about that anymore.  You know when this came out, it was quid pro quo. Well there was none. Also yesterday, the Ambassador, who I heard was tremendous, and a tremendous person, he was 100% for what we’re saying, 100%. And if you look, he also said there was no quid pro quo. That’s the whole ball game. But now the Democrats don’t bring that up anymore because they lied. Look, they never thought I was going to release the phone call between the Ukrainian President and myself. When I released that call, they were jumping around like you wouldn’t believe. They didn’t know how to respond. And then they found out that the call itself was so bad for them. It was a perfect call. There was nothing. We hand that out. We’ve handed the call out to people, and they say, “Wow, this is incredible.” We’re very proud of that call. When I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an inappropriate manner.  Now, we’re also doing trade deals with China, and we’re doing deals with a lot of people for the country. So I’m not looking to insult people, I can tell you that, but we could probably find that out- No, it has nothing to do with it. No. No, I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s good for our country, and it could happen. As you know, they’re very much coming over, next week, as I understand it. So I’d like to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s a great trade deal for this country. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Well, I wouldn’t mind because we have no rights. The way they’re doing it, they’ve taken away our rights. So if they proceed, and you know, they’ll just get their people, they’re all in line, because even though many of them don’t want to vote, they have no choice. They have to follow their leadership. And then we’ll get it to this Senate, then we’re going to win. The Republicans have been very unified.  This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. So we beat the one that started immediately. We went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like at 10, it came out perfect. And a few days go by, and they start this nonsense, and this is just as ridiculous. So the Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes. They could vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them don’t believe they should do it. And I do believe, I do believe that because of what they’re doing, with Pelosi and they’re real leaders, AOC plus three, that’s their real leaders, I really believe that they’re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.  And we saw the first glimpse of it two weeks ago in a great state, North Carolina. We saw a great, great glimpse of what’s going to happen, because in North Carolina we had two races. One gentleman, Dan Bishop, was down by 17 points with three weeks to go, and he won easily. And the other man, as you know, Greg Murphy, was up by a very little bit, and he won by a massive amount. I don’t know, some place in the 20s, 20% or something, maybe higher. So I think you got your first glimpse of what’s going to happen. And the big key is that I have to campaign there. But if you look at what happened in North Carolina, two races, we won both of them, and we won them easily, and one was almost tied, and the other one was a big, big lead, and that one turned, and the tie became a land side. Well, I don’t know about Mitch. I have a lot of respect for Mitch McConnell. I know that I saw his statements, and he thinks that this is ridiculous, he thinks it’s unfair. I saw his statement yesterday that he put out where he read my phone conversation, and he thought it was a wonderful conversation. And it was. But see, the Democrats don’t talk about that anymore. They try and go to other things. These people are looking for anything they can get because they know they’re going to lose the election, and we’re in election season now. For them be doing this now, it’s never been done. What? So we’re dealing with North Korea. They want to meet, and we’ll be meeting with them. It’s probably being set up as we speak, but we’ll let you know. But North Korea would like to do something, Iran would like to do something. We have a lot of countries in a very good position right now, despite the witch hunt, which hurts our country and it hurts in America. But Iran wants to do something, North Korea wants to do something, and China would like to do something. I don’t know, that you’d have to ask … Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden? Well, that you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I can tell you just as an observer, what I saw Biden do with his son, he is pillaging these countries, and he’s hurting us. How would you like to have, as an example, Joe Biden negotiating the China deal. If he took it over from me after the election, he would give them … wait … he would give them everything. He would give them everything. How would you like to have that? Joe Biden would just roll out the red carpet, he’d give them everything.  So again, this doesn’t pertain to anything but corruption. And that has to do with me. I don’t care about politics, I don’t care about anything, but I do care about corruption. And to have somebody take out a billion-and-a-half dollars out of China, who is totally unfit, he’s unfit, to have him get a billion-and-a-half dollars, to have him, and now I’m hearing the number of 50,000 a month, now I’m hearing the number of $50,000 a month is very low, it’s a much higher number that Biden’s son was getting per month. In fact, it’s much higher. And for him as a totally unqualified person to be getting hundreds of thousands a month is very, very sad.  So again, is the Justice Department investigating that? I just don’t know. Well, I think they follow the leader. One thing with the Democrats, I give them credit for it, a lot of them don’t want it. You know that, you interview them. A lot of them are in, they call them Trump districts, where I won, and then they won after when I was in running. But I’m going to win them big. If you look at what’s happened with my polls, they’re through the roof. You know why? Because of this phony witch hunt. If you look at what happened with the fundraising, we’ve set a record, the Republicans, because people are sick and tired of it.  I got a call the other night from pastors, the biggest pastors, Evangelical Christians. They said, “We have never seen our religion or any religion so electrified.” They say they’ve never seen anything like it. Churches are joining, hundreds of thousands of people. And you know, that’s to a large extent because of you, and your partner, the Democrats. Well, I think this, I think this. We have a great relationship in the Senate. I have a 95% approval rating of the Republican Party. I believe the Senate, and I haven’t spoken to that many senators, but I believe the Senators look at this as a hoax. It’s a witch hunt. It’s a disgrace. Should have never happened. Just like Russia collusion delusion should have never happened, that was a witch hunt. And just like that, should have never happened. So I think of the Senate, I think they feel that the Republican Party has been treated very, very badly. Now in the House, they have the majority, they all vote with AOC plus three. Nancy Pelosi’s petrified of them. I mean, she’s afraid she’s going to lose her position. Nancy Pelosi will lose her speakership right after the election, when the Republicans take over the House. The one text message that I saw was just about the last text message, because I don’t even know most of these ambassadors. I didn’t even know their names. But the text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland, who’s highly respected, was there’s no quid pro quo. He said that. He said, “By the way,” it almost sounded like in general, he said, “By the way, there’s no quid pro quo.” And there isn’t. Now, for Biden. There would be. But listen to this, there is no pro quo. And that was the text message that I saw, and that nullified everything. We would have to look, but I tell you, what I asked for, and what I always will ask for, is anything having to do with corruption, with respect to our country. If a foreign country can help us with respect to corruption, and corruption probes, and I don’t care if it’s Biden or anybody else, but if they can help us, if Biden is corrupt, if his son is corrupt, when his son takes out billions of dollars, billions, and he has no experience, he just got fired from the Navy, when they do that, that’s no good. So the only, just to finish your question, anything having to do with corruption, I actually feel I have an obligation to do that. No, I don’t say anything is okay. I’ll tell you what’s okay. Here is what’s okay. If we feel there is corruption, like I feel that was in the 2016 campaign, there was tremendous corruption against me, if we feel there is corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country. And just so you know, just so you know- I was investigated. I was investigated. Okay? Me. Me, in my campaign, I ran, I won, I was investigated. You won’t say that, will you? I was investigated, I was investigated, and they think it could have been by U.K. They think it could have been by Australia. They think it could have been by Italy. So when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration. By the Obama administration, I was investigated. So when these people talk … But as far as I’m concerned, what I want to look at and what we want to investigate, anything having to do with corruption. I view China as somebody we’re trying to make a deal with, we have a very good chance of making a deal with. We’ve had good moments with China, we’ve had bad moments with China. Right now, we’re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it’ll be the biggest trade deal ever made, if we make it. But I view China as somebody that we deal with on the world’s stage. I would like to get along with China if we can, and if we can, that’s great. If we can’t, that’s okay too. But what we’re doing is we’re negotiating a very tough deal. If the deal is not going to be 100% for us, then we’re not going to make it.  And I will say this, I will say this. I will say this, China very much wants to make this deal. China’s getting killed. The tariffs are killing China. What’s happened is they have now three million loss of jobs, their chains are broken up. If you look at their supply chain, it’s a disaster. Companies are going to other countries, including us. China right now is a total disaster. No, no, no, no. Let me tell you, I’m only interested in corruption. I don’t care about politics. I don’t care about Biden’s politics. I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest. I picked somebody else a long time ago, and we’ll see what happens. But I never thought Biden was going to win, but I don’t care. I mean, frankly, if he won I’d be very happy. I think he’d be an easy opponent. But I never thought Biden was going to win. I don’t care about politics, but I do care about corruption. And this whole thing is about corruption. This whole thing, this whole thing is about corruption. This is about corruption, and this is not about politics. This is about corruption. And if you look, and you read our Constitution and many other things, I have an obligation to look at corruption. I have an actual obligation and a duty. What? I don’t know. That’s up to the lawyers. I know the lawyers think they’ve never seen anything so unfair. They’ve never seen anything so unjust. I’ve been president now for almost three years, and I’ve been going through this for almost three years. It’s almost become like a part of my day. But in the meantime, we have the best economy we’ve ever had. We have the best job numbers we’ve had in 51 years, the best unemployment numbers that we’ve had in a half a century. The best numbers that we’ve ever had. African Americans, Hispanic American, Asian American, women, everything, we have the best numbers that we’ve had in many, many, many decades. And you know what? People understand that. People are working, they’re making money. If you look at one very important number that was just announced, wages, up 3%. That’s unheard of. That’s unheard of. So it’s a great thing. I didn’t hear you. Go, go.  We’re investigating corruption. We’re not investigating campaigns. I don’t care about his campaign. As I said, I didn’t think and I don’t think Biden’s going to win. All right? I don’t think. And maybe to answer your question, when you say who is going to win, I’d rather not make a prediction, but I do have a feeling about somebody. But I didn’t think, because I’ve watched Biden over the years, and Biden is not the brightest person. I never thought he was going to win. I never felt he was going to win. If you look at his other two campaigns, he was a one percenter, he got very few votes. He got taken off of the garbage heap by Obama. Obama took him off the garbage heap, so it’s one of those things. But I never thought that Biden, I didn’t think Biden was going to win. I guess everybody has a shot, but I don’t think he would be, frankly, my toughest opponent either. And just to finish off, I don’t think that he will win. I didn’t think he was going to win, and I don’t think he is going to win. It’s fine. I mean, it’s fine. She’s a socialist, and maybe worse than that. But we’ll see. I heard, I haven’t seen these poll numbers. I haven’t seen Biden’s poll numbers. Look, Joe Biden was never going to make it, all right? He was never going to make it. He tried it twice, he was at 1%. There’s a reason. When I announced, I went to number one day one, and I stayed there the entire primary season. I never was off center stage. I was never given credit for that, but that’s okay, except by Steve. The only ones that gave me credit was Steve. Who? No, they were trying to set up a meeting, but he wanted sanctions lifted, and I said, “You must be kidding.” We had no interest. Rouhani wanted a meeting at the UN. We did talk. I didn’t speak to him personally, but our sides talked, he wanted sanctions lifted or partially lifted, and I said no. We’re watching Venezuela very, very closely. The people are suffering, and we are watching it very closely. We’re also giving big aid to Venezuela. Now, one thing, I’m now going to Walter Reed Hospital. We’re going to be giving out five Purple Hearts to unbelievably brave young people. And I’m going to meet you, some of you are going over. I don’t know, I think some of you are going over, so we can talk further over there. Although when we’re there, I would like you to respect the process. We’re giving out Purple Hearts to very brave people, wounded warriors, people that have been, I mean, they’re just incredible people, and I’m going to be back here in probably two hours. Thank you, good job here."
"He’s meeting today with some of our representatives. Mike Pence is leaving today, as you know. We needed to take an extra day for security reasons, but Mike is leaving. Mike Pompeo will be meeting also, who’s here right now with us and who’s going to be joining the meeting.  We have a lot of great people over there we’ll see. In the meantime, our soldiers are not in harms way, as they shouldn’t be, as two countries fight over land. That has nothing to do with us. The Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. As I said, they’re not angels, they’re not angels. If you take a look, you have to go back and take a look, but they fought with us. We paid a lot of money for them to fight with us and that’s okay. They did well when they fought with us. They didn’t do so well when they didn’t fight with us.  When I refused to allow the Americans, a year and a half ago, to fight with the Kurds against Iraq I said, “Wait a minute. This country, stupidly, just spend a fortune on fighting for, with, around Iraq.” Nobody knows how they spent it, but they spent, actually, we’re in the Middle East now for $8-trillion, if you can believe that stupidity. In Iraq, we’re in for probably five-and-a-half-trillion.  They’re telling me, “Wait a minute, we just spent five-and-a-half-trillion fighting in Iraq, and with Iraq. Now, we’re supposed to spend money to fight with the Kurds against the Iraq. I said, “No thank you.” What happens is, when I said we’re not going to fight with the Kurds, the Kurds left. They didn’t want to fight against Iraq, which right now isn’t the greatest fighting force in the world. That happened twice. The Kurds actually are pulling back substantially from Turkey, and Syria is pulling in.  Syria probably will have a partner of Russia, whoever they may have. I wish them all a lot of luck. Russia was involved in Afghanistan. It used to be called the Soviet Union. Now, it’s called Russia for a reason. Because, they lost so much money in Afghanistan that they had to downsize. A very big downsizing. If Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that’s really up to them. They have a problem with Turkey, they have a problem at a border, it’s not our border. We shouldn’t be losing lives over it. Again, we only had 28 soldiers. It was 26, 28. I got all different numbers. It ends up being 28, between the 26, 28. Two people, and they’re fully accounted for.  That’s the story. It’s very simple. We’re watching, we’re negotiating, and we’re trying to get Turkey to do the right thing, because we’d like to stop wars regardless. Whether Americans are in, or whether they’re not in, we want to see war stopped. That’s a very important thing. On a humanitarian basis, we want to see that happen. Steve? Why don’t you go and dictate? Yes, please. I viewed the situation on the Turkish border with Syria to be, for the United States, strategically brilliant. Our soldiers are out of there. Our soldiers are totally safe. They’ve got to work it out. Maybe they can do it without fighting. Syria is protecting the Kurds. That’s good. By the way, every player hates ISIS. Everybody were talking about. Syria, more than us. Russia, more than us. They’ve done a big number on Russia, and were over there fighting ISIS but they’re over there fighting ISIS too. They can handle it, and they should handle it. We can fight our own battles on our own territories. You have a lot of countries over there that ha hate ISIS as much as we do. In some cases, probably more. They can take care of ISIS.  We have them captured. The United States captured them. Some were released just for effect, to make us look a little bit like, “Oh gee, we got to get right back in there.” You have a lot of countries over there that have power, and that hate ISIS very much. As much as we do. I think we’re in a very strategically good position. I know the fake news doesn’t make it look that way, but we’ve removed all of our, as we said, 50 soldiers, but much less than 50 soldiers. They’re now in a very, very safe location, heading into an even safer location.  We will help negotiate. We have tremendously powerful sanctions. Our countries become economically much more powerful than, frankly, it ever was. We picked up trillions, and trillions of dollars in worth. The market was up big yesterday. It’s going to be up big today, it looks like. The trade deal with China, just having to do with what we’ve done with the financial services, with banks, with the farmers has been incredible. Far greater than anyone ever thought. I agree, it hasn’t been papered yet, but it’s being papered.  In the meantime, as you know, and as we’ve said many times, China’s already started buying. They want to buy, they want to make a deal. They really have to make a deal. Their economy has been hurt very badly by what we’ve done, and by the tariffs that we’ve charged. We’ve taken in tremendous amounts of tariffs. A small portion of that we’ve given to the farmers, which has more than made up for what they’ve lost. Go ahead.  Because of the newfound economic power of the United States, because of the fact that we’ve made so many trillions, many, many trillions of dollars in worth of the United States to, I call it the newfound economic power. If my opponent would have won, China would right now be the most powerful nation economically in the world, and right now they’re not even close. If we’re smart, they never will get close. It depends on who sits in this chair.  The United States has tremendous economic power. Far more power than playing around with having a few soldiers shooting each other at the border. You have a few soldiers, back and forth killing each other at the border. The power we have with sanctions and tariffs as far greater than what we’re talking about. With that being said, our military has been completely rebuilt. Much of the equipment’s already been delivered. We spent two-and-a-half-trillion dollars rebuilding it over the last three years. Our military power is at the highest level, and our economic powers is at the highest level. I’d always rather use economic power before I use military power, because people aren’t getting killed with economic power, okay?  Please go. In theory, there can’t be retaliation, because this was an award that we got because of the fact that the European Union took advantage of past presidents. This was an award that we got for the unfair treatment given to the United States by the European Union, so there should be no retaliation. This was getting us even, because seven-and-a-half-billion dollars worth of things happened. Bad things happened, unfair things happened to the United States by the European Union. This was just getting us back to even, and nobody else but me would’ve gotten that seven-and-a-half-billion dollars back for the taxpayers of the United States. Yeah. Yeah. Now look, John Bolton, I get along well with him. Some people didn’t. Some people didn’t like John Bolton. I actually got along with them pretty well. It just didn’t work out. I don’t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani was seeking out corruption, and what happens mostly in the 2016 election, because there was tremendous corruption in the 2016 election. I think even you would admit that the election, it was disgraceful what happened, and what happened to me, and what happened to the Republicans. That continues with Nancy Pelosi, and with Schiff. Adam Schiff got caught making up statements that he said I said, that I didn’t say, which is fraud. It’s purely fraudulent, so it continues.  Rudy was a great prosecutor. He was the best mayor in the history of the city of New York, as far as I can see. I think he’s pretty much acknowledged what he did for crime, and everything else. When he saw what was going on with our election of 2016, the election I won, but the election that was absolutely corrupted by things that took place in government. Now, we’ll see what happens. The IG report’s going going to come out soon, and we’ll see what happens.  I think people, I know nothing about it in terms of the report. I’m waiting for the report like everybody else, but I predict you will see things that you don’t even believe, the level of corruption. Whether it’s Comey, whether it’s Strzok and his lover, Page, whether it’s so many other people; McCabe, whether it’s president Obama himself. Let’s see whether or not it’s President Obama. Let’s see whether or not they put that in. Wait a minute. Let’s see whether or not.  Rudy saw that, and I can tell you Rudy Giuliani, because he was very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw, as are many people, okay, and many Republicans. The Republicans have been treated very unfairly by the Democrats. I’ll say this. Paul Ryan would never issue a subpoena. I don’t say right or wrong. He wouldn’t do it. He had too much respect for our country. Nancy Pelosi hands them out like cookies. Everybody. I don’t even know these people, and for the most part people like that . I don’t even know who they are. I never even heard of some of them, most of them, but I have all these people testifying. Then, they leak out. They don’t say the good parts, they only say the bad parts.  We’re not allowed to representation. We’re not allowed to lawyers. We’re not allowed to have anything. The Democrats have treated the Republicans very, very badly. Fortunately, we have a lot of good, strong, smart Republicans, but they never dealt, John, with the Democrats the way the Democrats deal. The Republicans won’t forget it, because what they’re doing, what the Democrats are doing to this nation is a disgrace. What they have done, the disrespect that they’ve shown to the Presidency, and it’ll happen to them. If the Republicans have the house, which I think they will, because of impeachment. I think that because of this nonsense, impeachment, it’s based on a perfect phone conversation. An absolutely perfect phone conversation with the President of Ukraine.  A friend of mine who’s a top lawyer, , he said, “This is perfect. You didn’t say… Did you know this was going to happen?” I actually thought it was going to happen. There were many people listening to that conversation. When I speak to a leader, like if I speak to the President of Italy, if I speak to anybody, I know that there are many intelligence people on the line. I know that, with my understanding of knowledge. I don’t know exactly who, but I assume there are many people. Fortunately, they had a transcribers, stenographers, people that do this for a living on the line because we have an exact copy of the report of the call.  The call was put out immediately when I started hearing about the whistleblower. Well, the whistleblower’s report was totally wrong. The whistleblower it didn’t know what he was talking about, or was given false information, or was even worse than that. Now, all of a sudden Schiff doesn’t want to talk to the whistleblower. Now, all of a sudden, quid pro quo doesn’t matter because now they see, in the call, there was no quid pro quo. With Rudy, Rudy was seeking out corruption. I think there’s nothing wrong with seeking out corruption.   Did you have, Steve? I don’t know what he did. I don’t know. That’s up to him. That, you have to ask… Excuse me, no. You have to ask Rudy those questions, don’t ask me. Rudy was one of many people that was incensed at the corruption that took place during that election. Pure corruption. For instance, I still ask the FBI, “Where is the server? How come the FBI never got the server from the DNC? Where is the server? I want to see the server. Let’s see what’s on the server.” The server, they say, is held by a company whose primary ownership individual is from Ukraine. I’d like to see the server. I think it’s very important for this country to see the server. Nobody wants to see it. The media never wants to see it, but I’ll tell you, Republicans want to see it, so Republicans aren’t treated well.  Here’s the problem. I think we’re going to take the House based on what’s happening with the impeachment stuff. The Republicans can do the same thing in reverse if they ever have, and I hope it’s going to be a long time because nobody’s done a better job with the economy, with our military. Whether I’ve rebuilt the military, our economy is the best that’s ever been. We have numbers that just came out where, not including taxes, the median household income for the average American has increased $5,000 in a very short time since I’ve been President. Nobody’s ever heard of numbers like that.  People want to find out, why was it so corrupt during that election? I want to find out more than anybody else. Steve, go ahead. We’re confident, and we have a great air base there. Very powerful air base. That air base alone can… Take anyplace. It’s a large, powerful air base. Turkey, just so people remember. Turkey is a NATO member. We’re supposed to get along with our NATO members, and Turkey is a NATO member. Do people want us to start shooting at a NATO member? That would be a first. That’s all involved having to do with NATO. Yeah. I’d say this. I think that she’s done this country a tremendous disservice. She’s created a phony witch hunt, another one. First one failed. They’re all failing. This one is just absolutely crazy. All you have to do is read the transcript of the call. Read the transcript. This is a open and shut, simple case. They’re desperate, because they know they’re going to lose the election. They’re desperate to do something, because they know they’re going to lose the election.  This administration has created the strongest economy in the history of our country. We have the greatest stock market. We had over a hundred times, we broke the record for stock market. If you look at people’s stocks, their 401ks. If you look at anything you want to look at, they’re far better off now than they probably ever have been in this country. Record stock markets. Don’t forget, stock market’s not just rich people, it’s all people. All people own in the stock markets. New York stock exchange, all of them. They’re at record highs. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done.  They’re playing games. They figure, they can’t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground. We’ll get somebody that Trump never met and maybe they’ll say something bad about Trump. If they do really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit. I don’t think it’s going to work. They’ve treated the Republican party with great disrespect. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.  My meeting with the family was really… it was beautiful in a certain way. They did not want to meet with the person in question, but we had a very good meeting. They’re very nice people. We met with the full group. It was four people, actually. You know how it’s all broken up, and the meeting took place right here at about six o’clock last night. It was very sad, to be honest. She lost,, and they lost their son. I believe it was going down the wrong way because that happens in Europe. You go to Europe and the roads are opposite, and it’s very tough. If you’re from the United States, you do make that decision to make a right turn where you’re supposed to make a left turn.  The roads are opposite, and she said that’s what happened. That happens to a lot of people, by the way. She said that’s what happened. She was in the room right out there. We met right here in this area. I offered to bring the person in question in, and they weren’t ready for it, but I did offer. I spoke with Boris. He asked me if I’d do that, and I did it. Unfortunately, they wanted to meet with her. Unfortunately, when we had everybody together they decided not to meet. Perhaps, they had lawyers involved by that time. I don’t know exactly. I know the people were lovely. They were very nice, and they were desperately sad. I thought they were. Based on what I saw, they wanted to meet. Now, they say they only want to meet if they’re in the UK. That’ll be up to them. I did meet the family, and I expressed condolences on behalf of our country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.  Wait, wait. There’s a great question I’m being asked. This is maybe the greatest question I’ve been asked in a long time. Please put those mics over here. Go ahead, say it again. We are looking at Italy very strongly. As you know, the seven-and-a-half is to be a divided the way we say. We’ve divided it up. Italy has got a problem with the way we’ve divided it up, because they said they had much less to do with it, and Germany had more to do with it, and France had more to do with it, as an example. We are going to look at that very strongly. Ambassador Lighthizer is here. We’re going to look at it very strongly, okay? Thank you. Good question. I love that question. Thank you all very much. Thank you.  They’re doing a bad thing. I’ll talk to you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Steve, please treat them nicely. Treat Italy nicely. Afternoon Press Conference Transcript  Thank you very much. Today, it is my honor to welcome President Sergio Mattarella of Italy to the White House. We’ve known each other for a while. We’ve dealt with each other for a while, and we’ve had some really great conversations. We’ve had a very productive discussion throughout the day with our staffs and representatives, and I look forward to hosting the president and his daughter, Laura, at a reception for the Italian Americans this evening. I look forward to that very much. The United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome. Over the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture, and music. On Monday, we paid tribute to the Italian explorer who led a voyage of discovery to the New World, a gentleman known as Christopher Columbus, and to me, it will always be called Columbus Day.  Some people don’t like that. I do. Today, the United States and Italy draw a strength from our cherished heritage as we work together to safeguard our people and promote prosperity. As NATO allies, our countries cooperate closely on a wide range of critical defense issues, including the protection of our nations against radical Islamic terrorism. The problem is that Italy is only paying 1.1% instead of the mandated 2%, which by and of itself is a low number. It should be probably 4%, anywhere from four to five percent. Only eight of the 29 NATO countries are paying the 2%, meaning 20 of the countries are delinquent in the payment to NATO, and they have been for many years. And Germany is at 1.3% at most, depending on calculations. Spain is at less than 1%. Turkey, believe it or not, is almost current, almost paid up, and I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg because he’s going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true, but it’s still only a large fraction. It’s still a large fraction of the amount of money that’s owed by many of the countries that aren’t paying their dues.  We hope that Italy will boost its defense spending in order to meet NATO’s minimum 2% of GDP, and I will say that they have just purchased, and we learned about it today, 90 brand new, beautiful F35s. The Strike Fighter program is doing phenomenally well. One of our major challenges and the challenge facing NATO today is instability in the Mediterranean, North Africa areas, and much of the volatility in that region stems from the violence in Libya, which is very close to Italy’s borders. President and I were talking about that at great length, big problem. The ongoing Libyan conflict has led to a migration crisis, placing significant and unfair burdens on Italy in particular. I’ve asked that the European Union get much more involved because they’re not involved enough. That’s a problem for the European Union. They do very well with us on trade. They had a trade surplus with the United States over the last five or six years of about $150 billion a year. They have to get more involved and help Italy.  The Italian government has stepped up as a leader to fight this illegal immigration. We urge, also, our NATO and European partners to take firm action to halt illegal immigration and uphold sovereign borders. Immigration control is critical to national security and essential to the well-being of our citizens. Nations must be able to vet, screen, and properly manage entry and admission into society. You know the legislation that we had passed, we have absolutely no help from the Democrats on our borders, absolutely nothing. The closure of loopholes, which would be very easy to do, they refuse to do. They want open borders, and Italy doesn’t want open borders, and we’re not going to have open borders, and our numbers are very good. I want to thank, also, Mexico and the president of Mexico for the great help they’ve given us. They’ve helped us much more than the Democrats. Here in the United States, we’re taking dramatic action to secure our borders, shut down smuggling networks, and speed the removal of illegal immigrants.  We’re moving the MS-13 gang members out literally by the thousands. They’re getting out. We’re dropping them out of our country, and they can’t come back. And what we’ve done with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador is, they tell me, close to a miracle, the agreements that we’ve signed. They accept them back, and they keep them back. It’s a much different relationship than we’ve ever had with those three countries, and I want to thank the leadership of those three countries. We’ve been working well, very well together. Our message is clear. If you enter illegally, the United States, you will be promptly returned home. They’re all returning home. It takes a long time because we’ve had years of people coming and staying, and that’s the end of that. President Mattarella, he also discussed the steps we must take to enhance commerce and economic growth between our two countries. Our nations are already investing nearly $70 billion in each other’s economies. Without the burdens, as unfair as they are, imposed by the European Union, we would actually have a much higher number than $70 billion between Italy and the United States.  However, we can do more, and we can achieve fairness and reciprocity, which we don’t have right now. America’s trade deficit with Italy accounts for about 20% of our nearly 150 to 170 billion dollar, probably according to some estimates, it could even be $178 billion annual trade deficit with the European Union. We welcome Italy’s support for a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the EU that ensures a level playing field for American workers, and it hasn’t been that for many, many years. I could solve the problem instantly, but it would be too harsh. It’d be too harsh. It would involve tariffs on European products coming into this country, and for right now, we’re going to try and do it without that. But that would solve the problem instantly because the United States is not being treated fairly. We also welcome Italy’s participation in combating predatory trade and investment practices worldwide, especially in technology. We must work together to shield our intellectual property, critical infrastructure, ports, and data security.  I applaud Italy’s recent commitment to use only safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains, especially relating to the 5G networks. We will work together to take further steps to secure the technology of the future, and speaking of 5G and how it relates to China, we’ve done a rather incredible trade deal, especially right now, phase one, for our farmers and for the finance industry, financial services, and it’s been really quite amazing.  Excuse me? Is there a problem back there? It’s been quite amazing. The level of receptivity has been much different than in the past. China and myself are representatives. They’re representatives. I made a deal from 40 to 50 billion dollars in farm products, agricultural products. People said we were hoping for 20. So, China’s been good, and they’ve already started purchasing, by the way. That’s already started. The agreement, we hoped to have it signed sometime prior to Chile. We’re going to Chile. President Xi and myself will probably do a signing over there of phase one, assuming it all gets finished up, which we think it will. There’s been a lot of good will between the United States and China over the last period of time. So, we’re signing from 40 to 50 billion dollars, and that will … because it was incorrectly reported in the press, shockingly. That will take place. It’s already started taking place. They’re already purchasing a lot of foreign product.  All of the banking regulations and all of the financial services, all of the other things that are included, and there are many other things in phase one that I won’t talk about now, but all of that is moving along rapidly. Bob Leitheiser is with us someplace here, and he is in the process of getting it completed. Have a great staff of people working on both sides. Mr. President, it’s a true pleasure to host you in our nation’s capital, you and your family and your deeply personal relationship to your country. You love your country so much. Just in speaking to you for a short while, I see how much you love Italy, and I can understand that. It’s really an inspiration, a testament to the patriotism and pride of the Italian people, great spirit for Italy. America is grateful to have true friends and allies in the citizens of Italy. We have such a great relationship with the people of Italy.  The United States is, likewise, thankful to be home to more than 16 million Italian Americans. Tonight, here at the White House, we’ll celebrate our deep and abiding friendship with Italy and the really incredible Italian people, the US-Italian alliance is stronger than ever before, and we’re going to be celebrating that tonight with you, Mr. President. So, I look forward to that very much in a little while. And in the meantime, thank you very much, and we’d love to have you say a few words. Thank you. Well, thank you very much Mr. President and the WTO, the World Trade Organization, as everyone knows, we just won seven and a half billion dollars because of unfair trade practices and that will be distributed in a fair way throughout various countries in Europe. And we’re talking to the president about that as it pertains to Italy. He thought we were a little bit harsh on Italy and we don’t want to be harsh on Italy. We’ll never do that, so we’ll look at that. Very strongly. We will look at that for you. That was one of the requests made and we will be taking a look that. Please. How are you? Now, President Erdogan’s decision didn’t surprise me because he’s wanted to do that for a long time. He’s been building up troops on the border with Syria for a long time as you know. Our soldiers are mostly gone from the area. We only had 26, 28 but under 50. We think it’s probably 28 but under 50 soldiers. And which is a very tiny force. And it didn’t surprise me at all. This is, they’d been warring for many years. It’s unnatural for us, but it’s sort of natural for them. They fight and they fight long and they fight hard and they’ve been fighting Syria for a long time and on the border, that’s the border with Syria. And I say, “Why are we protecting Syria’s land? Assad’s not a friend of ours. Why are we protecting their land?”  And Syria also has a relationship with the Kurds. Who, by the way, are no angels, okay, who is an angel. There aren’t too many around, but Syria has a relationship with the Kurds. So they’ll come in for their border and they’ll fight. They may bring partners in, they could bring Russia in. And I say, welcome to it. Russia went into Afghanistan when it was the Soviet Union and it became Russia, became a much smaller country because of Afghanistan. You can overextend, you could do a lot of things, but frankly, if Russia is going to help in protecting the Kurds, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. But it would be led by Syria and Syria doesn’t want Turkey to take its land. I can understand that, but what does that have to do with the United States of America if they’re fighting over Syria’s land? Are we supposed to fight a NATO member in order that Syria who is not our friend, keeps their land? I don’t think so.  But Syria does have a relationship with the Kurds. The thing that’s common is that everybody hates ISIS. Now the PKK, which is a part of the Kurds as you know, is probably worse at Terra and more of a terrorist threat in many ways then ISIS. So it’s a very, a semi-complicated, not too complicated if you’re smart, but it’s a semi-complicated problem and I think it’s a problem that we have very nicely under control.  We have two countries wanting their land. We have one country that wants land, perhaps that doesn’t belong to them because they want to have a 22 mile strip of, they call it freedom, they call it a lot of things. They want to get terrorists out. You have another country that says you can’t have our land and they’re going to have to work that out.  Now with that being said, Vice President Mike Pence is going there. He’ll be leaving either late tonight or tomorrow and he was going to leave yesterday, but they have to have certain security done. He’s very important man in our country and he’ll be leaving with Secretary of State Pompeo. We already have representatives there negotiating with Turkey. We put massive sanctions on Turkey and we have additional sanctions on Turkey and when I ran, I ran on a basis we’re going to bring our great soldiers back home where they belong. We don’t have to fight these endless wars. We’re bringing it back home. That’s what I won on. And some people, whether you call it the military industrial complex or ,beyond that they’d like me to stay. One of the problems I have and one of, for instance with the witch hunt, you have people that want me to stay. They want me to fight forever. They do very well fighting. That’s what they want to do. Fight. A lot of companies want to fight because they make their weapons based on fighting, not based on peace and they take care of a lot of people.  I want to bring our soldiers back home. We’re not a police force. We’re a fighting force. We’re the greatest fighting force ever. I spent two and a half trillion dollars over the last almost three years rebuilding our military. When I took it over, it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. It was totally depleted. You know that. A lot of people know that. Honest people all know that. When I was thinking about having to do something, one of our generals came in to see me and he said, “Sir, we don’t have ammunition.” I said, “That’s a terrible thing you just said.”  He said, “We don’t have ammunition.” Now we have more ammunition than we’ve ever had. We have more missiles, we have more rockets. Our nuclear has been totally updated and in some cases, new. Hopefully to God we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful nuclear base by far in the world and we have things that we never had before. We have a great modern military, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to waste it. It doesn’t mean we’re going to deplete it like we did before with these crazy endless wars.  So Turkey and Syria will hopefully work it out between themselves. Hopefully ISIS will be guarded. I told, I spoke with, as you know, a wonderful man yesterday, a general from the Kurds. You all know who I’m talking about. Some of you have seen the letter that I put out to Erdogan.  I gave it to him, President Erdogan, and some of you have seen it. With the general, I said, “Listen, don’t open those doors and let them out just to create more havoc so that we come in.” Because some of those doors we just opened, let’s create some havoc and some political exposure for the president of the United States. We were the ones that contact, we were the ones that got ISIS. We’re the ones that took care of it, specifically me because I’m the one that gave the order because when I came in under President Obama, ISIS was a disaster all over that area. I was the one that got them. We were the ones that captured them. And I will say this, that Russia, Iran, Syria and to maybe a slightly lesser extent, Turkey, they all hate ISIS as much as we do and it’s their part of the world.  We’re 7,000 miles away. I campaigned on bringing our soldiers back home and that’s what I’m doing. That includes other places, too, many other places. Statutorily it takes a period of time. Diplomatically, it takes a period of time. But you know, we’re in many countries, many, many countries. I’m embarrassed to tell you how many, I know the exact number, but I’m embarrassed to say it because it’s so foolish.  We’re in countries, we’re protecting countries that don’t even like us. They take advantage of us. They don’t pay, nothing. You probably saw, some of you wrote and covered the fact that we’re sending some additional troops to Saudi Arabia. That’s true. And I appreciate the fact that I negotiated for a short period of time, a matter of minutes with Saudi Arabia and they’ve agreed to pay for the full cost of all of that deployment and more, much more. A very rich country, they should be paying. And so should many other countries be paying if they want this kind of protection.  Same thing with NATO. We’re at 4% and other countries are at 1% and certainly a European country benefits much more than we do with NATO. I mean it’s there for a reason and perhaps we benefit, but not nearly as much as the European countries. Some people say we don’t benefit at all. We put ourselves in harm’s way. But we do that for Europe, but then they treat us badly on trade, not fair.  So I would say that we’re in a great position. We’re doing what I said. We have two countries that are going to argue over their border. Hopefully they’ll work it out. We’re going to try and work it out. I think our vice president is a very capable man. We’ll do well tomorrow. He’s going to meet with President Erdogan. President Erdogan said he wouldn’t meet with anybody and he took that back just a little while ago and he said, “No, I will.”  And I think they’ll have a successful meeting. If they don’t, the sanctions and tariffs and other things that we’re doing, we will do and are doing to Turkey will be devastating to Turkey’s economy. I’ve got Pastor Brunson home. Nobody else could do it. The previous administration tried very hard. They were unable to do it. I did it very quickly and let’s see what happens, but I think we’ll be successful. But we got to get out of the endless wars. We have to bring our troops back home. I go to Walter Reed and I give out Purple Hearts. Just did it on Friday. I see the incredible soldiers coming home to Dover, coming home in a coffin on areas that we have nothing to do with. We have nothing to do with and it’s heartbreaking. I sign letters all the time to parents whose son was shot in different places in the Middle East, mostly.  It’s very heartbreaking to see. Very heartbreaking. So I’ve said it and it’s through strength, not through weakness, much harder to do what I’m doing. I could be, like all of these others, oh, just leave them there, leave them there. Now I can’t do it. Much easier for me much, probably politically better for me just to say, “We’ll leave a lot of people there and we’ll fight.” They don’t even know what they’re fighting for.  It’s much more difficult politically. It’s not politically expedient. It’s just the opposite. And I have people, even on my side, they want to fight. I say, “Why are we fighting? I don’t know.” They don’t even know. So you have Syria and you have Turkey. They are going to argue with that. Maybe they’re going to fight it out, but our men aren’t going to get killed over it and just one other thing. They’ve been fighting for hundreds of years. It’s been going on for hundreds of years. So it’s a long answer, but I think I’ve got much of it out. Thank you very much. Please question? By the way, the digital tax, I have to say is interesting because I did discuss it with another European union member, namely France and France is basically doing the digital tax. And I’m no fan of those companies. They were against me. Somebody said, I lost maybe 2 million votes, maybe more, because of Facebook, but these are American companies and whether you like it or not, they’re great big American companies, and I’m not happy with the digital tax where France and European union is taxing our companies.  And as you know, we imposed a big tax on French wine because of it. So just to answer your question, Kevin, I’m not happy about the fact that they are taxing our companies. I’m not a fan of those companies, but if anybody’s going to text those companies, it should be the USA. It shouldn’t be France and the European Union, who have really taken advantage of the United States. Okay. Thank you very much. Good question. Okay. You can pick somebody, Mr. President. Yes. Well, I don’t know the details. I just know that our country is looking into the corruption of the 2016 election. It was a corrupt election, whether it’s Comey or McCabe or Strache or his lover, Lisa Page, the two great lovers. There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does, but you look at Brennan and you look at Clapper. Then you’ve got some real beauties. I know that they’re looking into the corruption. Obviously the IG reports coming out soon, so we’ll-  … get into the corruption. Obviously the IG report’s coming out soon, so we’ll find out. I don’t know anything about the meeting, but certainly it would be appropriate because the word is, and you read it in the same papers that I do, that they did go to other countries to try and hide what they were doing. Italy may have been one of them. So you’ll really have to ask Attorney General Barr. Okay. Thank you. John, go ahead. Sure. I didn’t give him a green light.  the same thing as you just … When you make a statement like that, it’s so deceptive. Just the opposite of a green light. First of all, we have virtually no soldiers there. They were mostly gone. Just a tiny little group and they would’ve been in harm’s way. You have a massive army on the other side of the border. But more importantly, I didn’t give him a green light. And if anybody saw the letter, which can be released very easily if you’d like, I could certainly release it. But I wrote a letter right after that conversation, very powerful letter. There was never given a green light. They’ve been wanting to do that for years and frankly they’ve been fighting for many, many years.  And when you ask a question like that, it’s very deceptive, John. It’s almost as deceptive as you showing all of the bombings taking place in Syria and it turned out that the bombing that you showed on television took place in Kentucky. So I’m not even sure that ABC apologized for that, but certainly it was a terrible thing. I’m looking at this, I say, “Wow, that’s pretty bad.” And it was in Kentucky. It wasn’t in Syria. So I don’t know what you’re going to do about that, but I think ABC owes an apology. No. Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers and fighting other peoples’ wars. I want to get out of the Middle East. I think Lindsey’s focused right now when judiciary, like the Democrats, the Do Nothing Democrats as I call them, because they’re doing nothing. They’re getting nothing done. They’re not getting USMCA done between Canada, the United States and Mexico. They’re getting nothing done and I think Lindsey should focus on judiciary. He ought to find out about what happened with Comey, what happened with McCabe, Lisa, what happened with Peter Struck, what happened with President Obama, what happened with Brennan. That’s what Lindsey ought to focus on. That’s what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on. The people of South Carolina don’t want us to get into a war with Turkey, a NATO member, or with Syria.  Let them fight their own wars. They’ve been fighting for a thousand years. Let them fight their own wars. The people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home and I won an election based on that. And that’s the way it is. Whether it’s good or bad, that’s the way it is. And if you look at this country, I’d be willing to bet anything, political instinct, that that’s what the country wants. I’m not going to get involved in a war between Turkey and Syria, especially when, if you look at the Kurds … And again, I say this with great respect, they’re no angels. If you look at PKK, take a look at PKK. ISIS respects PKK. You know why? Because they’re as tough or tougher than ISIS.  You take a look at a lot of the things having to do … You have to say it. Nobody wants to say it. We’re making the Kurds look like they’re angels. We’ve paid a lot of money to the Kurds, tremendous amounts of money. We’ve given them massive fortunes. And you know what? It’s wonderful they fought with us, but we paid a lot for them to fight with us. But just so you understand, we were the ones that captured ISIS. People let some go. They opened a couple of doors to make us look as bad as possible.  We have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria is not happy about it. Let them work it out. We shouldn’t be over there. And you should get your accounts correct. And you shouldn’t be showing up buildings blowing up in Kentucky and say it’s Syria because that really is fake news.  Yes, please ask a question. Absolutely. Russia. Russia hates ISIS. Russia hates ISIS as much as the United States does. Iran hates ISIS. I mean, we’re fighting a war for Russia. We’re fighting a war for Iran. You look at Syria, Syria hates ISIS. We’re over there killing ISIS and we’re killing … Don’t forget, we’re 7,000 miles away. So we’re killing ISIS. We’re 7,000 miles away. Russia’s much closer. Iran is right there. Turkey is right there. They all hate ISIS. Turkey a little bit less so. But the others very much. Russia had a plane blown up by ISIS. Russia wants nothing to do with ISIS. Russia’s tough. They can kill ISIS just as well and they happen to be in their neighborhood.  And all I’m saying is this, I’m not going to lose potentially thousands and tens of thousands of American soldiers fighting a war between Turkey and Syria. Syria is not our friend. Assad is not our friend. That’s the way it goes. Please ask a question . 28. They say it was 28. We thought it was 50, but it was about 28, 26 to 28 troops. And all accounted for, nobody injured. Listen, all accounted for. Nobody injured, nobody missing. It’s really nice. You know what’s happened? No American soldiers have been killed. That’s what’s happened. And other people will go in and very easy to recapture those people that probably the Kurds let go to make a little bit stronger political impact. And that’s okay. I fully understand it. But that’s the way it goes. We’re bringing our soldiers back home and we’ve done a great job.  We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago, and we’ve been a police force. It’s time to bring our soldiers back home. That’s the way it is. We’ve had no soldiers injured or hurt. That’s because I’m president and we’re the boss. Just remember that. We have the most powerful military in the world by far. Please. Well, I’ll answer first. Yes, I am satisfied. They’ve been very accommodating. They weren’t at the beginning and they have been since then. And I want to just thank the Italian government and your Prime Minister actually in addition to the President. But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied and we just discussed the same conversation with the President. Very satisfied. Thank you. Well, actually the tariffs situation is interesting because we just, it’s like I said with China and turned out to be true. We cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States, and in this case, the European Union, also true with China. That turned out to be right. We’ve collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We’ve given some to the farmers to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won’t be able to produce even that much, but I think they will because of their incredible ingenious. As I say jokingly, but probably not jokingly, they’ll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they’re doing right now. But the farmers come out so well. But in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can’t lose that because they do much more business than we do. And that’s unfortunate. But the word reciprocity is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semi-complicated, complicated, to me not complicated at all things that we’re doing, it’s got to be reciprocal. And it’s not. The European Union’s taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come through one way or the other through the European Union. That’s the good news. The bad news is they’ve been very smart. They’ve been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he’s leaving, but he’s been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.  And so that’s changing now, but we can’t lose that particular war of tariffs because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It’s tremendous. And if you look at what they don’t have, the barriers that they put up, they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europe. Tremendous barriers, both from a monetary standpoint and what they call non-monetary barriers.  It’s a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes, they send BMW, they send Volkswagen, Renault in the case of France. So it’s a very tough situation for us for many years, but now it’s a very tough situation for them because I can remedy the situation very easily. And there really is not any financial counter attack. Hopefully I don’t have to do that. With all of that being said, we are talking. We’re talking with some new people in Europe and I hope it’s going to be successful. That way we don’t have to talk about it or worry about it because our relationship should be a great one. But we have to be treated fairly on NATO and we have to be treated fairly on trade with the European Union."
"Okay. Thank you very much. We have a cabinet meeting? We’ll have a few questions after grace and if you would Ben, please do the honors. Thank you Ben, that was a great job, appreciate it. The economy is doing fantastically well. It’s getting very close to another record. We’ve had many records since we won office. We’re getting very close to another record. I don’t know if anybody saw the household median income for eight years of President Bush, it rose $400. For eight years of President Obama, it rose $ 975 and or two and a half years of President Trump, they have it down as two and a half years, it rose $5,000 not including $2,000 for taxes. So it rose, let’s say 7,000. So in two and a half years, we’re up 7,000 compared to 1,000, compared to 400 and that’s for eight years and eight years. That’s a number that just came out. But that’s a number that I don’t know how there could any dispute or any… I’ve never heard of a number like that. Meaning the economy is doing fantastically well.  We need for our farmers, our manufacturers, for frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it’s voted on, it’ll pass. It’s up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. If she puts it up, it’s going to pass. It’s going to to be very bipartisan. It’s something that’s very much needed and will be hundreds of thousands of jobs. Mexico and Canada have approved it. It’s done. They are waiting for our approval and we can’t seem to get the votes. I call them the do nothing, Democrats. I mean that, they’ve done nothing, but this is something they can do very easily. We’ll give them bipartisan approvals and credits, all the credits they want, but they have to be able to do it.  So the economy is doing fantastically well. We want to vote on USMCA. We have other trade deals that we’ve done. We’ve done South Korea, which is a fantastic deal for us. It turned out even better than we thought. South Korea was a terrible deal. The person in charge of that particular deal, Hillary Clinton if you’ve heard of her? She’s the one that’s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent. Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent. So that’s a scam that was pretty much put down.  Tulsi, I don’t know Tulsi, but she’s not a Russian agent. I don’t know Jill Stein, I know she likes environment. I don’t think she likes Russians. If she does like them, I know she’s not a asset. She called her an asset of Russia. These people are sick, there’s something wrong with them. I think that Tulsi Gabbard probably got helped quite a bit by . I think we were helped, because it shows for two and a half years we end up winning. I had to go through two and a half years, if she would have done this earlier, people would’ve realized what a scam it is. Everybody’s a Russian or an Russian agent or an Russian asset.  The economy again is at a level that it’s never been. We are doing, whether it’s household income, whether it’s almost any chart, and I think maybe the best of all is unemployment. Unemployment has reached historic lows, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American reached numbers that nobody ever thought would be possible. Have the lowest ever in history.  So if you’re black, if you’re Hispanic, if you’re Asian, anybody, African American, Hispanic American, Asian, the lowest in history. For women, the lowest in 71 years, the best. When I say lowest, I’m talking about the best, both the best unemployment numbers and the best employment numbers. Either way you want to cut it, you can say them both, because it’s best in both. As far as employment is concerned, we have the most people working today than ever before in the history of our country. We’ve never had this close to 160 million people. So it’s some incredible things are happening.  Syria, we will be giving a much fuller report, Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense, Esper and the different people that are very much involved, Mike Pence, Vice President. We’re having very good news coming out. The ceasefire’s holding, the Kurds are moving out to safer areas beyond the safe zone as we call it. Having the safe zone is not a bad thing. It’s a good thing and plenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their border. So you have to look at it both ways. But the ceasefire’s absolutely holding. There’s some skirmishes, but very little, relatively speaking. Of course, if you watched the fake news, it’s pretty wild. It’s really holding.  I’ve watched these pundits that had been working on this thing for 20 years. They’ve been working on the Middle East for 20 years. They don’t know what they’re doing and they’re telling me what to do. They say, “What did Trump get out of it? What did he get out of it?” I’ll tell you what I get out of it. We won’t be fighting and we’ll bring our soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days and they’d been there now for 10 years, in Syria, 10 years. They’re supposed to go in, do a quick hit on ISIS and come out.  Now as far as ISIS is concerned, when I took over November, 2016, ISIS was all over the place. I’m the one, meaning it was me and this administration working with others, including the Kurds that captured all of these people that you’re talking about right now. With President Obama it was a mess and I was told and you were told and everybody told it would be years before you ever did what I did in about a month and a half after I started. I went over to Iraq. I met with our generals and then we figured out a plan and it was done within a month and a half. So I’m the one that did the capturing. I’m the one that knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits. I have to smile to myself. I was telling a couple of people, “I’m watching these people that I’ve been watching for 20 years, I’ve been watching the same faces. They’re just a little bit older and a little bit grayer. I’ve been watching them for 20 years saying about the Middle East and they’ve been wrong on everything they’ve ever said.”  Now all of a sudden he was starting to say, you know what Trump is doing is great and we have tremendous, tremendous power because since the election of 2016, November, since that beautiful day, our country’s picked up in value, trillions and trillions of dollars of worth, trillions and trillions of dollars. Numbers that nobody would believe, numbers if I would’ve said it on the campaign trail, I would’ve been excoriated by the fake media, excoriated. The numbers are far greater than anything that even I predicted. You hear that with the household median income? $400 for eight years, $975 for eight years. $7,000 for two and a half years up. Nobody’s ever seen numbers.  Larry Kudlow is going to speak in a minute and he’s going to tell you that’s one of the greatest strengths of our country. By the way, other areas and countries are doing poorly. Europe is doing very poorly. Asia is doing very poorly. China is doing very poorly, worst year they’ve had in 57 years, I wonder why. I wonder why. I’m sure you can’t figure it out. We’re doing great. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China and they’re  the tariffs because they devalued their currency and they’re pouring money into their economy because they don’t want to lose the jobs. But they are loosing the jobs, they’re having a terrible year, worst than 57 years they say. If they say that it means it’s worse and they announced that they have the worst numbers they’ve had in 20 years, they announced six, I don’t think it’s six. I think it’s probably minus something. Could very well be minus, could very well be in negative territory.  But we’re doing great. By the way, the deal with China is coming along very well. They want to make a deal because they have to make a deal, I think. they have to make a deal because their supply chain is going down the tubes, their supply chain is broken like you’ve never seen anything broken before. It’s broken. So our soldiers who are in Syria, they’re moving out very nicely. ISIS is being held by the Kurds and I have an absolute commitment from Turkey that they’re watching them just in case. So we have a double, we have the Kurds are watching them. As you know, most of the ISIS fighters that we captured, we, we, not Obama, we, we captured them. Me, our country captured them, working with others, including the Kurds and we helped them. Don’t forget, we helped the Kurds. Everyone said the Kurds helped us, that’s true. We help the Kurds. They’re no angels, but we helped the Kurds and we never gave the Kurds a commitment that we’d stay for the next 400 years to protect them. They’ve been fighting with the Turks for 300 years that people know of and nobody ever committed, “Gee, if you do this, we’re going to that, we’re going to stay with your forever.” Nobody every said that.  But when I watch these fondants that that always are trying to take a shot. They say, “What are we getting out of it?” You know what we’re getting out of it, we’re bringing ourselves back home, that’s a big thing. It’s going to probably work, but if it doesn’t work, you’re going to have people fighting like they’ve been fighting for 300 years. It’s very simple. It’s really very simple, but we’re going to bring our soldiers back back home.  So far there hasn’t been one drop of blood shed during this whole period by an American soldier. Nobody was killed. Nobody cut their finger. It’s been nothing. They’re leaving rather, I think, not expeditiously, rather intelligently, just leaving, leaving certain areas, leaving. We’ve secured the oil. If you remember, I didn’t want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian so I had no power over it, but I always was speaking against going into Iraq. It was not a great decision, but I always say if you’re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here, keep the oil, we want to keep the oil. We’ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, They have some cashflow. Maybe we get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly, but they’ll have some cashflow which they basically don’t have right now. Everybody’s fighting. It’s not a big oil area, but everybody’s fighting for whatever there is. So we have a lot of good things going over there and they’re going very well.  As far as the continuation of the witch hunt, we beat the Russian deal. We beat the Muller deal. Now I find out, as I said before, that they’re trying to make other people into Russian agents, Russian assets, it has no credibility. Now they have what should be extremely easy to beat, because they have a perfect phone call. I made a perfect call, not a good call, perfect call. In fact, a friend of mine who’s a great lawyer said, “Did you know this would be the subject of all of this scrutiny? Because the way you expressed yourself, this is like a perfect call. You must have known this was going to happen.” No I didn’t. That’s just the way I talked to the President of Ukraine, who by the way said there was no pressure. There was no blackmail, there was no anything.  Congressman Hurd, I have to tell you yesterday, it was great, it was great, what he said, I gained a lot of respect for him very quickly because he said, “You know with all of this going on, I haven’t heard one Ukrainian say there was pressure. I haven’t heard one Ukrainian, not one, say that there was pressure of any kind. There haven’t even been reports of it to our people. Nobody’s even said it.” The reason you haven’t heard it, because there is no pressure,. The conversation I had was perfect. What happened is I released the conversation and that through shifty Schiff off. He’s a corrupt politician.  Schiff is a corrupt politician, that threw him off because he made up a lie. He made up what I said in my conversation and it went before the United States Congress and he said a made up story. It was fabricated. He totally fabricated it. They say he’s a screenwriter. Well, this was screen-writ. It was a fabricated story.  So he made up a lie and I released, they never thought that I’d do this. I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had and now the game was up. The other thing is the whistleblower and the other whistleblower and the informer, all these people, they seem to have disappeared. You know why they disappeared? Because they talked about another conversation, a conversation that I never had. They made up a conversation. Now if you look at the whistleblower report and you look at the actual transcribed conversation, the actual conversation that I had and you couple that with the President saying that that was a perfectly fine conversation. I don’t even know. He doesn’t even know what they’re doing. He didn’t even know about the money not being paid. Okay? I think that came out somewhere that the money… He didn’t know that. Then you also have his foreign minister saying, “No, it’s a very good conversation.” There was no anything asked there. There was no pressure whatsoever, so this is a phony investigation.  I watched a couple of people on television today talking about it. They were talking about what a phony deal it is, what a phony investigation it is, and the Republicans have to get tougher and fight. We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican party for the election, which is coming up, where we’re doing very well. Where I had a record crowd, the history of the arena it’s the biggest crowd they’ve ever had and we had 20,000 people outside at least.  We’re doing great in the election, you saw what happened in North Carolina. We picked up two seats that people didn’t think we were going to pick up, that was two weeks ago. Last week, a governor that people thought was okay, went down and now he’s got a big election. He was under 50%, nobody thought that was going to happen. We’re doing very well. But a lot of the stories that are made up between a guy like shifty Schiff who’s a phony guy, corrupt politician, the media buys it because unfortunately the media is corrupt also, much of the media, so much of it. Such a big percentage of it. It’s such a shame. Some great reporters, some great journalists, but some really bad people.  So that’s the story. The economy’s good. We’re doing well with getting out finally after 10 years, again 30 days to 10 years and we’re getting out. Nobody, none of our people are injured. It’s very smooth thus far and I think that you’re going to see something that’s going to be good. Remember this, if Turkey misbehaves, I don’t think they will, but we have a power that nobody thought we had, to the extent, it’s called sanctions. It’s called tariffs. We’ll tariff the hell out of their product coming here. They send tremendous amounts of steel to the United States and other things. We will tariff them and we will sanction them, but I don’t want to use that as a threat, because Mike Pence and our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, they went out and they negotiated a very good five day cease fire. I’m sure if we needed a little extension that would be happening. But our power is our power of economics, it’s a great power.  We’ve rebuilt the military since November of 2016. Our military was totally depleted from being in stupid situations like this for so many years. Our military was depleted to a level that we had very little ammunition, I was actually told we had no ammunition. Now we have more ammunition than we’ve ever had. Our military is as strong or stronger than it’s ever been. Probably stronger than ever. In a few short months as the equipment pours in from the money we’ve spent, two and a half trillion dollars, it will be in a level that it’s never even come close to. It’s a big difference. All made in the USA, all made in the USA. So we’re doing very well. If anybody has any questions, please feel free. Excuse me? We don’t think it’s going to be necessary. I don’t want to leave troops there. It’s very dangerous there. We had 28 troops, as it turned out, people said 50, it was 28 and you had an army on both sides of those troops. Those troops would have been wiped out. I don’t think it’s necessary, other than that we secure the oil, it’s in a little different section, but we secured the oil.  The other region where we’ve been asked by Israel and Jordan to leave a small number of troops is a totally different section of Syria, near Jordan and close to Israel. That’s a totally different section. That’s a totally different mindset. So we have a small group there and we’ve secured the oil. Other than that, there’s no reason for it in our opinion. Again, the Kurds are going to be watching… we’re working with the Kurds, we have a good relationship with the Kurds, but we never agreed to protect the Kurds.  We fought with them for three and a half to four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives. Remember this, when Iraq was fighting the Kurds, everybody thought we were going to fight with the Kurds. I said, well, it’s a little strange that we’re fighting with the Kurds when we just spent $4 trillion on Iraq and now we’re going to be fighting Iraq. So what I did is I said, we’re not going to take a position. Let them fight themselves. I thought the Kurds would do very well.  Everyone said, oh, the Kurds will do very well. Well, Iraq moved in and the Kurds left. They didn’t fight because they didn’t have us to fight with. A lot of people are good when they fight them with us. When you have $10 millions worth of airplanes shooting 10 miles in front of your line, it’s much easier to fight.  But with that, they were a good help, but we were a great help to them too. They were fighting ISIS, they hated ISIS, so they were fighting ISIS but we never agreed… where’s an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds. It never said that. We have protected them, we’ve taken very good care of them and I hope they’re going to watch over ISIS because that’s, again, most of it’s not in the safe zone as we call it. Some places call, demilitarized zone, in the old days would call areas like this, a demilitarized zone.  Our relationship with the Kurds is good and they’re going to be safe and I will say this, if shooting didn’t start for a couple of days, I don’t think the Kurds would have moved. I don’t think frankly you would have been able to make a very easy deal with Turkey. I think when it started for a few days, it was so nasty, that when we went to Turkey and when we went to the Kurds, they agreed to do things that they never would have done before the shooting started. If they didn’t go through two and a half days of hell, I don’t think they would’ve done it. I think you couldn’t have made a deal.  People have been trying to make this deal for years, but we’re close to making it. We’ll see what happens. Again, they’ve been fighting for 300 years that we know of, 300 years. So why should we put our soldiers in the midst of two large groups, hundreds of thousands potentially of people that are fighting? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Yes? Well I think the Democrats fight dirty. I think the Democrats are lousy politicians with lousy policy. They want open borders. They don’t care about crime. They want sanctuary cities. They don’t care about drugs. They don’t care about almost anything. They don’t care about USMCA. How about that? I think they’re lousy politicians, but two things they have, they’re vicious and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don’t have people like that. They stick together. You never see them break off. You never see somebody go out and… that’s why I respected so much what I watched with Will Hurd today, because he was one of the few that didn’t seem to be there, and yet he made a statement. He said, “Well, I haven’t seen any complaints whatsoever from the Ukrainians. If the Ukrainians didn’t complain and they didn’t tell any of our ambassadors.”  This thing is all about a letter that was perfect. You never hear the letter anymore. It was all about whistleblowers. You never hear… what happened to the whistleblowers? They’re gone, because they’ve been discredited. What happened to the informant and where’s the IG? Why didn’t IG read the letter, read the transcript? He could have gotten that, I guess. I assume, I would have declassified it for him, if I had to do that.  Why didn’t he read this and then see that the whistleblower’s account was totally different than the letter. Then he would have said, “Oh there’s no problem here.” The whistleblower gave a false account. Now you have to say, well, do we have to protect somebody that gave a false account? These whistleblowers, they have them like they’re angels. Okay? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation? I don’t know. You tell me. Do we have to protect the informant? Now-  I don’t know. You tell me. Do we have to protect the informant? Now I happen to think that probably wasn’t an informant. You know the informant went to the whistleblower, the whistleblower had second and third hand information. You remember that. It was a big problem, but the information was wrong. So, was there actually informant, maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it’s possibly Schiff. Why didn’t Schiff say that he and his staff or his staff or a whole group? Why didn’t he say that he met with the whistleblower. He knew all about the whistleblower. Why didn’t he say. He’s a crooked politician? Very bad for our country.  This whole thing is very bad for our country. In the midst of that, I’m trying to get out of wars, and we may have to get into wars too. Okay. We may have to get in wars. We’re better prepared than we’ve ever been. If Iran does something, there’ll be hit like they’ve never been hit before. I mean, we have things that we’re looking at, but can you imagine? I have to fight off these low lives, at the same time I’m negotiating these very important things. That should have been done during Obama and Bush and even before that. All right. So, that’s where we are right now.  Go ahead please. Well, they got to to be sent initially to different parts and get prepared that ultimately we’re bringing them home. We’re bringing our troops back home. I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home. Now it’s not very popular within the beltway, because you know Lockheed doesn’t like it, and these great military companies don’t like it. It’s not very popular. And outside the beltway, my largest cheer in Dallas, I have 25,000 people close in that arena. A record crowd. I had so many people outside of the arena. Thousands. My largest cheer that night was two things, “We’re building the wall.” That’s number one, and number two and probably tied for number one was, “We’re bringing our soldiers back home.” That was our largest cheer in Dallas. Great place, great state, Texas, tough state. They’re tough. When I said we’re bringing our soldiers back home, the place went crazy. But within the beltway, you know, people don’t like it.  It’s much tougher for me, be much easier for me to let our soldiers be there and let them continue to die. I go out to Dover and I have to, I meet parents. It’s not a pleasant thing. It’s the most unpleasant thing I do. Most unpleasant than I do. I see that big cargo plane open and I see those coffins get rolled off. Or when I go over to Walter Reed Hospital where the doctors are incredible, by the way, saving people that could have never been saved even five years ago, you know that. But those people are horribly wounded, horribly, horribly wounded. Wounded warriors.  It’s the toughest thing I do. Toughest thing is sending letters. I send many letters home to parents and I speak to parents, but I’ve sent many letters home to parents, their son or daughter has been killed over in the Middle East. For what? For what? There are times to fight, and there are times not to fight. There are times to be smart. We have tremendous economic power, and we’re using our economic power. Much more powerful in certain ways than playing with guns, and much better for our country, and much better for everybody, and actually much better for humanity. Okay. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.   Doral very simple situation. I own a property in Florida. I was going to do it at no cost, or give it free. If I got a rule entrance as a question as to whether or not you’re allowed to give it, because it’s like a contribution to a country would have to get a ruling, but I would have given it for nothing. It’s a lot of money. I would’ve given away. Like I give away my salary, I give away my salary. It’s I guess close to $450,000. I give it away. Nobody ever said he gives away a salary. Now it comes up because of this, but I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I’m surprised to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president who did, but see whether or not Obama gave up his salary.  See whether or not all of the other of your favorites give up their salary. The answer is no. They say it’s the only one. They think George Washington did, but that they say no other. So, I give up… It’s a lot of money for $450,000, close to, and I give that up. So, I have a place that’s in the best location. I’m very good at real estate. Very, very good. Very much better than you even understand. When you see my financials, which I’ll give it the right time. You’ll say, “Man, he does much better than we even thought.” This guy knows right here. Mnuchin, because he was in the private sector. He knows very much what I have. He would tell you. Someday, maybe he’ll tell you. But I’m very good at real estate. There’s Miami, this facility, everybody would’ve had their own building. Everybody in the G7 would have had their own building.  It was so good. Florida loved it. They love economic development. It’s not because… It’s a beautiful place. It’s new. It’s been totally rebuilt. It’s new. Everything’s new. It’s got massive meeting rooms, unlimited for security, because it’s on, you know, hundreds of acres. Best location. Right next to the airport. Miami International, one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it’s the biggest, but one of the biggest airports in the world. It’s only minutes away, and it would’ve been great. But the Democrats went crazy. Even though I would’ve done it free. Saved the country, a lot of money. Then they say, “Oh, but you’ll get promotion.” Who cares? You don’t think I get enough promotion? I get more from promotion than any human being that’s ever lived. I think I get, I think I would have that… I think I can say that fairly safely. I think I get more promotion than any human being that’s ever lived.  Some good, some bad. The people that like me only give me only good, the people that don’t like me, give me only bad. But that’s the way life is. I don’t need promotion. I don’t need promotion. Okay. But I was willing to do this for free and they would had, it would have been the greatest G7 ever. And I would have said to my family, because they run my business now, I don’t run my business. I actually put all this stuff in trusts. They run my, and I didn’t have to do that, but under no obligation to do it, you know, I don’t know if you know what, George Washington, he ran his business simultaneously while he was president. Many other presidents, there weren’t too many really rich presidents, but there were a few. They ran their business. Hey, Obama made a deal for a book.  Is that running a business? I’m sure he didn’t even discuss it while he was precedent. Yeah. Here’s a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that? That’s only, you know, a couple of examples, but other presidents, if you look, other presidents were wealthy. Not huge wealth. George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time. But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk. I don’t think you people with this phony Emoluments Clause. And by the way, I would say that it’s cost me anywhere from 2 to $5 billion to be president. And that’s okay. Between what I lose, and what I could have made. I would have made a fortune if I just ran my business. I was doing it really well. I have a great business, and the best properties, but between when I was… And you know some properties, Doral’s an example. Doral we’re setting records when I bought it, because I owned it for a period of time. Setting records.  It was going to, there was nothing… I was making a fortune. And then what happened? I announced I’m going to run for office, right? And all of a sudden I say, “We’re going to build a wall. We’re going to have borders. We’ve got to have this, we’ve got to have that.” All of a sudden people, some people didn’t like it. They thought the rhetoric was too tough. And it went from doing great to doing fine. It does very nicely now. It’s actually coming back I understand very strongly.  But Doral was setting records, that I knew this would happen. Most of the stuff that I have, because now instead of having 100% of the market that loves you, and they love your brand, and it’s luxury, and it’s great, now you have 50% of the market that’s called politics. I fully understood that. So, it’s cost me between 2 billion and $5 billion, and if I had it to do again, I do it in an instant, because who cares? If you can afford it what difference does it make? If I had this to do again, because I’m making a big difference for the country. The country is stronger now than it’s been in many years, maybe ever.  Our military’s rebuilt. Our economy is hitting records. As I said, “Best unemployment numbers, best employment numbers. We’re strong. We’re bringing our soldiers back home from the endless wars. We’re doing great.” So, whether I lost $2 billion, $5 billion, more or less, doesn’t make any difference to me. I don’t care. If you’re rich, it doesn’t matter. I’m doing this for the country. I’m doing it for the people that show up. I haven’t had an empty seat at a rally. I always say, “Where’s the rally?” It’s in a certain place. “Okay, just get the biggest arena.” I go into these massive basketball arena, like in Dallas where the Mavericks play, and fill it up, and set a record.  I’ve set a record almost every place I’ve been, because we just need a little small stage. We don’t need basketball courts, ice hockey courts, and I take less than musicians, because they have bands. I don’t have band. Set the world record for somebody without a guitar. Okay. I don’t have bands. Right? So, that’s the story, and you know those people are the poll, and I’ve had great polls. I’ve had my best polls now. I think it’s because people think that it’s terrible what they’re doing. Pelosi, shifty Schiff, Schumer. These people are trying to destroy the country. It’s a very bad thing what they’re doing. The President of the United States should be allowed to run the country, not have to focus on this kind of crap. While at the same time doing a great job when Syria and Turkey and all of the other things that we doing.  North Korea. Okay. Maybe someday, but I’ll tell you what, if somebody else became president with that same mindset that they had, you’d write down, we had a big war with North Korea. You don’t hear too much about it. Could happen. Could happen. I don’t know. I always say who knows. It’s deals. Who knows? But in the meantime, North Korea is, I liked Kim. He likes me. We get along. I respect him. He respects me. You could end up in a war. President Obama told me that. He said, “The biggest problem, I don’t know how to solve it.” He told me, “He doesn’t know how to solve it.” I said, “Did you ever call him?” “No.” Actually he tried, 11 times, but the man on the other side, the gentleman or the other side did not take his calls. Okay. Lack of respect, but he takes my call. Thank you very much everybody. We’ll look at other locations. I don’t think it will be as exciting. I don’t think it will be as good. It’ll cost the country a fortune, because it’s very expensive. I know France had a budget of many, many millions of dollars. They just did it. They did a great job by the way, but France had a budget of many, many millions of dollars. It’s going to cost, you know, fortune for the country. I was willing to do it for free, but if people didn’t like that, they thought I may get some promotional value. I need promotional value so badly, but I don’t need promotional. Go ahead. What’d you say? What else Steve? Nope.  You mentioned the word impeach. Well, I think they want to, any Democrat wants to, because they’re not going to beat me in the election. So, of course they want to impeach. Why wouldn’t they want to impeach me? It’s so illegitimate, but it cannot be the way the founders, our great founders meant this to be. But I see this guy, Congressman Al Green say, ” We have to impeach him. Otherwise he’s going to win the election.” What’s that all about? But that’s exactly what they’re saying, “We have to impeach him, because otherwise he’s going to win.” I’m going to win the election. Look, I have the strongest economy ever. It’s the economy stupid, right? I have the strongest economy in the history of our country. Okay. We’re setting records over 100 times. I think it’s like 118 but over 100 times. We’ve had the highest stock market in history, since November 8th. Over 100 times. Now, by the way, the day I got elected the following day from there until January 20th the market went through the roof.  You know why it went through the roof? Because they got rid of Obama, and they got rid of Clinton, and if anybody else, if any of these people that have been watching on this stage got elected, your 401ks would be down the tubes. They’d go down, not 20% or 30% they’d go down 70, 90, 80. It’d destroy this country. You’d destroy the country. So, I think they want to impeach me, because it’s the only way they’re going to win. They’ve got nothing. All they have is a phone call, that was perfect. All they have is a whistleblower who’s disappeared. Where is he? He’s gone. Then they have a second whistleblower. “The second whistle blower’s got, Oh, it’s going be… ” Where is he? He disappeared. Then they have an informant. “Oh, the informant is… ” Where is he? They’re interviewing ambassadors who I’ve never heard of. I don’t know who these people are.  I never heard of them, and I have great respect for some of them. One of them said just recently, a very, very highly respected man. I’m not going to get into their names, but a… Said, “No, no. We were very, very bothered by Joe Biden, and his son.” Back during the Obama administration. He said, “We were very… ” He’s supposed to be their witness. Don’t forget many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the never-Trump or Bush era. You know, you had a never-Trump or Bush. You have heard of those. Those people might be worse than the Democrats.  The never-Trumpers. The good news is they’re dying off fast. They’re on artificial respiration I think, but no, impeachment they want to impeach, and they want to do it as quick as possible, and that’s pretty much the story. Okay. I think I have great Republican support. No, I don’t think so. No, you don’t. I have to do what I have to do. I’ll tell you what. I want to bring our soldiers back home. If people want to leave them there. I’ll take that every day. All I know, you were at Dallas. All I know is the place went crazy when I said “We’re bringing our soldiers back home.” Within this little area. It’s a very unique area. They may feel that, but I have to do what I got elected on, and I have to do what I think is right now.  Now, if I got elected on something and think I was wrong, I’d second guess myself. I’d change. But they want our soldiers back home, and I think we can do as well or better frankly, let them, they’ve got to, they’ve got to keep going at each other. It’s artificial to have these soldiers walking up, and down between two big countries. And by the way, I’ve just informed Larry Kudlow is going to say a few remarks if you want… Would you like to stay for Larry’s remarks? Because he’s a great, great remark maker. Larry, after that whole thing, Larry, get up and go get it. I’m sure it’ll be great. Let them know how we’re doing Larry. We’re doing poorly, let them know, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. Maybe ever Larry, right? Maybe ever. You check it. I don’t think it’s ever been done. They’re predicting whose going to win the election Larry. Is that what you’re saying? Almost never happens. Right. It’s true. We’ve cut regulations more than any administration in history. And that’s in two and a half years. So, in two and a half years we’ve cut more regulation than any administration in the history of our country, and they’ve been for eight years, and in one case for more than that. So, that’s been pretty good. Thank you very much Larry. That was very good. And Russ Vought. Russ if you could talk about- Okay, great. I think I’ll, maybe start with you, Andrew, if you could please. Thank you very much, and I know you’re working on the small refineries, getting that straightened away so that it’s going to be terrific for small refineries. They’ve been hurt for a long time. We gave them waivers for this year, and that’s helped them a lot. I’d like for you to work on that, make sure the small refineries are happy. And for the farmers, ethanol now has been full approved. We spoke with Joni Ernst, we spoke with, and very importantly, we spoke with Chuck Grassley. The ethanol, the whole situation with ethanol that has been going on for so long, for so many years, we have that now where it’s finished, approved, done, and we’re getting things ready to sign. Perhaps, Senator, you could just talk about ethanol for our farmers for a couple of minutes, please. They seem to be very happy. They deserve to be happy, they’ve gone through a lot. They were targeted by China, as you know. We took some of the money out of the tariffs, $16 billion, and $12 billion for the two last years, and we gave it back to the farmers. They don’t even want it, they just want a level playing field, but they were targeted unfairly by China.  Now, China is buying tremendous amounts of product, agricultural product. They’ve started, maybe Bob Lighthizer could give us just a little update. I noticed that today, China set down a statement that the deal is coming along very well, that they expect to have a deal. Do you want to talk about China for a couple of seconds, Bob? One real example is the farmers. They were told, and I was told if we can get $20 billion a year purchased, the biggest they’ve ever done is $16, is what I’ve heard and what they’ve said. If we can get $20 billion a year from China, if China purchases $20 billion a year of agricultural product, that will be a great thing. My people had $20 billion done, and I said, “I want more.”  They said, “The farmers can’t handle it.”  I said, “Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very simple. They’ll buy more land, and they’ll buy larger tractors, but I want more.” I said, “We want $60 billion, to $70 billion,” and we agreed to $40 to $50 billion. They wanted $20 billion, and I got $40 to $50 billion, and they’ve already started buying. That’s just the way it goes. I want to thank China for that. And they have started the buying while we’re papering the deal, and that’s going well. We hope to sign it, probably in Chile when we have a summit in Chile, or wherever that may be. We’ll be able to, we think, sign a completed document with China on phase one. And then we start working on phase two.  Actually, things in phase two are easier than phase one. But it’s so big, and an example of the agricultural products, it’s so big that we thought doing phases would be good. But actually, the things in the second phase are, in many ways, a lot easier than the things in the first phase. We’ll see how that goes. I think they could. I want the farmers to come tell me, “Sir, we can’t produce that much.” But the farmers don’t know that language, right? We took it from $20, to potentially $50 billion. It’ll be more agricultural product will be bought than any time in our history by far. That’s on top of the Japan deal that we just made, where Japan is buying a tremendous amount of Ag and other things from our country, and our farmers. Our farmers have been great. They have never wavered. They said, ” The President is doing the right thing. We are sticking with the President.” I didn’t see any, they looked, some of the networks, the looked, they looked all over for somebody that could speak negatively about the President, and those farmers they stuck. They said, “Nope, he’s doing the right thing. It may be hurting us, but he’s doing the right thing.”  And I think in many ways the farmer, maybe, is going to be the biggest beneficiary of what we’re doing, certainly one of them. I think our country is going to be the biggest beneficiary. Secretary, could I ask you to talk a little bit about drug pricing, because we’ve cut it down a lot. We had the first year ever where prices actually went down. And if we had Democrat support we could get them way down, but we don’t have a lot of Democrat support. If you could talk about it, please. I’ve read for years that other countries have much lower drug prices than we do. I said to a couple of governors, including Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is very much into it, “Go to Canada, where the prices are 50%. Buy it from Canada. We’ll give you the approval.” And we’re working on those final approvals now. Canada buy, because of arcane rules, and because of protecting the middle men, and protecting drug companies, frankly, other countries have prices that are much, much lower, more than 50% in some cases. Canada’s pricing is much lower.  I told Ron DeSantis, I told other governors, “Go to Canada, go to other countries, buy them.” Same product, same exact manufacturer, many times, manufactured in the same plant, and a pill will cost you 50% less than it does in the United States. That just shows you how bad people have run our country. We’re going to get tremendous price cuts on drugs. We’re in the process, and I’d like you to speed that up, too, if you could. Really speed it up because Canada is loving to sell it. You can buy the exact same product for 50%. That means people are going to get a 50% reduction in drug prices.  In some cases substantially more. It’s hard to believe how this country was taken advantage of by, frankly, everybody in every different way. Thank you. I’d like to ask Gene Scalia to maybe speak. Gene is a highly respected gentleman, one of the best lawyers in the country focused on labor law. He’s not Department of Labor Secretary. It’s great to have you at our first meeting. Thank you, your first meeting, I’m very proud of you. He passed with a massive majority. What was the number? That’s considered a massive  probably the largest . Yeah we should do it. That’s a big thing on 401K that you’re doing. That’s very important, thank you. Kellyanne, you wanted to say about . Those are really incredible numbers, folks. I mean, you’re not going to report them, we’re just wasting our time. Those are great numbers. Thank you very much, Kellyanne. Take Back Day is a big deal. They’ve been talking about it for a long time, nobody’s every done it. But it is big. Alex wanted to mention just one additional thing? Something that some people think could be as big or bigger than healthcare is transparency. We’re doing transparency. Do you want to give just a one minute update on that transparency, and pricing, and transparency on the quality of your dollar? And just to end as our trade deals start kicking in, these trade deals are incredible. Whether it’s North Korea, South Korea… North Korea’s going to be… probably something’s going to be happening with North Korea, too, there’s some really interesting information on North Korea. A lot of things are going on, and it’s going to be a major rebuild at a certain point. South Korea is getting much more involved with us than we ever thought in terms of the economy, and in terms of the trade deal. A lot of money is being spent over there, they’re going to be doing it through us. They’ve been doing tremendous purchases.  We had a tremendous deficit with them, and we’re slowly eating away at these deficits. We had deficits with everybody. But as the trade deals start kicking in with China, especially phase one with the farmers, and with the banks, the banking system, financial services. As they start kicking in you’re going to see a tremendous difference in the economy. The economy is already, by far, number one. If I weren’t elected, by right now China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected, it was said by many people that China would right now. They were expecting around the second year of this term.  Not only aren’t they the biggest economy in the world, but they are way, way, way far away. We are much bigger than the China economy, and we’re getting bigger, and they’re not. Now, they have 1.4 billion people, I guess you’d call that an advantage. But we have an economy like no other. I think we have the strongest economy we’ve ever had. I think if you add the economy, the military, and all the other things that we’ve done, there’s nothing like it.  But when trade deals start kicking in, and as I said, the South Korea deal did kick in, and things are happening with that that are very positive. But as they kick in you’re going to see tremendous numbers, tremendous changes because the trade deals we had were so pathetic. They were so bad I used to sit back and say to  guys, “How did somebody actually negotiate these deals? How did they even negotiate them?” This was done at a level that it’s not even understandable why people were allowed to do it, why they were allowed, how did they get passed.  But we’re making great deals, and when they kick in the economy is good. As it’s been doing, I think, Larry, I can say that as good as it’s been doing, it’s going to be even better than that. Our country is doing fantastically well, perhaps better than every before. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much."
"Well, thank you very much. My fellow Americans I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East, it’s been a long time. Over the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria’s border has held and it’s held very well beyond most expectations. Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the ceasefire permanent and it will indeed be permanent.  However, you would also define the word permanent in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that, but I do believe it will be permanent. I’ve therefore instructed the secretary of the treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey’s original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria’s Northeast border region. So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we’re not happy with. This was an outcome created by us, the United States and nobody else, no other nation, very simple.  And we’re willing to take blame and we’re also willing to take credit. This is something they’ve been trying to do for many decades. Since then, others have come out to help and we welcome them to do so. Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help and we think that’s great. The nations and the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved. We’ve secured the oil and therefore a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we’re going to be protecting it and we’ll be deciding what we’re going to do with it in the future.  In any event, by the moves that we’ve made, we’re achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20 mile wide safe zone, an interesting term, safe zone. That’s the term we’re using. Hopefully that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years that has been sought for many decades and I think we have something that’s going to be strong and hold up. Turkey, Syria and all forms of the Kurds had been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service and we’ve done a great job for all of them and now we’re getting out, long time.  We were supposed to be there for 30 days, that was almost 10 years ago. So we’re there for 30 days and now we’re leaving. We’re supposed to be a very quick hit and let’s get out and it was a quick hit except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand. I want to thank vice president Pence and secretary of state Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago along with national security advisor O’Brien. I want to thank them very much.  The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended Kurdish fighters to safely leave. It just got them to a point where frankly it enabled them to get out to go and move really just a few miles in a slightly different direction. So this enabled them to do so. Countless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey, an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood. No injuries, nobody shot, nobody killed.  I have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the commander in chief of the SDF Kurds and he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done, could not have been more thankful. General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very strict lock and key and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out, a small number, relatively speaking and they’d been largely recaptured.  I’m also sure that he will be issuing his own statement very shortly. We had a great talk, but we’ve saved the lives of many Kurds, he understands that. The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long and I’m very happy to have been involved in it as are our vice president, our secretary of state and all of the other people in our team. By getting that ceasefire to stick, we’ve done something that’s very special. But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special.  Our troops are safe and the pain and suffering of the three day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short term outburst. Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, which I truly believe they will do, we reserve the right to reimpose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey.  We are now an economic powerhouse like never before and very importantly like no other. Our economic might is stronger than it’s ever been and our competitors are not doing very well. We also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS as a backup to the Kurds watching over them should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them. Further, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the US captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial.  Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time. Now is their chance to finally act. American forces defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years. We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort, they’ve been terrific. Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It’s their neighborhood. They have to maintain it, they have to take care of it.  There were some political pundants who responded to Turkey’s offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention. I don’t think so. But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey, a NATO ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdogan. The same people that I watched and read giving me in the United States advice were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years, they are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out.  They just talk. How many Americans must die in the middle East, in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts? After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course, one that leads to victory for America. Through much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn’t be done. Today’s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago was scorned and now people are saying, “What a great outcome. Congratulations.”  It’s too early to me to be congratulated, but we’ve done a good job. We’ve saved a lot of lives. Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could have led to disastrous, far reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could’ve been killed. The last administration said, “Assad must go.” They could have easily produced that outcome, but they didn’t. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand.  You all remember the red line in the sand when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks, eight long years after President Obama’s ill-fated push at regime change, US troops are still on the ground in Syria. More than half a million people are dead. Hundreds of thousands are terribly injured and millions more Syrians are displaced.  It really is a nightmare of misery. Across the Middle East we have seen anguish on a colossal scale. We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars, but after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded, so many. The Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began.  The same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores. But not anymore. My administration understands that immigration security is national security. As a candidate for president, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy.  One guided not by ideology, but by experience, history and a realistic understanding of the world. We are building up America’s military might like never before, investing two and a half trillion dollars since my election, but we will not be depleted. We will not happen again. It will not be allowed to happen again. Where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn’t be. When we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake. And when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory and a path out of conflict, that’s what we have to have.  We need a plan of victory, we will only win. Our whole basis has to be the right plan and then we will only win, nobody can beat us. I want to again, thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives along with President Erdogan of Turkey, a man I’ve gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country and in his mind he’s doing the right thing for his country and we may be meeting in the very near future.  I also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me, but me just as a representative of the United States. Because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds and we’re not talking in the long term. We’re talking in the short term, we’re talking something that was going on immediately and something frankly, that was planned for a long time. The job of our military is not to police the world. Other nations must step up and do their fair share that hasn’t taken place. Today’s breakthrough is a critical step in that direction. Thank you all very much, and God bless America. Thank you."
"Last night, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration.  US special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. The US personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi’s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.  The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. 11 young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate, and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS origins, future plans, things that we very much want.  Baghdadi’s demise demonstrates America’s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long. As you know, last month we announced that we recently killed Hamza bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama bin Laden, who was saying very bad things about people, about our country, about the world. He was the heir apparent to Al-Qaida. Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them. These savage monsters will not escape their fate and they will not escape the final judgment of God. Baghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office, but in my direction as Commander in Chief of the United States, we obliterated his caliphate 100% in March of this year.  Today’s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end. That also goes for other terrorist organizations. They are likewise in our sites. Baghdadi and the losers who worked for him, and losers they are. They had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases, they were very frightened puppies. In other cases, they were hardcore killers, but they killed many, many people. Their murder of innocent Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller were especially heinous. The shocking publicized murder of Jordanian pilot, a wonderful young man, spoke to the King of Jordan. They all knew him. They all loved him. He was burned alive in a cage for all to see, and the execution of Christians in Libya and Egypt as well as the genocidal mass murder of Yazidis rank ISIS among the most deprived organizations, the history of our world. The forced religious conversions, the orange suits prior to so many beheadings, all of which were openly displayed for the world to see. This was all that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, this is what he wanted. This is what he was proud of. He was a sick and depraved man, and now he’s gone. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way as a coward, running and crying.  This raid was impeccable and could only have taken place with the acknowledgement and help of certain other nations and people. I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. This was a very, very dangerous mission. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible. I want to thank the soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines involved in last night’s operation. You are the very best there is anywhere in the world, no matter where you go. There is nobody even close. I want to thank General Mark Milley and our joint chiefs of staff, and I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the missions. Unbelievable success.  Last night was a great night for the United States and for the world. A brutal killer one who has caused so much hardship and death has violently been eliminated. He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Thank you.  Any questions? We’ve had him under surveillance for a couple of weeks. We knew a little bit about where he was going, where he was heading. We had very good information that he was going to another location he didn’t go. Two or three efforts were canceled because he decided to change his mind, constantly changing his mind. And finally we saw that he was here, held up here. We knew something about the compound. We knew it had tunnels. The tunnels were dead end for the most part. There was one we think that wasn’t, but we had that covered, too, just in case. The level of intelligence, the level of work was was pretty amazing. When we landed with eight helicopters, a large crew of brilliant fighters ran out of those helicopters and blew holes into the side of the building, not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby trapped.  And there was something … it was something really amazing to see. I got to watch it along with General Milley, Vice President Pence, others in the situation room, and we watched it so clearly. Well, I don’t want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect as though you were watching a movie. It was a … that in the technology there alone is really great. A big part of the trip that was of great danger was the … it was approximately an hour and 10 minute flight and we were flying over very, very dangerous territory. In fact, some of our leaders said that that could be the most dangerous flying in and flying out, and that’s why last night we were so quiet about it. We didn’t say anything and I didn’t make my remark until after they had landed safely in a certain area. But the flight in, the flight out was a very, very dangerous part. There was a chance that we would have met unbelievable fire.  Russia treated us great. They opened up. We had to fly over certain Russia areas, Russia-held areas. Russia was great. Iraq was excellent. We really had a great cooperation, and you have to understand they didn’t know what we were doing and where we were going exactly, but the ISIS fighters are hated as much by Russia and some of these other countries as they are by us, and that’s why I say they should start doing a lot of the fighting now, and they’ll be able to. I really believe they’ll be able to. Yes, Jennifer. They gave us not a military role at all, but they gave us some information that turned out to be helpful, the Kurds. Who? Turkey, we dealt with them. They knew we were going in. We flew over some territory. They were terrific. No problem. They were not problem. They could start shooting and then we will take them out, but a lot of bad things can happen, plus it was a very secret mission. We flew very, very low and very, very fast.  But it was a big, it was a very dangerous part of the mission getting in and getting out, too. Equal. We went in in identical, we took an identical route. We met with gunfire coming in, but it was local gunfire. That gunfire was immediately terminated. These people are amazing. They had the gunfire terminated immediately, meaning they were shot from the airships. Well, I’ll tell you. The first day I came to office, and now we’re getting close to three years, I would say, “Where’s al-Baghdadi? I want al-Baghdadi.” And we would kill terrorist leaders, but they were names I’d never heard of. They were names that weren’t recognizable and they weren’t the big names. Some good ones, some important ones, but they weren’t the big names. I kept saying, “Where’s al-Baghdadi?” And a couple of weeks ago they were able to scope him out.  These people are very smart. They’re not into the use of cell phones anymore. They’re not … they’re very technically brilliant. They use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump, but they use the Internet incredibly well and what they’ve done with the Internet through recruiting and everything, and that’s why he died like a dog. He died like a coward. He was whimpering, screaming, and crying, and frankly I think it’s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries, including the United States, they should see how he died. He didn’t die a hero. He died a coward crying, whimpering, screaming, and bringing three kids with him to die. Certain death, and he knew the tunnel had no end. I mean, it was a closed … closed-end … they call it a closed-end tunnel. Not a good place to be. I’ve been looking for him for three years. I’ve been looking for him. I started getting some very positive feedback about a month ago, and we had some incredible intelligence officials that did a great job. That’s what they should be focused on that. Well, this operation started two weeks ago in terms of the real operation because we had him scoped. We thought he’d be in a certain location. He was. Things started checking out very well. We were involved in on our own team with some brilliant people who I’ve gotten to know, brilliant people that love our country, highly intelligent people, and we’ve had it pretty well scoped out for a couple of weeks, but he tends to change immediately. He had a lot of cash. He tends to change on a dime where he’ll be going to a certain location. All of a sudden he’ll go someplace else and you’ll have to cancel.  But this was one where we knew he was there, and you can never be 100% sure because you’re basing it on technology more than anything else. But we thought he was there and then we got a confirmation, and when we went in they were greeted with a lot of firepower, a lot of fire firepower. I’ll tell you, these guys, they do a job. They are so brave and so good, and so importantly, many of his people were killed and we’ll announce the exact number over the next 24 hours, but many were killed. We lost nobody. Think of that. It’s incredible. Our dog was hurt, actually. The canine was hurt. Went into the tunnel, but we lost nobody. We spoke to the Russians. We told them we’re coming in, and they said, “Thank you for telling us.” They were very good. No, they did not know why. No, I they did not know why. We did tell them, “We think you’re going to be very happy.” Because again, they hate ISIS as much as we do, you know what ISIS has done to Russia? So no, we did not tell. They did not know the mission, but they knew we were going over an area that they had a lot of firepower. We’ve notified some others are being notified now as I speak. We were going to notify them last night, but we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I’d never seen before. There’s no country in the world that leaks like we do and Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people we will not notify them until our great people are out. Not just in but out. I don’t want to have them greeted with a firepower like you wouldn’t believe. So we were able to get in. It was top secret, it was kept. There were no leaks, no nothing.  The only people that knew with a few people that I dealt with, and again, Mark Milley and the joint chiefs of staff were incredible. We had some tremendous back up. Robert O’Brien, Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo, Pence, I told you, he was great. There’s a very small group of people that knew about this. We had very, very few people. A leak could have caused the death of all of them. Now they’re so good that I think nothing was going to stop them anyway, you want to know the truth. That’s how good they were. We had them also surrounded by massive air power, up in the air yesterday, surrounded at very high levels. We were very low. We had tremendous air power. Secretary Esper, a few of the joint chiefs, Mark Milley, some generals. We had some very great military people in that room and we had some great intelligence people. Robert O’Brien, it’s really great. Yes. No, no. The pullout .. right sure, great question. And you’re doing a great job by the way. Your network is fantastic. They’re really doing a great job. Please let them know. No, the pullout had nothing to do with this. In fact, we found this out at a similar time. It’s a very good question because we found this out at a similar time. No, we’re after these leaders and we have others in sight, very bad ones. But this was the big one. This is the biggest one perhaps that we’ve ever captured. Because this is the one that built ISIS and beyond and was looking to rebuild it again, very, very strongly looking to build it again.  That’s why he went to this province. This is why he went to this area. You know, a lot of people, I was watching this morning and hearing and they said, “Why was he there?” People were so surprised. Well, that’s where he was trying to rebuild from because that was the place that made most sense if you’re looking to rebuild. Yeah. So I sent that right after I knew they had landed safely. Right and that was to notify you guys that you have something big this morning so you wouldn’t be out playing golf or tennis or otherwise being indisposed. I’d rather not say, but we landed in a very friendly port in a friendly country. No, I think it’s great. Look, we don’t want to keep soldiers between Syria and Turkey for the next 200 years. They’ve been fighting for hundreds of years. We’re out, but we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil and we may have to fight for the oil, that’s okay. Maybe somebody else wants the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight. But there’s massive amounts of oil and we’re securing it for a couple of reasons. Number one, it stops ISIS because ISIS got tremendous wealth from that oil. We have taken it, it’s secured. Number two, and again, somebody else may claim it, but either we’ll negotiate a deal with whoever’s claiming it if we think it’s fair or we will militarily stop them very quickly. We have tremendous power in that part of the world.  You know, the airport is right nearby, a very big, very monstrous, very powerful airport and very expensive airport that was built years ago. We’re in that Middle East now for eight trillion dollars. So we don’t want to be keeping Syria and Turkey. They’re going to have to make their own decision. The Kurds have worked along incredibly with us, but in all fairness, it was much easier dealing with the Kurds after they went through three days of fighting because that was a brutal three days. And if we would’ve said to the Kurds, “Hey, do you mind moving over seven miles?” Because they were in the middle mostly. So you have seven or eight miles. “Could you mind moving over?” Because I have to say Turkey is taken tremendous deaths from that part of the world. We call it a safe zone, but it was anything but a safe zone.  Turkey has lost thousands and thousands of people from that safe zone. So they’ve always wanted that safe zone for many years. I’m glad I was able to help them get it, but we don’t want to be there. We want to be home. I want our soldiers home or fighting something that’s meaningful. I’ll tell you who loves us being there, Russia and China. Because while they build their military, we’re depleting our military there. So Russia loves us being there. Now, Russia likes us big there for two reasons because we kill ISIS, we kill terrorists and they’re very close to Russia. We’re 8,000 miles away. Now, maybe they can get here. But we’ve done very well with Homeland Security and the ban, which by the way is approved by the United States Supreme Court, as you know. You know, there was a reporter that said we lost the case and he was right in the early court.  He didn’t want to say … just refused to say that we won the case in the Supreme Court. But we have a very effective ban and it’s very hard for people to come to our country, but it’s many thousands of miles away whereas Russia’s right there. Turkey’s right there, Syria is there. They’re all right there, excuse me, Iran is right there. Iraq is right there. They all hate ISIS. In theory they should do something and I’ll give you something else. The European nations have been a tremendous disappointment because I personally called, but my people called a lot. Take your ISIS fighters and they didn’t want them. They said, “We don’t want them.” They came from France, they came from Germany, they came from the U.K. They came from a lot of countries and I actually said to them, “If you don’t take them. I’m going to drop them right on your border and you can have fun capturing them again.”  But the United States taxpayer is not going to pay for the next 50 years. You see what Guantanamo costs? We’re not going to pay tens of billions of dollars because we were good enough to capture people that want to go back to Germany, France, U.K, and other parts of Europe. And they can walk back, they can’t walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them. So yeah, go. Well, I would but if I mentioned one, I have to mention so many. I spoke to Senator Richard Burr this morning and as you know, he’s very involved with intelligence and the committee and he’s a great gentleman. I spoke with Lindsey Graham just a little while ago. In fact, Lindsey Graham is right over here and he’s been very much involved in this subject. And he’s a very strong hawk, but I think Lindsey agrees with what we’re doing now. And again, there are plenty of other countries that can help them patrol. I don’t want to leave 1,000 or 2000 to 3000 soldiers on the border. But where Lindsey and I totally agree is the oil, the oil is so valuable for many reasons. It fueled ISIS, number one. Number two, it helps the Kurds because it’s basically been taken away from the Kurds. They were able to live with that oil. And number three, it can help us because we should be able to take some also.  And what I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with an Exxon Mobile or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly. Right now it’s not big. It’s big oil underground, but it’s not big oil up top and much of the machinery has been shot and dead. It’s been through wars. And spread out the wealth. But no, we’re protecting the oil. We’re securing the oil. Now that doesn’t mean we don’t make a deal at some point, but I don’t want to be … they’re fighting for a thousand years. They’re fighting for centuries. I want to bring our soldiers back home, but I do want to secure the oil. If you read about the history of Donald Trump, I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq and I was totally against it, but I always used to say, “If they’re going to go in,” nobody cared that much, but it got written about, “If they’re going to go in,” and I’m sure you’ve heard the statement because I made it more then any human being alive. “If they’re going into Iraq, keep the oil.”  They never did. They never did. I know Lindsay Graham had a bill where basically we would have been paid back for all of the billions of dollars that we’ve spent. Many, many billions of dollars. I mean, I hate to say it, it’s actually trillions of dollars, but many, many billions of dollars. And by one vote they were unable to get that approved in the Senate. They had some pretty big opposition from people that shouldn’t have opposed, like a president and they weren’t able. If you did that, Iraq would be a much different story today because they would be owing us a lot of money. They would be treating us much differently, but I will say Iraq was very good with respect to the raid last night. Well, I knew all about this for three days. Yeah. We thought for three days this is what was going to happen. It was actually, look, nobody was even hurt, a K-9 as they call, I call it a dog, a beautiful dog. A talented dog was injured and brought back. But we had no soldier injured and they did a lot of shooting and they did a lot of blasting. Even not going through the front door. You’d think, you go through the door. If you’re a normal person, you say, “Knock, knock, may I come in?” The fact is that they blasted their way into the house and a very heavy wall and it took them literally seconds. By the time those things went off, they had a beautiful big hole and they ran in and they got everybody by surprise. Unbelievably brilliant as fighters. I can’t imagine there could be anybody better. And these, as you know, are our top operations people. Well, we don’t know that, but he was the last one out and his people had either been killed, which there were many or gave up and came out. Because with the 11 children that came out, we were able to do that. We don’t know if they were his children. They might’ve been, but as I said, three died in the tunnel and the tunnel collapsed with the explosion. But you had other fighters coming out also and they’re being brought back. They’re right now … we have them imprisoned. Well, I started five o’clock, we were pretty much gathered at five o’clock yesterday. We were in contact all day long through hopefully secure phones. I’ll let you know tomorrow, but nothing seemed to leak, so I guess they were secure for a change. But we gathered more or less at 5:00. The attack started moments after that. The liftoff started moments after that. Again, the element of attack that they were most afraid of was getting from our base into that compound. Because there’s tremendous firepower that we were flying over. And I won’t go into it, but you had a very big Russian presence in one area. You had a Turkish presence, you had a Syrian presence and you’re flying low, it’s very dangerous. And there were shots made, but we think these were people that were shooting, that were indiscriminately shooting. The helicopters took some shots, but we think that these were people that were just random people that don’t like to see helicopters, I guess. So that’s another part of the genius of these people. They brought his … they have his DNA, more of it than they want even. And they brought it with them with lab technicians who were with them and they assumed that this was Baghdadi. They thought visually it was him, but they assumed it was him. And they did a site, an onsite test. They got samples. And to get to his body they had to remove a lot of debris because the tunnel had collapsed. But these people are very good at that. And they, as I said, they brought body parts back with them, et cetera. There wasn’t much left, the vest blew up, but they’re still substantial pieces that they brought back. So they did an onsite test because we had to know this and it was a very quick call that took place about 15 minutes after he was killed. And it was positive, “This is a confirmation, sir.” So there are two women, there were two women. Both wives, both wearing vests. They had not detonated, but the fact that they were dead and they had vests on made it very difficult for our men. Because they had vests on and it made it very difficult for our men because you’d never know what’s going to happen. They’re lying, they’re dead. They never detonated, but they were dead. Yeah, we know the successors and we’ve already got them in our sights and we’ll tell you that right now, but we know the successors. Hamza bin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country, a caliphate and was trying to do it again. And I had not heard too much about his health. I’ve heard stories about he may not have been in good health, but he died in a ruthless, vicious manner that I can tell you. Yes, we have people that were taken. Many of the people died on the site, but we had people that were taken yes. And the children, we left them under care of somebody that we understand. 11 children. I’d rather not say I’d leave that to the generals, but a small group.  With the generals, but a small group, more dead than alive. Many of them, and at the top level and people that were truly incredible at their craft. I’ve never seen anything like it. No, only American forces. Only American forces, but we were given great cooperation. We told the Russians we’re coming in, because we had to go over them, and they were curious, but we said we’re coming. We said one way or the other, hey, look, we’re coming. But they were very cooperative. They really were good. And we did say it would be a mission that they’d like, too, because you know, again, they hate ISIS as much as we do. So we had our own intel, we got very little help. We didn’t need very much help. We have some incredible people. When we use our intelligence correctly, what we can do is incredible. When we waste our time with intelligence, that hurts our country because we had poor leadership at the top, that’s not good.  But I’ve gotten to know many of the intel people and I will say that they are spectacular. Now, they’re not going to want to talk about it. They want to keep it quiet. The last thing they want, because these are great patriots. But the people that I’ve been dealing with are incredible people and it’s really a deserving name, intelligence.  I’ve dealt with some people that aren’t very intelligent having to do with intel, but this is the top people and it was incredible. It was flawless and it was very complicated, but… So I do appreciate Russia, Turkey, Iraq, and Syria to an extent, because you know, we’re flying into Syria. There’s a lot of Syrian people with lots of guns, so we had good cover for probably the most dangerous part.  It would not sound to, you know when you fly in, it doesn’t sound like that would be the most dangerous when you’re going into shooting nests and all of the things that happened once they broke into that pretty powerful compound. That was a very strong compound, and as I said had tunnels. But the most dangerous part we had great cooperation with.  Yes ma’am. No I didn’t. I didn’t do it. I didn’t do that. I wanted to make sure this kept secret. I don’t want to have men lost and women, I don’t want to have people lost. Oh yeah, they’ll be invited. I don’t know if they’ll want to have their faces shown to be honest with you. You know, they want to, they’re credible for the country. They’re not looking for public relations, but they love doing what they’re doing.  I’ve seen it. First lady was out there recently looking at what they do. She came back, she said, wow, I’ve never seen anything like that. The training, you know, all of the training and the power of the people, the men and women, the strength, the physical strength, the mental strength. These are incredible people. These are very unique individuals. I don’t want to talk about it- But he was screaming, crying, and whimpering, and he was scared out of his mind. And think of James Foley, think of , think of the things he did to Kayla, what he did to Foley and so many others. And for those people that say, oh, isn’t this a little violent? Think of how many times have you seen men, I think in all cases men for the most part, but in terms of this, where you see the orange suits and you see the ocean and they’re beheaded?  Or how many of you got to see, because it was out there, the Jordanian pilot whose plane went down, they captured him, they put him in a cage, and they set him on fire?  And the King of Jordan actually attacked very powerfully when that happened. They’ve never seen a thing like that, but he set him on fire. This was al-Baghdadi and you should never ever hopefully see a thing like that again.  Now, there’ll be new people emerge, but this was the worst, of this particular world, this was the worst, probably in certain ways, the smartest. He was also a coward and he didn’t want to die. But think of it, everybody was out and we were able to search him down and find him in the tunnel. We knew the tunnel existed and that’s where he was. Well, I don’t have a Syria pullout. I just don’t want to guard Turkey and Syria for the rest of our lives. I mean, I don’t want to do it. It’s very expensive. It’s very dangerous. They’ve been fighting for centuries. I don’t want to have my people, two thousand men and women, or a thousand, or 28… We had 28 guarding, I said, I don’t want them there anyway. I don’t want them.  Now, I will secure the oil, that happens to be in a certain part, but that’s tremendous money involved. I would love to, you know, the oil and… I mean, I’ll tell you a story in Iraq, so they spent… President Bush went in. I strongly disagreed with it even though it wasn’t my expertise at the time, but I had a, I have a very good instinct about things.  They went in and I said, that’s a tremendous mistake and there were no weapons of mass destruction. It turned out I was right. I was right for other reasons, but it turned out on top of everything else, they had no weapons of mass destruction. Because that would be a reason to go in, but they had none.  But I heard recently that Iraq over the last number of years actually discriminates against America in oil leases. In other words, some oil companies from other countries, after all we’ve done, have an advantage in Iraq for the oil.  I said, keep the oil, give them what they need, keep the oil. Why should we, we go in, we lose thousands of lives, spend trillions of dollars, and our companies don’t even have an advantage in getting the oil leases. So I just tell you that story. That’s what I heard. Yes. Everybody. Gina was great. Everybody played a role.   was great. Gina was great. They were all great. No. We were looking at this. Look, as I said, , I’ve been looking at this, I’m here almost three years. I’ve been looking at this for three years. They’d come in, sir, we have somebody under… I said, I don’t want somebody. I want al-Baghdadi. That’s the one I want.  They’d say, well we have somebody else. I said, that’s great, fine, take him out. But I wanted al-Baghdadi. That’s who I want. I don’t want other people.  And then I also wanted Hamza bin Laden. Because he’s a young man around 30, looks just like his father, tall, very handsome, and he was talking bad things just like his father.  Do you know if you read my book, there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down, and I don’t get any credit for this, but that’s okay, I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book, a really very successful book, and in that book about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, there is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out, something to that effect, he’s big trouble.  Now, I wasn’t in government, I was building buildings and doing what I did, but I always found it fascinating. But I saw this man, tall, handsome, very charismatic, making horrible statements about wanting to destroy our country, and I’m writing a book. I think I wrote 12 books, all did very well, and I’m writing a book. World Trade Center had not come down. I think it was about, if you check, it was about a year before the World Trade Center came down, and I’m saying to people, take out Osama bin Laden, that nobody ever heard of.  Nobody ever heard of. I mean, al-Baghdadi everybody hears because he’s built this monster for a long time, but nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until really the World Trade Center. But about a year, you’ll have to check it, a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, you have to kill him. You have to take him out.  Nobody listened to me. And to this day I get people coming up to me, they said, you know what one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center. It’s true.  Now most of the press doesn’t want to write that, but you know. But it is true, if you go back, look at my book, I think it was The America We Deserve, I made a prediction and I… Let’s put it this way, if they would’ve listened to me, a lot of things would’ve been different. Well, just death. I mean, you know I’m sending a large number of brilliant fighters. These are the greatest fighters in the world. I’d rather let the generals tell you, but a large number. We had eight helicopters and we had many other ships and planes. It was a large group. And again, this is a large group heading over very, very strong firepower areas where that was decision one, will they make it? And they made it. But they took fire, but they made it.  They didn’t take, we don’t believe, again, it was nation fire. We believe it was individual group fire or gang fires, they call it. So they made it. So that was a big relief.  Then they went in, they blasted their way in, you’ve heard. They blasted their way in so quickly. It was incredible, because this building was quite powerful, strong. They blasted their way in and then all hell broke loose. It’s incredible that nobody was killed or hurt. We had nobody even hurt, and that’s why the dog was so great.  We actually had a robot to go in the tunnel, but we didn’t get it because we were tracking him very closely. But we had a robot just in case because we were afraid he had a suicide vest on, and if you get close to him and he blows it up, you’re going to die. You’re going to die. He had a very powerful suicide vest. No, they had it, just incredible, we were getting full reports on literally a minute by minute basis. Sir, we just broke in, sir, the wall is down, sir, you know, we’ve captured, sir, two people are coming out right now, hands up fighters.  Then the 11 children out, numerous people were dead within the building that they killed. Then it turned out they gave us a report, sir, there’s only one person in the building. We are sure he’s in the tunnel trying to escape, but it’s a dead end tunnel.  And it was brutal, but it was over. And as I said, when he blew himself up, the tunnel collapsed on top of him on top of everything… And his children, I mean, so he led his three children to death. So, you know. The robot was set to, but we didn’t hook it up because we were too, they were moving too fast. We were moving fast. We weren’t 100% sure about the tunnel being dead ended.  It’s possible that there could have been an escape hatch somewhere along that we didn’t know about. So we moved very, very quickly. I mean- These people, they were moving. They were chasing. Yeah, they were chasing. But again, because the suicide vest, you can’t get too close. Again, one of the reasons with the wives is if they have a suicide vest, you know, you have to be very, very careful. These vests are brutal, brutal. And they go for a long distance. Yes, please. I’m calling the families now. It will be a pleasure to do that. The Foley family who I know, we will be calling Kayla’s family. What he did to her was incredible. It’s a well known story, and I’m not going to say it, but you know that he kept her in captivity for a long period of time. He kept her in his captivity, his personal captivity.  She was a beautiful woman, beautiful young woman, helped people. She was there to help people and he saw her and he thought she was beautiful and he brought her into captivity for a long period of time and then he killed her.  He was an animal, and he was a gutless animal. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it’s- A very great day for our country."
"I’m sorry. Well thank you very much. It’s great to be with President Macron of France, and we’ve had a very long relationship and a very good one. And we were just discussing certain things, and then we’d have a long conversation afterwards. First of all, before we begin, I want to pay my respects to the great warriors that you lost in Mali, 13 helicopters. It was sad. I’ve gotten a report on it. We talked about it, and please give my condolences to the families and to France, great fighters. You’ve done a fantastic job in that whole area. It’s a tough area, so we appreciate it very much.  We’ll be talking about a lot of things including NATO and including trade. We do a lot of trade with France, and we have a minor dispute. I think we’ll probably be able to work it out. But, we have a big trade relationship, and I’m sure that within a short period of time, things will be looking very rosy, we hope. That’s usually the case with the two of us. We get our work done. We’ve had a lot of cool things. We’ve done a lot of good things together as partners. Our countries have been partners in many good ventures including some having to do with radical Islam and others. It’s always worked out, so I look forward to our discussion.  We made a lot of progress in our first 25 minutes, and we intend to make a lot of progress in our next hour, maybe hour and a half. So, thank you very much. Well, we just began discussing NATO. And what I’m liking about NATO is that a lot of countries have stepped up, I think really at my behest and also yourself. You’re close to that level. They’ve stepped up, and they’ve put up a lot of money. I think it was 130 billion dollars, and that’s a lot. They’re not stepping up again. It’s going to be 400 billion dollars. But we are very sure we have commitments to 400 billion dollars. We just left the Secretary General, and he’s got some things that are very important, and discussed with him the flexibility so that we have it’s not just with one area of the world. You and I discuss this all the time. We have all areas of the world because NATO’s a lot different than it was, and now it’s certainly a lot different over the last three years. So, we have a lot of countries stepping up and putting up a lot of money. The number, as of this moment, is exactly 131 billion dollars. That’s a year, and that’s a tremendous amount of money, but it’s not enough. They also raised and have commitments for 400 billion dollars.  So, NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago is heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don’t think they could’ve gone on much longer. Now, it’s actually very strong and getting stronger. Many people are committed to that 2%, and ultimately, I think the 2% will be raised. The President and I, I think, feel that we need more flexibility. And I think we both agree on that so that we can use it for other things, not just looking at one specific country. A lot of people say it was meant to look at originally the Soviet Union, now Russia. But, we also have other things to look at, whether it’s radical Islamic terrorism, whether it’s the tremendous growth of China. There are a lot of other things.  NATO is becoming different than it was, much bigger than it was, and much stronger than it was because people are now fulfilling their commitments. There are some countries that aren’t fulfilling their commitment, and those countries are going to be dealt with. Maybe I’ll deal with them from a trade standpoint. Maybe I’ll deal with them in a different way. I’ll work something out where they have to pay, but we don’t wan to have people delinquent. I really don’t think it’s fair for us to be involved, including France, by the way, to be involved if you have countries that aren’t paying their way. They’re less than 1%. You have a couple that are less than 1%. Not fair.  NATO has made a lot of progress over the last three years, and the word flexibility is very important. They’re not just looking at one area now. They’re looking at the world, and it’s very important. To me, it’s very important.  Yes? Well, one thing I would also like to say that you’ve been really doing a great job in Africa, and you’ve been very much involved there, more than most. And that’s been fantastic. I appreciate you saying the United States for decades have been paying really way, way disproportionately too much, and you have other countries paying far too little that are very directly benefited by it and by the United States’ involvement. We’re changing that around somewhat, it’s important. But, we’re a very important player. I think without us, NATO certainly is not the same thing as we discussed, and discuss it at length. This morning, we discussed it with Secretary General Stoltenberg. But, we’re behind you 100%, and all of the money that’s been raised, and all of these countries that are all of a sudden putting up money, it’s a great thing to see.  But, we do have a great… We really have a different objective, I think, right now. We’re looking at a much bigger picture, and that includes… You mentioned Iraq, but it really includes Iran, too, I think. If you look at what’s going on in Iran, they have massive riots. They’re having protests all over the country, and they’re killing a lot of people. Everybody knows that. That’s why they turned off their internet system, so nobody can find out. But, if the media would go there, and I think it’s very hard for the media to go there, frankly, right now. But, they’re killing a lot of people.  But, NATO has come a long way in three years, and it’s something that we’re very proud of because we’re with them. NATO serves a fantastic function if everybody’s involved. If they’re not involved… And I really believe that the President is very much involved and likes the idea of NATO, but he wants it also to be utilized properly. If it’s not utilized properly, we all agree, right? That’s no good.  We’ve had a very good discussion. A lot of people, and we’re meeting with a lot of countries later, as you know. They’re really stepping up. For the most part, they’re all stepping up. We have one or two that aren’t, and we’ll have to deal with them in a different way. Maybe, as I said, we’ll deal with them on trade. We have a lot of power with respect to trade. They make a fortune with the United States, and then they don’t pay their bills. That’s no good. But NATO’s come a long way in three years, and it’s become very powerful, I think, very very powerful. It’s become, I think, a much fairer statement in terms of the United States because we’re able to go down a little bit.  We were paying four or 4.3% of the largest GDP ever. Nobody’s ever had a GDP like we have right now, and nobody’s come close. Other people were paying 1%. Some people were paying less than 1% of a very small GDP. It’s not fair. And they get it back. We protect them, but it’s not fair. So, a lot of changes have been made.  , go ahead. Right. Well, we’re working on that right now. We have discussed it. I think we’ll be able to work something out, I hope, and maybe not. Maybe we’ll do it through taxing. We could work it out easily through taxing. But, the American companies, the tech companies that you’re talking about, they aren’t my favorite people because they’re not exactly for me. But, that’s okay. I don’t care. They’re American companies, and we want to tax American companies. It’s important. We want to tax them. That’s not for somebody else to tax.  As the President knows, we tax wine, and we have other taxes scheduled. But, we’d rather not do that. But, that’s the way it would work. So, it’s either going to work out, or we’ll work out some mutually beneficial tax. And the tax will be substantial, and I’m not sure it’s going to come to that, but it might. Well, I haven’t asked that to the President today. I have over the period of time. We have a tremendous amount of captured ISIS fighters over in Syria, and they’re all under lock and key. But, many are from France, many are from Germany, and many are from the UK. They’re mostly from Europe, and some of the countries are agreeing… I have not spoken to the President about that. Would you like some nice ISIS fighters? I could give them to you. You can take every one you want. This is why he’s a great politician because that was one of the greatest non-answers I’ve ever heard, and that’s okay. France has actually taken back some fighters. But, we have a lot of fighters. We’ve captured a lot of people, and we have captured 100% of the caliphate. But, you know that that means they keep going and going. We sent a small contingent in, and we wiped out another portion of ISIS. We don’t want to happen to me what happened with President Obama, where it reformed, and then it became stronger than it was in the first place. So, we don’t want that to happen. As I said before, we’ve taken the oil. We have the oil, so we have total control of the oil so that they’re not going to be able to use it. They use that oil to really fuel up their wealth, to fuel up their money. That was a primary source of income.  And they get contributions, and we have now lists of where these contributions come from, which is very important. People contributed, if you can believe it. Some of these people are wealthy people that made contributions, and we have lists of… We learned a lot. When we got al-Baghdadi, that was a great get. And when we killed him, we have a lot of information that I’m revealing now for the first time. But, we also got a lot of good information. A lot of things are happening, and France has been very helpful. I have to say that they’ve been very very helpful. Okay.  Go ahead. Any other questions, please? I largely agree with that answer. I just have to say that I came into a position, where the European Union was making anywhere from 100 to 150 billion dollars a year in deficits to the United States. They were making it. We were losing it, so we had to do something that is fair, not severe. I think fair. We’re losing tremendous amounts of money. As you know, the European Union is very strong on barriers. Barriers meaning certain of our products can’t come in, including agriculture product. It just can’t come in. We can’t sell it, and yet the European Union sells openly to the United States and generally untaxed or taxed at a low level. So, these are problems that we’re talking about. These are problems that we’re working out, and the digital tax is the least of it.  I inherited a situation where the European Union, which was formed partially for this reason. I guess for a lot of reasons, it was formed, but partially to make better or take advantage of the United States. They’ve done that very brilliantly, and frankly, it’s not right. So, I’ve exposed it. A lot of people didn’t know it, and we’re doing things about it. We have no choice because the United States can’t continue to lose the kind of money that they’ve lost literally since the formation of the European Union. And I think we’ll work something out. They want to talk, as you know. The new head wants to talk, who is supposed to be a very respected woman, very highly respected, and I look forward to meeting her. They want to meet.  But, we have a very unfair trade situation, where the US loses a lot of money for many, many years with the European Union, billions and billions of dollars. To be specific, over 150 billion dollars a year. So, we don’t want to be doing that, and we can make a deal, or we could take a harsh approach. We could solve that problem instantaneously, if we wanted to. But, I don’t want to do that. These are friends of ours. These are people that we’ve had very extraordinary relationships with, and I do personally. And I’m sure we can work something out. I don’t want to comment on that, but the answer is no. But, I don’t want to comment on that. Well, I can only say we have a very good relationship with Turkey, and with President Erdogan, I do. I can’t speak for the President of France. We have a very good relationship. We pulled our soldiers out and we said, “You can patrol your own border now. I don’t care who you do it with, but we’re not going to have soldiers patrolling the border that’s been fought over for 2,000 years.” But, we took our soldiers out. We put some of the soldiers around the area where we’ve captured the oil and taken the oil, and we have the oil. And we’ve brought some home, and we will be bringing some home, and we’ve sent some to other areas. But, we have a very good relationship with Turkey. This is really why we’re having meetings. Those are our points, and we’ll be discussing that with the President today. Yes? We’re looking at it now, and we’re talking about it now. As you know, Turkey wanted to buy our Patriot system, and the Obama administration wouldn’t let them. They only let them when they were ready to buy another system, which is not the same system. But, Turkey, for a long period of time, wanted very much to buy the Patriot system, which is our system, which is what NATO uses, which is a great system, which is the best system. They wouldn’t sell it to Turkey. So, there are two sides of the story. I have to say this. But, we will be discussing that with Turkey in a little while. We’ll be meeting with Turkey in a little while, and also tomorrow.  . Are you talking about Ambassador…. Oh, I thought you meant Woody Johnson. I said, “Boy, he’s really risen rapidly.” Woody. Where is Woody? Is he here? He’s not here. This is his house. I can’t believe he’s not here.  Yes, we’ll be meeting with Prime Minister Johnson in a little while. I’ll be seeing him later on. We’re going over to number 10, which is a very exciting place to be, as you know. And we’ll be discussing a lot of different things. Yes. No. I don’t have a comment on the London Bridge attack, other than to say that I was very proud of those people that grabbed them and did such a good job between the fire extinguishers and whatever else. It was an amazing job they did, and he was very violent. You could see that. I mean this was captured very much on tape. I think they were British citizens. The way they stepped up was incredible. That was really great. So, a terrible thing, a terrible attack. A lot of people very badly hurt. I believe three or four killed. Is it four now today? So, it’s terrible. It’s a terrible thing, and I know it’s an act of terrorism. It’s been declared an act of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism, by the way. And it’s very bad, very bad. But, I think the way they stepped up, to me, that was something very special. Okay? I don’t think he does feel that. I think we get along with Russia. I think we could get along with Russia. I think you feel we can get along with Russia. We’ve discussed that before. But, certainly we have to be prepared. Whether it’s Russia or somebody else, we have to be prepared. But, you and I have a pretty similar view on that. I think we feel that we can get along with Russia, and I think it’s a good thing to get along with Russia. I campaigned on it, when I go into big stadiums, people like it. And, I think the Russian people would like to see it, too. A lot of good can come out of it. But, the purpose of NATO is that, but the purpose of NATO can be much more. And that’s where we’ve shown the flexibility over the last period of two years. And I think the situation in Ukraine is very important. I think that the meetings coming up with Russia and Ukraine are very important. There is a possibility that some very big progress can be made. It’s very important for Ukraine. I think it’s very important from the standpoint of Russia, also, that they work out a treaty, they work out peace because they’ve been fighting a long time, too long. I think there’s a really good chance that that will happen. Also, with respect to nuclear weapons, I’ve spoken to President Putin, and I’ve communicated with him, and he very much wants to and so do we, work out a treaty of some kind on nuclear weapons. That will probably then include China at some point, and yourselves, by the way. But, it will include China and some other countries. But, we intend to see if we can work something out to stop the proliferation, to stop what’s happening because we are making a lot, and we are renovating a lot.  And frankly, the whole situation with nuclear is not a good situation. We ended the treaty because it wasn’t being adhered to by the other side. But, they want to make a treaty, and so do we, and I think it would be a great thing. I think it’s one of the most important things we can do, frankly. So, we’re going to be dealing with Russia on a treaty where we really… And we’re focused on nuclear and nuclear weapons, missiles, and nuclear weapons. And we think something can be worked out. We think they want to do it. We know they want to do it, and we want to do it, also.  I’ve spoke to China about it. During one of our trade negotiations, they were extremely excited about getting involved in that. So, some very good things can happen with respect to that. I think it’s very important. The whole nuclear situation, very very important.  .  Thank you all very much. Thank you.  .   these people again.  .  (silence)."
"As long as I’m president of the United States Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Good morning. I’m pleased to inform you, the American people should be extremely grateful and happy. No Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe,, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.  I salute the incredible skill and courage of America’s men and women in uniform. For far too long, all the way back to 1979 to be exact, nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive, and destabilizing behavior in the middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Quasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.  He trained terrorists armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil Wars all across the region. He viciously wounded, and murdered thousands of US troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that may him and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on US personnel in Iraq, that badly wounded for service members, and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the US Embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.  Soleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists. If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes it’s behavior. In recent months alone Iran’s sea ships in international waters fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down to US drones. Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted death to America.  In fact, they chanted death to America the day the agreement was signed. Then Iran went on a terrorist spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us, and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country. Even recently killing 1500 people, at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives a ran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.  Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA, and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer, and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as the Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred and war. The civilized world, must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime. Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward.  Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years. Under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before, and America’s achieved energy independence. These historic accomplishments shades our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible, and options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of two point $5 trillion. US armed forces are stronger than ever before.  Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. Under construction, are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military, and economic is the best deterrent. Three months ago after destroying 100% of ISIS, and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi who is responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.  ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve. One of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."
"Unemployment rates among African American, Hispanic American, Asian Americans has reached a record low in the history of our country, the lowest. African American youth unemployment has reached the lowest in the history of our country. So proud of that. African American poverty numbers have plummeted to their lowest rate ever recorded, doing really well. Unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in almost 70 years, and the veterans’ unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached its all time record low, also. These are incredible numbers . Workers without a high school diploma have received the and achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever in recorded history. That’s so important, without a high school diploma. We have a lot of great people that don’t have a high school diploma. We have record low unemployment. A record number of young Americans are now employed.  We have the highest number of people working in our country that we’ve ever had before. We’ve never had anything even close. We’re almost up to 160 million, and we’ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and you know all about food stamps. We talk about it all the time, but millions and millions of people don’t need food stamps anymore. Sad that we’ve lifted them off, which we have, but they don’t need them anymore. They have jobs. They’re doing really well.  The U.S. stock markets have soared, and they’ve reached the highest point that they’ve ever, ever had. We’ve made at least $19 trillion in terms of wealth, in terms of wealth creation for our country beyond the stock markets, and we are now, by far, the biggest economy in the world. China would have caught us. They were getting very close. It was anticipated that in 2019 … This is for many years. I’m not telling any secrets, that by 2019, China would become the largest economy in the world. Right now, we’re much larger, but we have a great new deal with China, great deal.  We have, I would say, our best relationship that we’ve ever had with China on top of everything else, and we’re starting phase two. Phase one turned out to be much bigger than we anticipated because we have intellectual property protections, we have many of the financial deals and aspects of the financial deals that we wanted we got done, and other things, in addition to the farmers. We’ve got the total complete package for the farmers. We estimate that it’ll be anywhere between 40 and $50 billion. The number I think is going to be closer to 50 billion. The most they’ve ever done is 16, so we go from 16 to anywhere from 40 to 50 billion that they’ll be purchasing.  We’re an economic powerhouse like, actually, we’ve never been. Jobs, factories, companies are pouring back into the United States. That’s one of the reasons I’ve been in Davos is we have had conversations with other leaders of other countries where we’ve traditionally had tremendous deficits. I say, “You have to move factories and plants back here.” They took a lot of them. They actually took a lot of them, and now they’re going to move them back. They’re not going to move them back. The companies are coming back because everybody wants to be here, but the countries also understand that we have to balance out our trade, and we’re doing incredibly well in that way.  One of the people that was very important for me to meet from the World Trade Organization is Roberto Azevedo, and he is a highly respected man. He happens to be this gentleman right here. I thought I’d have him say a few words, but the World Trade Organization is … I’ve had a dispute running with them for quite a while because our country hasn’t been treated fairly.  China’s viewed as a developing nation. India is viewed as a developing nation. We’re not viewed as a developing nation. As far as I’m concerned, we’re a developing nation, too, but they got tremendous advantages by the fact that they were considered developing, and we weren’t, and they shouldn’t be, but if they are, we are, and we’re talking about a whole new structure for the deal, or we’ll have to do something, but the World Trade Organization’s been very unfair to the United States for many, many years, and without it, China wouldn’t be China. China wouldn’t be where they are right now. That was the vehicle that they used, and I give them great credit, and I also don’t give the people that were in my position great credit because, frankly, they let that all happen, but the vehicle was the World Trade Organization.  Roberto and I have a tremendous relationship, and we’re going to do something that I think will be very dramatic. He’ll be coming with a lot of his representatives to Washington sometime, maybe next week or the week after, and we’ll start working on it. I’d like to introduce just for briefly Roberto and say a few words on behalf of the WTO, and then I’m going to introduce Larry Kudlow to say exactly where we are in terms of our economy. Some of you know, but we’ve had some tremendous numbers just over the very recent past. So please, Roberto. Thank you very much. Great. Larry, please, Larry Kudlow. Thank you very much, Larry. I mean, when you think that soon, it’ll start pretty soon, it’s already started to a certain extent, I asked him to do it, china is going to be purchasing more than $250 billion worth of goods from our country. That’s massive. Those are numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, and that number can grow. It can grow with time. It’s going to grow substantially, I predict. Then, you have the USMCA, Mexico, Canada, and that’s massive numbers we’re talking about there. We made a deal with Japan, $40 billion, and we made a deal with South Korea. That’s a tremendous deal, also. That was a horrible deal. We turned it into a really good deal. It was really something.  While we were in Davos, most of you know this, we met with the world leaders, various world leaders, including the President of the European Commission, who we’re going to start negotiating a trade deal with, because the European commission was, frankly, in many ways, tougher than China. I say that respectfully, but that’s the way it is. They’ve taken advantage for a long time, and so we’re going to have a deal. I suspect we’re going to be able to make a deal. Otherwise, we’ll have to do something else. I think they’re going to make a deal. They haven’t wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they’re going to negotiate with me. The President of the Swiss Confederation, who’s been very nice and terrific, the President of Kurdistan, we had a tremendous meeting along, with President Salih of Iraq, the Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, and President Ghani of Afghanistan. In addition, we met with many of the business leaders both at breakfast today and lunch yesterday and dinner yesterday. Many of you were at those meetings at least for a little while, and tremendous numbers of jobs will be coming into the United States. A lot of these leaders, these are the biggest business leaders in the world, and this morning was very inspirational. I mean, these companies are really going to expand, and it was a request of mine, but what we did, we’ve been very good to them. They’re all doing very well, and we have companies from Europe, companies from Asia now coming to the United States. “That’s where the action is,” as one of them said, ” that’s where the action is.” It’s really been great. Now, we’ll be going. We’ll be leaving and going back to Washington. Yes? Go ahead. Well, I’ll tell you the way I look at it. It’s a total hoax. It’s a disgrace. They talked about their tremendous case, and it’s all done, their tremendous case. They had no case. It’s all a hoax. It’s a con job, like Schiff. He’s a corrupt politician. Now, I’ll leave that to the Senate. The Senate is going to have to answer that. I have great respect for the Senate as a body, and many of the individuals I have great respect, so I’ll leave that to the Senate, but this is the greatest witch hunt.  This started from the day I came down with the future First Lady. The day we came down the escalator, this started, and I watched the … They’ve been driven crazy. You know what’s driven them crazy? All of these record numbers on unemployment, African American, Asian American. You take a look. Hispanic American is numbers that nobody’s even believing. They are looking at all of this. They’re looking at this tremendous success, the likes of which they’ve never seen before in this country. They’ve never seen anything like this, and it’s driven the Democrats crazy. As Congressman Green said, Al Green, he’s a beauty. As Congressman green said, “We got to beat him by impeachment because we can’t beat him in the election.” I hope that’s-  … Because we can’t beat them in the election. And I hope that’s true, because honestly, they can’t beat me in the election. I don’t think they can. I know what I’ll be running against one way or the other. It’s one of them and I think we’re going to do very well, but I think we’re going to do well because nobody’s done in the first three years, less than three years, because a lot of these numbers were taken from two months ago. They ended two months ago. In less than three years, nobody’s done the kind of numbers we’ve done. So I’m going to head back and I’ll be watching it, but it’s really going to be up to the Senate. We’re going to have them make that determination. Please.  Please. I didn’t say anger, I said anger management. How old is she? That’s good. She beat me out on Time Magazine. No, I didn’t actually. But I would’ve loved to have seen her speak. I did  not. No, not at all. I think what is … I think aspects of it are, I think that some people are … They put it at a level that is unrealistic, to a point you can’t live your lives. We want to have the cleanest water on earth. We want to have the cleanest air on earth. Our numbers, as you saw, we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good. Our environmental numbers, our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous. We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. When we’re clean and beautiful and everything’s good, but you have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can’t believe. I mean, I think Greta ought to focus on those places, but we are doing better right now than we’ve ever done in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean with thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that’s put there by other countries. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries. By the way, congratulations on your show. They made a very wise decision. Oh, good. Well, you got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you, there’s nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine and it was based on that. People don’t even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time in Washington. And I watched … They don’t talk about my conversation. They don’t talk about my transcripts.  Remember this, when Schiff made up the phony story and he repeated it to Congress and the world and it was a totally phony story. Then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was … Wait, wait. Otherwise, I won’t do your show. Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared and when they saw this transcript they said, “We got problems.” But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony concocted story made up. So here’s the story. Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate.  The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a sign off. There was nothing wrong. They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn’t think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped, but they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats. Because they say, “Wait a minute, this is much different than Shifty-Schiff told us.” So we’re doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don’t have the material. Well, it depends. But if you take a look at this, and from what everybody tells me, all I do is I’m honest. I make great deals. I’ve made great deals for our country. Now we’re working with the WTO. You’re probably surprised by that, but there’s been a longterm abusive situation to the US. I make great deals for our country and they’re honest deals. And when you read that transcription … And by the way, it wasn’t one call. It was two calls. Nobody likes to talk about that. There was one call, which was perfect. And then there was a second call, I guess a couple of months later, which was perfect.  The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good. Now here’s the other thing, they got their money long before a schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says, it’s very important to me, why isn’t Germany paying, why isn’t UK paying? Why isn’t France paying? Why aren’t the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker United States? That’s one. And the other thing I wanted to check very carefully and it’s very important is corruption. And we do that too. This was a perfect call and I think we’re doing very well. We are discussing it already, yes. We would like to see if we can do something. But again, we’re doing a trade deal and it’s a very big deal. Phase one is done. Phase two is being discussed. We are discussing aspects of your question, yes. No, . I can live either way. I can live … I’ll tell you what I think, it’s such a hoax. I think it’s so bad for our country when we have the head of the World Trade Organization here and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect that nobody talks about. I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call because there’s nothing to say. You read it. Somebody should just sit there and read it and everybody’s going to say, “You mean that’s an impeachable event?” If that were impeachable, Lyndon Johnson would have had to leave office on his first day. Kennedy would’ve had to leave office his first day. It’s a hoax and you understand it’s a hoax better than anybody. It’s a hoax and that’s the way it is. Yeah. Go ahead. No. I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report it is not very serious, not very serious. They told me about it numerous days later. You’d have to ask Department of Defense. No, I don’t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I’ve seen. I’ve seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our trips. I’ve seen people with no legs and with no arms. I’ve seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war. In fact, many cases put those bombs, put there by Soleimani who’s no longer with us. I consider them to be really bad injuries. No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no. Yeah. I have a timeline … Yeah. Yeah, great question, actually. I don’t have a timeline, but maybe I do in my own mind. They have to move relatively quickly, but they have to treat us fairly. The European Union was formed pretty much for this reason, I suspect, if you really think about it. Why was it formed? They formed their airplane company, which does very nicely and now is doing better than ever because Boeing has not had a good time of it. They better start recovering fast. I hope they do. They have some good people in there now. They have great people in the company, but they have some good people leading it now. So hopefully, that’ll be taken care of. But, no. I have a date in my mind and it’s a fairly quick date and if we’re unable to make a deal, then we’ll do even better. We’ll do even better.   But they haven’t treated us right. Look, the United States has been losing 150 billion and more for many years. 150 billion, more. I mean, really, more than that with the European Union. They have trade barriers where you can’t trade. They have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible. They are frankly more difficult to do business with then China. We have a great relationship with China now. We had some testy moments, very testing, beyond testy. Worse than a lot of people would understand, but we got it done and I think phase two will go nicely also. But with the European Union, and frankly I’ll be honest, I wanted to wait until I finished China before I went to work on respectfully Europe. But Europe is so beautiful. I guess a lot of us come indirectly from Europe. Isn’t that nice? But they are actually more difficult to do business with than China.  All you have to do is ask Boris, but I think Boris is going to be okay too. I think he’s going to come out great. I think he had a lot of guts. He’s done a terrific job. I think he’s in a good position, which they would’ve never been able to do before Boris. I have a date. I have a very specific date in my mind. Before. I think we’ll have a deal before. Yeah, I think so. They have to do that. I mean, I don’t want to … Look, I’m not saying it from strength or from weakness. I’m just saying they have to do it. They wanted to make a deal. Our nation, our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to them and then they said, “No, no, we like it the way it is.” Of course, they like it the way it is. They’re making 150 billion-plus. Right? And as you know, President Bush was desperate to make a deal. They wouldn’t even talk to him. Me, they’re talking to and we’ll have a deal. If we don’t have a deal, we’ll do even better.  Yes, . Yes. We have a travel ban. It’s a very powerful ban and a lot of … I heard a reporter recently say he lost the ban in court. They didn’t say that we won it in the Supreme Court. I’d say that’s a little deceptive, John, wouldn’t you? He said he lost the travel ban. I didn’t lose the travel ban. The travel ban was lost in the lower courts and won in the Supreme Court two years ago. No, we are. We’re adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what’s going on in the world. Our country has to be safe, so we have a very strong travel ban and we’ll be adding a few countries to it. It’s going to be announced very shortly, okay?  John? . Yeah, John. Well, you’re asking a lot of questions. First of all, Jerry Nadler, I’ve known him a long time. He’s a sleazebag. Everybody knows that. Pat Cipollone is a high quality human being. I was very impressed with Pat. He had great emotion yesterday. Pat’s a brilliant guy, but I’ve never seen that emotion and that’s real emotion. That’s because he knows this is a hoax. And I was very proud of the job he did. I’ve known Jerry Nadler for a long time. He’s opposed many of my jobs. I got them all built, very successfully built in New York. So we have yet another fight. Isn’t it amazing? Isn’t it surprising? Isn’t it amazing? But if you look at other aspects or other parts of your question, I think that the … I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people. The problem with John is that it’s a national security problem. You can’t-  … and is that it’s a national security problem. You can’t have somebody who’s at national security and if you think about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it’s not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country? It’s going to be very hard. It’s going to make the job very hard. He knows other things. And I don’t know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not. And so you don’t like people testifying when they didn’t leave on good terms, and that was due to me, not due to him. And so we’ll see what happens. But when you have a national security, you could call it presidential prerogative, you could just call it the way I look at it, I call it national security for national security reasons. Executive privilege, they say.  So, John would certainly fit into that. When you’re a national security advisor, like this gentleman is doing a fantastic job, Robert. I just think it’s very hard and I’ve always gotten along. I’ve actually gotten along with John Bolton. He didn’t get along with other people, a lot of other people. But when he knows my thoughts on certain people and other governments, and we’re talking about massive trade deals and war and peace and all these different things that we talk about, that’s really a very important national security problem. I think having somebody, other people … Mick Mulvaney is probably around here someplace. I’d love to have Mick go, but I think that he’s really expressed himself very well when he did a Chris Wallace interview. That was a very, very powerful interview. That was a long, tough … Chris is a tough interviewer, a very talented guy. I think it’s not much he can add. He’s been great.  I’ll tell you what I don’t like though. I’d love to have Mike Pompeo testify, but again, that’s a national security problem. But I’d love to have Mike Pompeo, but it’s a national security problem. I’d love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me, “I’d love to testify. Please let me testify,” because he knows this is all a hoax. He understands it better than most. And Rick Perry would love to testify, but we’re dealing with national security. We’re dealing with one other thing. Our country has been tied up with this hoax from the day I came down the escalator. We’ve been fighting it. I’ve been fighting it from the day I’ve been elected. I would say probably long before. It could be long before I came down the escalator that some people have said that, which is hard to believe … Wait John. It’s hard to believe we’ve been fighting this.  Personally, I’d rather go the long route. It’s horrible for our country. Our country has to get back to business. We have people that are corrupt, like Adam Schiff, who misquotes … I don’t mean misquotes. Makes up a statement. He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I’d do that. And for that I thank the president of Ukraine because we got their approval. He had no idea I was going to do that. But these are corrupt people, some of them. And some of them are just playing the political game. But if you look at the poll numbers, my poll numbers are the highest they’ve ever been. If you look at the funding numbers, if you look at what the money raised by the Republican party has just set a record. Nobody’s ever done this before. It’s because of the impeachment hoax. Three? That means six. Six for the family. Go ahead. No, go ahead. He’s a con man. Ready, let me answer that one. I don’t know him. Other than he’s like a groupie. He shows up at fundraisers. So I don’t know anything about him. I watched Rudy. Rudy is a terrific person, great crime fighter, the best mayor in the history of New York City by far. Solved the crime problem in New York. And I think it’s very unfair the way the media has treated Rudy Giuliani. I will say this. Parnas I don’t know other than he probably contributed to the campaign along with tens of thousands of other people. And I mean I was this weekend, I was taking pictures with hundreds of people. They contribute to the Republican party and I stand there and I take pictures and every once in a while I’ll look at somebody, I say, “Gee, I wonder when that picture is going to be in the New York Times or the Washington Post or on Fox.” So it’s one of those things. I think Rudy is a high quality person. I don’t want there to be a conflict. I’d love to have Rudy on my team, but he could be a witness at some point if this whole sham continues. I would love to have Rudy on the team. Rudy is on my team, just so you understand, but I’d love to have him up there. But it could be that he’d have a conflict. It could be. But Rudy Giuliani is somebody that, I think the press has been very unfair to. Greatest mayor in the history of New York. Think of it. And one of the greatest crime fighters of the last hundred years. And he hates to see what’s happening because he knows corruption really better than anybody. Okay. Go ahead. So, Ken Starr is a terrific man. I did make that statement because frankly I didn’t think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I thought it was terrible. I didn’t know Ken Starr, but I didn’t think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I was pretty vocal about that. I didn’t know Ken, but what I did know is he was very smart. He was very tough. He was very talented. But in a certain way I was sticking up for Bill Clinton. I sort of still feel that way. I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things, a lot of bad things. Now with me, there’s no lying. There’s no nothing. They have nothing. They don’t even have a crime. They say this is the only one that’s ever been impeached and he didn’t commit a crime. I didn’t commit a crime. And then you get into high crimes and misdemeanors, but I didn’t commit a crime. So no, I have great respect for Ken, but I didn’t think, frankly that Bill Clinton should’ve been impeached. I’d love to go. Wouldn’t that be great? Wouldn’t that be beautiful? I don’t know. I’d sort of love sit right in the front row and stare in their corrupt faces. I’d love to do it. I don’t know. Don’t keep talking because you may convince me to do it. I think they might have a problem. I think they might. And by the way, I think they’ve done a really good job. And I think the other side has so lied. I watch the lies from Adam Schiff. He’ll stand, he’ll look at a microphone and he’ll talk like he’s so aggrieved. These two guys, these are major sleazebags. They’re very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people. When somebody will make up a statement that I made, when you remember the statement, eight times quid pro quo, eight times, think of it. How can you say eight times? That would mean I was asking somebody eight different times for the same thing. What kind of a conversation would that be? If you asked once, that’d be fine. If you asked twice, that’d be … How can you ask eight times? They would say you’re a loony tune. Right? And then he said, I think he finished by saying, “Don’t call me. I’ll call you,” that I said that. He made that statement. “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.” And he didn’t say he made it up.  Now ultimately he had to, in a sense, apologize. He can hardly apologize, but he had to apologize because fortunately we had a tape. We had the transcripts. I am so happy that I had the transcripts because it showed he’s a liar and he’s a fraud and they continue to just go on and on. But this has happened to me with the Russian hoax. This has happened to me, I called it the witch hunt, greatest witch hunt in American history, and the Mueller report, which exonerated totally. There was no collusion after all that. Two years, there was no collusion. And then what happened to Jill Stein from the Green Party gets called a Russian agent by crooked Hillary and then Tulsi Gabbard. I don’t know either of them, but I know they’re not Russian agents. Gets called a Russian agent. This is what these people do. They demean, and the press plays in because the press largely is their partner.  And one thing, if we could straighten out the press in our country, we would have a place that would be so incredible. The press is so dishonest, so corrupt. I read it all the time. Stories. I don’t mind bad stories. I deserve bad stories sometimes, but when I do something great or good, let it be written about good. Same thing with other people. The corruption in the media, as I call it the fake news media, is unbelievable. And hopefully everybody’s going to learn a lesson. People got Pulitzer Prizes for their coverage of me, and it turned out they were totally wrong. Other people, Sean Hannity, Rushbo, a lot of great people, a lot of great writers, they got it right. They didn’t get Pulitzer Prizes, but they got it right. The Russian hoax was a terrible thing. The dossier was a phony deal paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC and used in the Pfizer coup. It’s totally illegally. No, it’s a terrible thing that happened. This was a take down attempt at a sitting president of the United States, and we caught them. So let’s see what happens. No, I don’t see. A very excellent writer, Bob Woodward, I guess he’s doing another book on Trump, but this time I’ll actually give him an interview. He said, “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” I said, “No, I’m not enjoying it.” He said, “No, you act like you’re winning and you won. You’re actually enjoying it.” I said, “I’m not enjoying it. I’m doing it because it’s very important what I’m doing.” I consider what I’ve done here with this whole witch hunt from day one with the insurance policy, with the horrible statements made between Strzok and Page and McCabe and Comey, who lied to Congress and did so many other bad things. He lied and he leaked. When I finish, I think that this is going to go down as one of the greatest things I’ve done for our country. These are bad, corrupt people. These are bad people, and very bad for our country. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you."
"Well, thank you very much and thank you Jeanie. It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life. We’re here for a very simple reason, to defend the right of every child born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential. For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life. And today as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you. I want to welcome tens of thousands. This is a tremendous turnout. Tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides to be here in our Nation’s Capitol.  And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in. If anybody would like to give up their spot, we can work that out. We have a tremendous group of people outside, thousands and thousands wanting to get in. This is some great success. Young people are the heart of the March for Life and it’s your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation. The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens.  You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer and motivated by pure, unselfish love. You are grateful and we are so grateful. These are incredible people. To be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway. Thank you. And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here. James, Mike. Thank you, fellows. And Representatives, Steve Scalise, Chris Smith, Ralph Abraham, Warren Davidson, Bob Latta, John Joyce, Lloyd Smucker, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Brad Wenstrup. Thank you all. And I have to say, and I look at it, I see it exactly. We have many, many more politicians in the audience. But if you don’t mind, I won’t introduce them all.  All of us here today understand an eternal truth, every child is a precious and sacred gift from God. Together we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and the sanctity of every human life. When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God’s creation. When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul. One life changes the world. From my family, and I can tell you I send love and I send great, great love. And from the first day in office, I’ve taken historic action to support America’s families and to protect the unborn.  And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of title 10 taxpayer funding. I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life. At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. And as the Bible tells us, each person is wonderfully made. We’ve taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty. So important. Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world and frankly very strongly attacked in our nation.  You see it better than anyone, but we are stopping it and we’re taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are preserving faith-based adoption and to uphold our founding documents. We have confirmed 187 federal judges who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We are protecting pro-life students’ right to free speech on college campuses. And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your 1st Amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don’t, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay.  Sadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights. Shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice and we will win because we know how to win. We all know how to win. We all know how to win. You’ve been winning for a long time. You’ve been winning for a long time. Together we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to abortion, Democrats … And you know this. You’ve seen what’s happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you could even say for centuries.  Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth. Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb right up until delivery. Then we had the case of the Democrat Governor in the state of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we love the Commonwealth of Virginia. But what is going on in Virginia? What is going on? The Governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth. You remember that. Senate Democrats even blocked legislation that would give medical care to babies who survive attempted abortions.  And that’s why I’ve called on Congress, two of our great senators here, so many of our Congressman here. I called upon them to defend the dignity of life and to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in their mother’s womb. This year, the March for Life is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which forever enshrined women’s rights to vote in the United States and given by the United States Constitution. Such a big event. Today, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the right and all of their rights as given in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life.  To all the women here today, your devotion and your leadership uplifts our entire nation and we thank you for that. The tens of thousands of Americans gathered today not only stand for life, it’s really here that they stand for it so proudly together and I want to thank everybody for that. You stand for life each and every day. You provide housing, education, jobs, and medical care to the women that you serve. You find loving families for children in need of a forever home. You host baby showers for expecting moms. You just make it your life’s mission to help spread God’s grace. And to all of the moms here today, we celebrate you and we declare that mothers are heroes. That’s true. Your strength, devotion, and drive is what powers our nation. And because of you, our country has been blessed with amazing souls who have changed the course of human history.  We cannot know what our citizens yet unborn will achieve, the dreams they will imagine, the masterpieces they will create, the discoveries they will make. But we know this, every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting. And above all, we know that every human soul is divine and every human life, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of Almighty God. Together we will defend this truth all across our magnificent land. We will set free the dreams of our people and with determined hope, we look forward to all of the blessings that will come from the beauty, talent, purpose, nobility, and grace of every American child. I want to thank you. This is a very special moment. It’s so great to represent you. I love you all. And I say with true passion, thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you."
"Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today Israel takes a big step towards peace. Young people across the Middle East are ready for a more hopeful future and governments through out the region are realizing that terrorism and Islamic extremism are everyone’s common enemy. Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with both the prime minister of Israel and a man that’s working very hard to become the prime minister of Israel in the longest running election of all time, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, and both leaders joined me to express their support for this effort, proving that the state of Israel is looking for peace and that peace transcends politics by any measure. Unmeasurable. That’s what they want. On my first trip overseas as president, I visited the Holy Land of Israel. I was deeply moved an amazed by what this small country had achieved in the face of overwhelming odds and never-ending threats. The state of Israel comprises only a minuscule amount of land in the Middle East, and yet it has become a thriving center of democracy and of ancient culture and commerce. Israel is a light unto the world, the hearts and history of our people are woven together. The land of Israel is an ancient home, a sacred place of worship, and a solemn promise to the Jewish people that we will never again repeat history’s darkest hour.  During my trip to Israel, I also met with Palestinian President Abbas in Bethlehem. I was saddened by the fate of the Palestinian people. They deserve a far better life, they deserve the chance to achieve their extraordinary potential. Palestinians have been trapped in a cycle of terrorism, poverty, and violence exploited by those seeking to use them as pawns to advance terrorism and extremism.  I returned from my visit determined to find a constructive path and it’s got to be a very powerful path forward in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To further this effort, I also met with President Abbas at the White House. Forging peace between Israelis and Palestinians may be the most difficult challenge of all. All prior administrations from President Lyndon Johnson have tried and bitterly failed, but I was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems.  It’s been a long and very arduous process to arrive at this moment. On Sunday I delivered to Prime Minister Netanyahu my vision for peace, prosperity, and a brighter future for Israelis and Palestinians. This vision for peace is fundamentally different from past proposals. In the past, even the most well-intentioned plans were light on factual details and heavy on conceptual frameworks. By contrast, our plan is 80 pages and is the most detailed proposal ever put forward by far. As I have seen throughout my long career as a deal-maker, complex problems require nuanced, fact-based remedies. That is why our proposal provides precise technical solutions to make Israelis, Palestinians, and the region safer and much more prosperous. My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel’s security.  Today Israel has taken a giant step toward peace. Yesterday Prime Minister Netanyahu informed me that he is willing to endorse the vision as the basis for direct negotiations, and I will say, the general also endorsed, and very strongly, with the Palestinians a historic breakthrough. And likewise, we have really a situation having to do with a race that is taking place right now. It will end and we have the support, and it’s very important to say this, of both parties and almost all people in Israel. They want peace and they want peace badly.  This is the first time Israel has authorized the release of a conceptual map illustrating the territorial compromises it’s willing to make for the cause of peace and they’ve gone a long way. This is an unprecedented and highly significant development. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for having the courage to take this bold step forward. We have a lot of powerful people in this room, a lot of the people that can help make it work. So that’s quite a thunderous  . Thank you very much. Thank you. We will form a joint committee with Israel to convert the conceptual map into a more detailed and calibrated rendering so that recognition can be immediately achieved. We will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future Palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism.  Under this vision, Jerusalem will remain Israel’s undivided, very important, undivided capital. But that’s no big deal because I’ve already done that for you. We’ve already done that, but that’s okay. It’s going to remain that way and the United States will recognize Israeli sovereignty over the territory that my vision provides to be part of the state of Israel, very important. And crucially, the proposed transition to a two-state solution will present no incremental security risk to the state of Israel whatsoever. We will not allow a return to the days of bloodshed, bus bombings, nightclub attacks, and relentless terror. Won’t be allowed. Peace requires compromise, but we will never ask Israel to compromise its security. Can’t do that.  As everyone knows, I have done a lot for Israel, moving the United States embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the Golan Heights, and frankly, perhaps most importantly, getting out of the terrible Iran nuclear deal. There is a lot of spirit in this room. It’s true. You don’t see it often. You don’t see it often. Therefore, it is only reasonable that I have to do a lot for the Palestinians or it just wouldn’t be fair. Don’t clap for that but it’s true. It wouldn’t be fair. I want this deal to be a great deal for the Palestinians. It has to be.  Today’s agreement is a historic opportunity for the Palestinians to finally achieve an independent state of their very own. After 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they will ever have, and last for a lot of reasons. We’ll never have a team like we have right now. We have a team of people that love the United States, and they love Israel, and they’re very smart, and very, very committed, from your ambassador, David Friedman to Jason and Avi and Jared, and they are all great deal makers and they also understand the other side and they want the other side to do well, because that’s the sign of a great deal and they understand that.  And I just appreciate all the hard work you’ve put in and so many of your other friends. And, of course, our great Secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Oh, that’s impressive. That was very impressive, Mike. That reporter couldn’t have done too good a job on you yesterday. I think you did a good job on her actually. That’s good. Thank you, Mike. Great, are you running for Senate? I guess the answer is no after that. They all want him to. Kansas, great state. They want him to, but you’re doing a great job. Don’t move.  The Palestinian people have grown distrustful after years of unfulfilled promises, so true, yet I know they are ready to escape their tragic past and realize a great destiny. But we must break free of yesterday’s failed approaches. This map will more than double the Palestinian territory and provide a Palestinian capital in eastern Jerusalem where America will proudly open an embassy. No Palestinians or Israelis will be uprooted from their homes. Israel will work closely with a wonderful person, a wonderful man, the King of Jordan, to ensure that the status quo of the Temple Mount is preserved and strong measures are taken to ensure that all Muslims who wish to visit peacefully and pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque will be able to do so. This is a major statement. This is of major importance.  And at the same time, our vision will deliver a massive commercial investment of $50 billion into the new Palestinian state. You have many, many countries that want to partake in this, and many of them are surrounding. They all want this to happen. Virtually every one of them want this to happen. And I think, Bibi, you know that very well. You’re going to have tremendous support from your neighbors and beyond your neighbors.  Over the next 10 years, if executed well, 1 million great new Palestinian jobs will be created. Their poverty rate will be cut in half. And their poverty rate is unacceptable now and only getting worse. Their GDP will double and triple and much-needed hope, joy, opportunity, and prosperity will finally arrive for the Palestinian people. Our vision will end the cycle of Palestinian dependency upon charity and foreign aid. They will be doing phenomenally all by themselves. They are a very, very capable people. And we will help by empowering the Palestinians to thrive on their own. Palestinians will be able to seize the new future with dignity, self-sufficiency, and national pride.  To ensure a successful Palestinian state, we are asking the Palestinians to meet the challenges of peaceful co-existence. This includes adopting basic laws enshrining human rights, protecting against financial…  Laws, enshrining human rights. Protecting against financial and political corruption, stopping the malign activities of Hamas, Islamic jihad and other enemies of peace. Ending the incitement of hatred against Israel, so important, and permanently halting the financial compensation to terrorists.  And perhaps most importantly, my vision gives the Palestinians the time needed to rise up and meet the challenges of statehood. I sent a letter today to President Abbas. I explained to him that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years.  During this time, Palestinians can use all appropriate deliberation to study the deal, negotiate with Israel, achieve the criteria for statehood, and become a truly independent and wonderful state. President Abbas, I want you to know that if you choose the path to peace, America and many other countries we will be there. We will be there to help you in so many different ways and we will be there every step of the way. We will be there to help.  In other words, for the first time in many, many decades, I can say it will work. It’s going to work. If they do this, it will work. Your response to this historic opportunity will show the world to what extent you are ready to lead the Palestinian people to statehood. The Middle East is changing rapidly. On my first trip aboard as President, I traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss our shared priorities with the 54 leaders of the Muslim and Arab countries.  I made clear that all civilized nations share the same goals, stamping out extremism, creating opportunity for the region’s youth, and we have to take care of the region’s youth. The region’s youth is growing up with no hope. We have to take care of the regions youth and existing in harmony with one’s neighbors. Since that time, immense progress has been made. A growing number of nations have taken strong stands against terrorism and radicalization. You see it. Thanks to the courage of US forces the ISIS territorial caliphate, 100%; not 95% not 99, or any other percent, 100% of their caliphate, ISIS is destroyed. And its Savage leader Al-Baghdadi is now dead.  And I want to thank, we have some our great senators and congressmen and women here and I want to thank you all for the tremendous help. Thank you very much. Jim. Ted, everybody. Stew. Our leader, thank you. Mark, thank you. Great people. These are great people. They work so hard and they love this country.  The Iranian regime is isolated and weakened greatly. We eliminated Qasem Soleimani the worlds top terrorist. And as you know, he was with the head of Hezbollah. I don’t think they were up to anything good. I don’t think so. He ran an organization called Jerusalem Liberation Forces and used his hatred, total severe hatred of Israel as a rallying cry to divert attention from the incompetence and shortcomings of his government.  He falsely promoted the sinister notion that a free Jerusalem, we must really be at war with Israel. So to have it free, we have to be at war with Israel and he said it very, very powerfully. In fact, it’s been in this false war that Israel really the enemies of peace have used it. They just used it as an excuse to divide and totally oppress the Middle East. In truth, Jerusalem is liberated.  Jerusalem is a safe, open, democratic city that welcomes people of all faiths and all places. It is time for the Muslim world to fix the mistake it made in 1948 when it chose to attack instead of recognize the new state of Israel. It’s time. Since then, the amount of needless bloodshed and all squandered opportunities, so many squandered opportunities in the name of senseless causes is beyond measure. The Palestinians have been the primary pawn in this regional adventurism and it’s time for this sad chapter in history to end, end quickly, end now. It’s never too late for courageous leaders to set a new course to pursue what is right, to change the future, only for the better.  America is prepared to work with all parties on our vision. So many other countries are willing, ready, and able to work with us. I’ve spoken to many of them. I cannot believe the amount of support this morning has. I cannot believe it. I have been called by leaders. Boris called so many called and they’re all saying whatever we can do to help, they all want to see it happen.  But America cannot care more about peace than the stakeholders in the region. There are many Muslims who never visited Al-Aqsa and many Christians and Jews who never visited the Holy sites in the West bank described so vividly in the Bible. My vision will change that. Our majestic biblical heritage will be able to live, breathe, and flourish in modern times. All humanity should be able to enjoy the glories of the Holy land. This part of the world is forever connected to the human soul and the human spirit. These ancient lands should not be symbols of conflict, but eternal symbols of peace.  Thank you again for all of the work you’ve all done and all of these incredible honored guests for being here and in particular, I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu. I also want to thank Oman Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates for the incredible work they’ve done helping us with so much and sending their ambassadors to be with us today. Thank you very much for being here. Yes . Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please give our regards. America’s partnerships in the region have never been greater, and our alliance with the state of Israel has never ever been stronger than it is today.  Together we can bring about a new dawn in the Middle East. And I would now, again, just like to thank everybody and a very special group of people, an incredible group of people. So many have been with us on this journey right from the beginning and we’re getting there. They say it’s the toughest deal ever to make in business when I have a tough deal, people would say this is tougher than the Israelis and the Palestinians. They used it as an excuse, meaning that was always the standard. Actually, there’s nothing tougher than this one, but we have to get it done. We have an obligation to humanity to get it done.  So I would now like to introduce the prime minister of Israel who’s worked so hard on this. Benjamin Netanyahu, thank you."
"Well, thank you very much. I am working very hard for you, I will tell you. And sometimes you don’t make it easy, and I certainly don’t make it easy on you. I will continue that tradition if I might this morning. And Arthur, I don’t know if I agree with you. But I don’t if Arthur’s going to like what I’m going to say. But I loved listening to you, it was really great. Thank you very much. And thank you, Congressman, for the great job you’ve been doing and the relationship and the help. You’re a warrior. Thank you very much. And Kevin, you’re a warrior, thank you. The job you’ve done is incredible. It wasn’t supposed to be that way. A lot of extra work, unnecessary work.  It’s wonderful to be with the thousands of religious believers for the 68th Annual National Prayer Breakfast. I have been here from the first one, where I had the privilege of being asked. I’ve been with you for a long time before that. We’ve made tremendous progress, tremendous progress. You know what we’ve done. I don’t think anybody’s done more than all of us together during these last three years, and it’s been my honor.  But this morning we come together as one nation, blessed to live in freedom and grateful to worship in peace. As everybody knows, my family, our great country and your President, have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people. They have done everything possible to destroy us. And by so doing, very badly hurt our nation. They know what they are doing is wrong, but they put themselves far ahead of our great country.  Weeks ago and again, yesterday, courageous Republican politicians and leaders had the wisdom, fortitude and strength to do what everyone knows was right. I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say I pray for you, when they know that that’s not so.  So many people have been hurt, and we can’t let that go on. I’ll be discussing that a little bit later at the White House. We’re joined today by two people whose faith inspires us all. Our amazing, wonderful friend, Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife, Karen. Thank you to all of our great political leaders out there. So many that I’ve been working with so hard over the last three years, and we’ve accomplished so much. And to members of my Cabinet in attendance, Secretary Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, David Bernhardt, Gene Scalia, Alex Azar, Ben Carson, Dan Brouillette, Betsy DeVos, Robert Wilkie, and Administrator, Jovita Carranza.  Joining us for this cherished tradition are a lot of friends in the audience. Many really have become friends. They are political leaders. They’ve become great friends. That’s all I get to meet anymore. That and the enemies and the allies, and we have them all. We have allies, we have enemies. Sometimes the allies are enemies, but we just don’t know it. But we’re changing all that. But thank you all, and thank you all for being here. I also want to welcome foreign dignitaries from more than 140 countries, that’s something. That’s something.  Everyone here today is united by your shared conviction. We know that our nation is stronger, our future is brighter, and our joy is greater when we turn to God and ask him to shed his grace on our lives. On Tuesday, I addressed Congress on the State of the Union and the great American comeback. That’s what it is.  Our country has never done better than it is doing right now. Our economy is the strongest it has ever been. For those of you that are interested in stocks, it looks like the stock market will be way up again today. According to the latest Gallup poll that just came out a little while ago, a few minutes ago, American satisfaction is at the highest level ever recorded. Can you imagine? And that’s from Gallup, no friend of mine. 90% of Americans say they are satisfied with their personal lives. How about that, isn’t that something? It just came out today. They must have known I was going to be here.  In everything we do, we are creating a culture that protects freedom and that includes religious freedom. As I said on Tuesday in the House chamber, in America, we don’t punish prayer. We don’t tear down crosses. We don’t band symbols of faith. We don’t muzzle preachers. We don’t muzzle pastors. In America, we celebrate faith. We cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the glory of God.  So much of the greatness we have achieved, the mysteries we’ve unlocked and the wonders we’ve built, the challenges we’ve met, and the incredible heights that we’ve reached has come from the faith of our families and the prayers of our people. Before America declared independence, patriots in all 13 colonies came together in days of fasting and prayer. In the bitter cold of Valley Forge, Washington and his men had no food, no supplies, and very little chance of victory. Reminded me a little bit of 2016, we had very little chance of victory, except for the people in this room and some others believed we were going to win. I believed we were going to win. But what they did was have an unwavering belief that God was with them. I believed that too.  God is with the people in this room. Before a single skyscraper rose up in New York City, thousands of poor American families donated all they could to build the magnificent St. Patrick’s Cathedral. When Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon, he said, “Houston, I would like to request a few moments of silence.” Then he read from the Bible. At every stage, our nation’s long march for civil rights was inspired, sustained and uplifted by faith, prayer and devotion of religious believers. To protect faith communities, I have taken historic action to defend religious liberty, including the constitutional right to pray in public schools.  We can also talk about the Johnson Amendment. We can talk about Mexico City policy. We’ve done a lot. But I also recently took executive action to stop taxpayer dollars from going to colleges and universities that spread the poison of antisemitism and bad things about Christianity. We are upholding the sanctity of life, sanctity of life. And we are doing that like nobody has ever done it before from this position. You better get out and vote on November 3rd, because you have a lot of people out there that aren’t liking what we’re doing. And we’re pursuing medical breakthroughs to save premature babies, because every child is a sacred gift from God.  Together, we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society. We are lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We are bringing hope to forgotten communities, and more Americans are working today. 160 million, a little bit short, just a little bit. 160 million, we’ve never been even close than ever before. Think of it. More Americans are working today, almost 160 million than ever before. Our unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country. A more specific number and numbers that you hear me say, if you listen. African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American… The best unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Women, best in 71 years. Sorry, we’ll have you there soon. Soon it will be assured. I have to apologize to the women, it’s only 71 years. But the best unemployment numbers, we have.  We’re doing things that nobody thought possible. We’re setting records that nobody thought achievable. And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, which so many people in this room have worked on for so long. We passed criminal justice reform into law, and I signed it nine months ago. And it’s proving more and more that America is indeed a nation that believes in redemption. What’s happened with prisoners is a miracle. Prisoners would come out, nobody would give them a job. And oftentimes, most of the time, almost all of the time, they’d go back into prison. They’d get caught doing something bad. They had no money, they had no hope, they had no job. Now they’re coming out into a booming economy, and employers are hiring them. And to a certain extent, maybe because they’re having a hard time getting people. The first time in our country’s history actually, we’re running out of people.  We have plants moving in by the thousands. We have car companies coming from Japan and from Germany, from lots of other places, and we need people. Employers are hiring prisoners and they would have never done it except for what we’ve done with criminal justice reform, but even before that because the economy has become so powerful. These prisoners have done an incredible job. The employers are saying, “Why didn’t I do this 20 years ago?” So it’s an incredible thing what’s happening to people that are given a second chance and sometimes a third chance, in all fairness. It’s something that everybody in this room should be very proud about, because you’ve always felt that way long before it was fashionable. So I want to thank you for that.  As we revive our economy, we are also renewing our national spirit. Today, we proudly proclaim that faith is alive and well and thriving in America, and we’re going to keep it that way. Nobody will have it changed. It won’t happen. As long as I’m here, it will never ever happen. Something which wasn’t done nearly enough, I could almost say wasn’t done at all. We are standing up for persecuted Christians and religious minorities all around the world like nobody has ever done.  Last year at the United Nations, I was honored to be the first President to host a meeting of religious freedom. It was based all on religious freedom. That was the first meeting of its kind ever held at the United Nations. There, I called upon all nations to combat the terrible injustice of religious persecution, and people listened. Countries that we give billions of dollars to, they listened because they had to listen. It’s amazing how that works, isn’t it? And nobody ever played that game before. Weeks ago, a 21-year-old woman who goes by the name of Mary, was seized and imprisoned in Iran because she converted to Christianity and shared the gospel with others. In Venezuela, the dictator, Maduro, has arrested church leaders. At the State of the Union, I was honored to host the true and legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Good man. I told him that all Americans stand with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.  Yesterday, our administration launched the International Religious Freedom Alliance, the first ever alliance devoted to promoting religious liberty. It was something, really something. More than 25 countries have already joined our campaign. I want to thank Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, along with Ambassador Sam Brownback, who are both here this morning, for leading this historic initiative. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Thank you. All of us here today reaffirm these timeless truths. Faith keeps us free. Prayer makes us strong, and God alone is the author of life and the giver of grace.  With us this morning is a pastor who embodies the miracle of faith and the power of prayer, Reverend Gerald Toussaint, from Louisiana. Reverend Toussaint is an army veteran, a truck driver, and a pastor. He leads the same church that his father led, Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, which has been a pillar of the community for more than 140 years. Last year, Mount Pleasant was one of three African-American churches in Louisiana that was destroyed in fires set by a wicked, hate-filled arsonist. Yet in the wake of such shocking evil, America witnessed the unshakable unity, devotion, and spirit of Reverend Toussaint and his entire highly spirited, beautiful congregation. Families quickly came together in prayer. Soon, people from all across Louisiana came to help any way they could. Americans in all 50 states and 20 different countries heard about it, and they donated more than $2 million to help rebuild Mount Pleasant and the other two churches that were burnt. Where is he?  On Easter Sunday, just days after he lost his church, Reverend Toussaint preached about what it all meant. What does it mean? The Easter season he said, is a fitting metaphor for recent events. It was dark the day that Jesus was crucified, it was dark at night when they burned our church. What has happened since is like a resurrection. Old things are gone, but it’s going to be a brand new start and it’s going to be better than everybody, Reverend. Better than ever, fantastic. Today, just 10 months later, the ground is cleared. Careful plans have been made, and they’re beautiful plans. Construction is about to begin on the new and very, very magnificent Mount Pleasant Church. Congratulations.  You know, the Reverend says that, “We’re rebuilding because that’s what Jesus does. He rebuilds.” He lives and he breathes, that’s what he does. He wants it to be rebuilt. It was torn apart, but it’s being rebuilt again, and I’ll bet you it will indeed be bigger, better and nicer than before. What do you think, Reverend, yes? It’s going to have your mark on it. It did have, and now it have… even great. And your father is looking down on you right now and he’s very, very proud of the job you have done. Thank you very much. Very much inspire us, Reverend. Thank you.  Well, I want to just thank everybody. This has been very special. Tell your congregation and all of your people that we have 350 million people in our country. They’re proud Americans and they respect what we’re doing, even those that you don’t think so much like us, respect us, want to be with us. They’re respecting our fight, and we are in a fight. Religion in this country and religion all over the world, certain religions in particular, are under siege. We won’t let that happen. We are going to protect our religions. We are going to protect Christianity. We are going to protect our great ministers and pastors and rabbis, and all of the people that we so cherish and that we so respect.  America is eternally in the debt of our nation’s African-American churches all throughout this country. That’s why it’s so fitting and so… It’s one of the reasons we chose this particular church in Louisiana. For generations, they’ve bravely fought for justice and lifted up the conscience of our nation, and we are grateful beyond any measure. But I can say that going beyond that, we’re grateful to the people in this room for the love they show to religion. Not one religion, but many religions. They are brave, they are brilliant, they are fighters. They like people, and sometimes they hate people. I am sorry, I apologize. I am trying to learn. It’s not easy. It’s not easy.  When they impeach you for nothing, then you’re supposed to like them. It’s not easy, folks. I do my best. But I’ll tell you what we are doing. We’re restoring hope and spreading faith. We’re helping citizens of every background take part in the great rebuilding of our nation. We’re declaring that America will always shine as a land of liberty and light unto all nations of the world. We want every nation to look up to us like they are right now. We were not a respected nation just a few years ago, we had lost our way. Our country is respected again by everybody.  This morning, let us ask Father in Heaven to guide our steps, protect our children, and bless our families. And with all of our heart, let us forever embrace the eternal truth that every child is made equal by the hand of almighty God. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you."
"Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well thank you very much, everybody. Wow. We’ve all been through a lot together, and we probably deserve that hand for all of us because it’s been a very unfair situation. I invited some of our very good friends, and we have limited room, but everybody wanted to come. We kept it down to a minimum. And believe it or not, this is a minimum. But a tremendous thing was done over the last number of months. But really if you go back to it over the last number of years, we had the witch hunt. It started from the day we came down the elevator, myself and our future first lady who’s with us right now. Thank you Melania.  And it never really stopped. We’d been going through this now for over three years. It was evil. It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars. And this should never ever happen to another president, ever. I don’t know that other presidents would have been able to take it. Some people said no, they wouldn’t have, but I can tell you at a minimum you have to focus on this because it can get away very quickly. No matter who you have with you, it can get away very quickly. It was a disgrace. Had I not fired James Comey, who was a disaster by the way, it’s possible I wouldn’t even be standing here right now. We caught him in the act. Dirty cops, bad people.  If this happened to president Obama, a lot of people would have been in jail for a long time already, many, many years. I want to start by thanking some of, and I call them friends because you develop friendships and relationships when you’re in battle and war much more so than, gee, let’s have a normal situation. With all that we’ve gone through, we’ve done I think more than any president and administration. And really I say for the most part, Republican congressmen, congresswomen and Republican senators, we’ve done more than any administration in the first few years. You look at all of the things we’ve done.  … administration in the first few years. You look at all of the things we’ve done. I watched this morning as they tried to take credit for the stock market from… Think of that. Let me tell you, if we didn’t win, the stock market would have crashed, and the market was going up a lot before the election because it was looking like we had a good chance to win, and then went up tremendously from the time we won the election until the time we took office, which was November 8th of January 20th. That’s our credit. That’s all our credit, and leading up to that point was our credit because there was hope, and one of the reasons the stock market’s gone up so much in the last few days is people think we’re doing so well. They liked the State of the Union speech.  It really is. It’s a true honor to give it, and making the State of the Union speech, I was with some people that have been around. They’d been all over the world, and one of them said… highly sophisticated person said, “No matter where you go in the world, doesn’t make any difference. There is nothing like what I witnessed tonight, the beauty, the majesty of the chamber, the power of the United States, the power of the people in this room, really, an amazing… ” I don’t think there is anything like that anywhere in the world. You can go to any other country, you can go to any other location, any other place, it’s the beauty of everything. It’s what it represents and how it represents our country.  I want to start by introducing some of the people that are here. I know some are going to be left out, but they work so hard, and this is really not a news conference. It’s not a speech. It’s not anything. It’s just we’re sort of… It’s a celebration because we have something that just worked out. I mean, it worked out. We went through hell unfairly, did nothing wrong, did nothing wrong. I’ve done things wrong in my life, I will admit. Not purposely, but I’ve done things wrong. But this is what the end result is.  . You can take that home, honey. Maybe we’ll frame it. It’s the only good headline I’ve ever had in the Washington Post, I tell you, but every paper is the same. Does anybody have those papers? Does anybody have them because they’re really like that, so I appreciate that.  But some of the people here have been incredible warriors. They’re warriors, and there’s nothing from a legal standpoint. This is a political thing, and every time I’d say, “This is unfair, let’s go to court,” they say, “Sir, you can’t go to court. This is politics.” We were treated unbelievably unfairly. You have to understand, we first went through Russia, Russia, Russia. It was all bullshit. We then went through The Mueller Report, and they should have come back one day later. They didn’t. They came back two years later after lives were ruined, after people went bankrupt, after people lost all their money. People came to Washington to help other people, bright-eyed and bushy-tail, they say, they came one or two or three people in particular, but many people.  We had a rough campaign. It was nasty. It was one of the nastiest, they say. They say Andrew Jackson was always the nastiest campaign. They actually said we topped it. It was a nasty both in the primaries and in the election, but you see, we thought after the election would stop, but it didn’t stop. It just started, and tremendous corruption. Tremendous corruption. We had a campaign. Little did we know, we were running against some very, very bad and evil people with fake dossiers, with all of these horrible dirty cops that took these dossiers and did bad things. They knew all about it.  The FISA courts should be ashamed of themselves. It’s a very tough thing. Then we ended up winning on Russia, Russia, Russia. It should have taken the one day, as I said, and it took years. Then Bob Mueller testified. That didn’t work out so well for the other side, but they should have said that first week because it came out. Is that right, Jim Jordan? They knew in the first two days, actually, Devin, is that right, two days they knew that we were totally innocent, but they kept it going. Mark. They kept it going forever because they wanted to inflict political pain on somebody that had just won an election that to a lot of people were surprised.  I mean, we had polls that said we were going to win. We had Los Angeles Times, and a few papers actually said it was… we’re going to win, but it was going to be close. We did win. It was one of the greatest wins of all time. They said, “Okay, he won.” I wrote this down because that was where a thing called the insurance policy to me, when I saw the insurance policy… and that was done long before the election. That was done when they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.  By the way, Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for, millions, millions of dollars, the fake dossier, and now, Christopher Steele admits it’s a fake because he got sued by rich people. I should have sued him too, but when you’re president, people don’t like suing. I want to thank my legal team by the way, not for that advice, but for other advice. Pat, Jay. Pat. You guys, stand up, please. Great job.  Right at the beginning, they said, “Sir, you have nothing to worry about. All of the facts are on your side.” I said, “You don’t understand. That doesn’t matter. That doesn’t matter,” and that was really true. They made up facts. A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air, just made it up. They say he’s a screenwriter, a failed screenwriter. He tried to go… unfortunately, he went into politics after that.  Remember he said the statement, which is a mob statement, “Don’t call me. I’ll call you.” I didn’t say that. Fortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. We had transcribers, professional transcribers. Then they said, “Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct,” but Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, we had some people that really amazing, but we did everything. We said, “What’s wrong with it?” “Well, they didn’t add this word or that… ” it didn’t matter.  I said, “Add it. They’re probably wrong, but add it.” Now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. When you read those transcripts, Tim Scott, I don’t know if Tim’s here, but he said, “Sir,” he was the first one to call me, “Sir. I read the transcript. You did nothing wrong,” and Mitch, he stayed there right from the beginning. He never changed. Mitch McConnell, I want to tell you, you did a fantastic job. Somebody said, “Mitch is quiet,” and I said, “He’s not quiet. He’s not quiet, but he doesn’t want people to know him.” They said, “Is Mitch smart?” I said, “Well, let’s put it this way. For many, many years, a lot of very smart, bad in many cases, sometimes good, but people have been trying to take his place, and to the best of my knowledge, I’ve never even heard the subject come up because they’d been wiped out so fast.”  This guy is great, and I appreciate it. Mitch, and he’s also given us 191 now, 191 federal judges, two Supreme Court judges. We’re up to 191. Great guy. Great guy. He’s a tough guy to read. I’m good at reading people. Tough guy to read I’d call him. My wife would say, “How’d you do with Mitch?” “I don’t know.” That’s what makes him good, when you can read somebody. Fantastic job.  He understood this was crooked politics. This was crooked politics. How about all these people? They’re running for office. They’re saying the worst things about me, like eight senators on the Democrat side, most of them go wiped out. They got their 1% or less. Most of them got less. They decided to I had to go home. “Let’s go back to California. Let’s go back to,” wherever they came from. “Let’s go back to New York,” how about that one. Our New York Senator Gillibrand, “Let’s go back to New York,” after they get nothing, and then they take an oath that they will be fair, that they will be… all of the different things. Then they had to sign. They’re not fair.  But here’s the beauty: so we have four left. They’re saying the most horrendous things about me. It’s okay, it’s politics. Then they’re supposed to vote on me. They’re trying to replace me, and then they’re supposed to be voting. I think it’s, I mean, I think it’s incredible, but so Mitch, I want to thank you very much. Incredible. You have some of your folks here. They’re incredible people, and they’ve been right from the beginning. Again, you’re out of session, unfortunately I didn’t… I only told these folks, “Let’s do this today.”  We did a prayer breakfast this morning, and I thought that was really good. In fact, that was so good, it might wipe this out, but by the end, by the time we finish this, we’ll wipe that one out, those statements. I had Nancy Polosi sitting four seats away, and I’m saying things that a lot of people wouldn’t have said, but I meant every word of it. But we have some of the folks that are going to be leaving right after this, and they work hard and they did work hard, Bill Cassidy, senator, stand up, Bill. What a guy.  Great man. When I need to know about health insurance and preexisting conditions and individual mandates, I call Bill or I called Barrasso. We got those two guys. They know more than anybody. A man who just became a Senate, he’s a little bit like me. We have a couple of them, very successful guy in business and he said, “What the hell? I’ll run for the Senate from Indiana,” and he ran, and I saw him on television destroying his opponent in a debate. I said, “This guy could win,” and I got behind him, and Mike Braun, you have done some great job. Thank you very much. Tough. Tough. Thank you.  A man who got James Comey to choke, and he was just talking in his regular voice. He’s the roughest man. He’s actually a unbelievable, and I appreciate the letter you sent me today. I just got it. But he’s got this voice that scares people. People from Iowa can be very tough. We’re doing very well in Iowa, but I’ll tell you, Chuck Grassley, he’s looking to call me, “Well, you tell me, what did you say?” Now, he wasn’t being rough. That was just the way he talked, and that was when Comey, I think that was when Comey announced that he was leaking, lying and everything else. He’d choked because he never heard anybody talk like that. You should have gotten? I wish you got angry. You could have gotten the whole ballgame. He would have said, “I give up.” Chuck Grassley is an incredible guy.  And a man who, he was running against a tough smart campaigner. We learned that how good she was. She was a great campaigner. In fact, by the end of the campaign, she was actually, I thought she was more for me than you were Josh. I was worried. I saw red. She was saying the greatest things about me. You know who I’m talking about. I went to a great place, Missouri, and I said, “Who do you have to beat her?” They said, “Well, we have four people.” I said, “Let me see them. I got an interview… ” Can you imagine, I’m interviewing people for the United States Senate. This is what I do. Where have I gone? But I love it. I love it because we’re getting great people.  The first one I met was Josh Hawley. After about 10 minutes, I said to the people, “Don’t show me anybody else. This is the guy.” He was the Attorney General, did a phenomenal job in the state, highly respected, and Claire McCaskill. The theory was you couldn’t beat her. Great campaigner. Remember the last campaign, she was going to be taken out. She was always going to be taken out, and she wins, and people say, “How did that happen?” Didn’t happen with him, but she got so friendly toward me. In fact, one of the ads I still have, I’m putting it in the archives as one of the best ads I’ve ever read. She tried to convince people that we were best friends, but Josh ended up winning by five or six points.  You were unbelievable. You were tough, and you are something. One of the greatest supporters on the impeachment hoax was Josh Hawley. He was incensed actually. I watched him. He was incensed at what they were doing and what they were saying. Those were the ones… I had some that said, “I wish you didn’t make the call,” and that’s okay. If they need that, it’s incorrect. It’s totally incorrect.  Then you have some that used religion as a crutch. They never used it before. An article written today, never heard him use it before, but today, it’s one of those things, but it’s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for president. But Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. Josh. Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future.  A man who is brilliant and who actually was deceived to an extent, comes from a great state, Utah, where my poll numbers have gone through the roof, and one of the senators poll numbers, and not this one, went down big. You saw that. You saw that, Mike? But Mike Lee is a brilliant guy. He’s difficult. Whenever I sign bills… We do sign a lot of legislation that’s, it’s big, and it’s powerful, but it’s sort of everybody has to approve it. I see 99 to 1. 99 to 1. I say, “Don’t tell me who’s the one. Is it Mike?” “Yes.”  He always has a good reason for it too, by the way. But he is. He’s incredible. Right at the beginning, he knew we were right, Mike. I appreciate it very much. He just fantastic, and say hello to the people of Utah, and tell them I’m sorry about Mitt Romney. I’m sorry. We can say that Mike Lee is by far the most popular senator from the state, but you’ve done a fantastic job, Mike, in many ways, in many ways.  A young woman who I didn’t know at all, but she’s been so supportive, and I’ve had great support from other people in that state. She’s been so supportive, and she’s been downright nasty and mean about the unfairness to the president, and Kelly Loeffler, I appreciate very much. Thank you. . She saw it very early on.  We have… I don’t know if we have other senators here, but we’ve got a hell of a lot of congressmen. I’ll go over them quickly, but they have also been a… It helped when we won 197 to nothing. That’s got to be a first, Kevin, right? Is that a first? The Republicans have this image. See, I say Democrats are lousy politicians because they have lousy policy, open borders, sanctuary cities. They have horrible policy. Who the hell can win? Oh, their new policy’s raise taxes. They want to raise taxes.  All my life, I was into politics, but I’d say if you’re a politician, you want to say, “We’re going to lower taxes.” They want to raise taxes, so they have open borders, sanctuary cities, raise everybody’s taxes. Get rid of everybody’s health care, 180 million people in the United States, and they’re really happy, and we’re going to give you a healthcare that’s going to cost more money than the country could make in 30 years if it really does well. That’s one year.  I’ve always said they’re lousy politicians, but they do two things. They’re vicious and mean, vicious. These people are vicious. Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person, and she wanted to impeach a long time ago when she said, “I pray for the president. I pray for the… ” She doesn’t pray. She may pray, but she prays for the opposite, but I doubt she prays at all. These are vicious people, but they do two things: They stick together… Historically. I’m not talking now. They stick together like glue. That’s how they impeached because they had whatever the numbers, 220 people, so they don’t lose anybody. They’ll be able to impeach anybody.  You could be George Washington. You could have just won the war, and they say, “Let’s get them out of office,” and they stuck together, and they’re vicious as hell. They’ll probably come back for more, but maybe not because the Republican party’s poll numbers, Mitch, have now gone up more than any time I think since 2004, 2005, and you know what happened then, but in normal times, decades you would call it. That was a little unusual time. It was for a very short period. The Republicans party’s poll numbers and Donald Trump’s poll numbers are the highest I’ve ever had them, so maybe they won’t.  It’s no way to get your poll numbers up. It’s not worth it because from my family’s standpoint, it’s been very unfair for my family. It’s been very unfair to the country. Think of it, a phone call, a very good phone call. I know bad phone calls. This is a phone call where many people… I think Mike Pompeo was probably on the call. Where’s Mike? Mike Pompeo was on the call, and many people were on the call. I know that many people… They even have apprenti. Bringing up an old favorite word of mine, the apprentice, they have apprenti, they have people on these calls. I know there are many when I speak to the head of a nation, and they have many people on. I mean, all of a sudden, do you think they just… in the case of Ukraine, he’s a new president. Seems like a very nice person, by the way. His whole thing was corruption. He’s going to stop corruption.  We even have a treaty, 2001, 1999. It’s a treaty, signed treaty that we will work together to root out corruption in the Ukraine. I probably have a legal obligation, Mr. Attorney, to report corruption, but they don’t think it’s corrupt when a son that made no money, that got thrown out of the military, that had no money at all is working for $3 million up front, 83,000 a month, and that’s only Ukraine. Then goes to China, picks up $1.5 billion dollars. Then goes to Romania, I hear, and many other countries. They think that’s okay because if it is… Is Ivanka in the audience? Is Ivanka here? Boy, my kids could make a fortune. They could make a fortune. It’s corrupt, but it’s not even that. It’s just general corruption. The other thing that’s mentioned in the call and something that I’ve told Mike Pence, our great vice president… I would tell him all the time, and I told him when he went on the trip because he was over there. He never mentioned anything about this when you had your meeting. It’s a terrible thing, but I tell Mike. I said, “Mike, we’re giving them money, and you’re always talking about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix, but we’re giving them money. Tell me, why isn’t Germany paying money? Why isn’t France? Why isn’t United Kingdom paying money? Why aren’t they paying money? Why are we paying the money?”  Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, “Find out what the hell’s going on,” and I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said, asked a question, “How much is Germany paying? Why isn’t Germany paying? Why is the United States always the sucker?” Because we’re a bunch of suckers. But that’s turning around fast, but it makes it harder when stuff like this happens because you want to focus, and you want to focus perfectly.  Think what we could have done if the same energy was put into infrastructure, prescription drug prices. Think of what we could have done. I’m now talking both sides. Think of what we could have done if we had the same genius… because it’s genius. I will say it’s genius on the other side, maybe even more so because they took nothing and brought me to a final vote of impeachment. That’s a very ugly word to me. It’s a very dark word. Very ugly. They took nothing. They took a phone call that was a totally appropriate call… I call it a perfect call because it was… and they brought me to the final stages of impeachment, but now we have that gorgeous word. I never thought a word would sound so good. It’s called total acquittal. Total acquittal.  So I want to, if I could real fast, just introduce a few of the people. I have to start with Kevin. Man, did you do a job. Lucky you’re there. Lucky you’re there because it wouldn’t have worked out. If you don’t have the right people… I’ll tell you, Kevin McCarthy has done an incredible job.  stand up.  He loves his job, and he loves his country. Tell you what, Mitch and Kevin, they love what they do. Now, Mitch wouldn’t even tell you he liked it. “Say, Mitch, do you like it?” “I don’t know.” He’s the greatest poker player, right? Kevin was, “I love it,” and I will say that you’re going to be speaker of the house because of this impeachment hoax. I really believe it. I really believe it, and I’m going to work hard on it. I’m going to try and get out to those Trump areas that we won by a lot.  In ’18, we didn’t win. We just want two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won, but I went, and I made speeches. We had rallies, and we did a great job, and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year.  But we’re going to go, we’re going to do a job, and we’re going to win a lot of seats. We’re going to win a lot of seats. People are very angry that Nancy Pelosi and all of these guys… I mean, Nadler, I know him much of my life. He’s fought me in New York for 25 years. I always beat him, and I had to beat him another time, and I’ll probably have to beat him again because if they find that I happened to walk across the street and maybe go against the light or something, let’s impeach him, so I’ll probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone-cold crazy, but I’ve beaten them all my life, and I’ll beat them again if I have to. But what they’re doing is very unfair. Very unfair. Kevin McCarthy has been great.  A few names, right? There’ll be a few, you forget, if you want, you can raise, and I’ll say, “Great. Love to have you. Wonderful,” but we’re going to do the best we can. I have my Cabinet, but my Cabinet is different. I appoint them, okay? I didn’t see all of them helping so much. You know they were running their various bureaucracies. No, my Cabinet’s great, and they’re all here, but today is the day to celebrate these great warriors, these are great warriors. They really fought hard for us.  I’ll start Kelly Armstrong, North Dakota. Kelly. Thank you. Great job. Great job. Jim Banks of Indiana. Jim, thank you. Great job. Andy Biggs. Where’s Andy? Boy, oh, boy, Andy. He just… There’s a guy. He’s tough. I hear we’re doing well in Arizona. It’s going good, yeah? I think so. I think I saw a poll that was very good for me. I think we have to make sure Martha is going to do… I think Martha’s going to do good, but we have some states that are going to be not easy, but Arizona has been great, and we’re stopping illegal aliens from coming in. We’re putting up walls, New Mexico too, a state that’s never been in play for Republicans is totally in play. Nevada’s really looking good. We’re doing well. We’re doing well. We’re going to have a great…  There’s more spirit, I will say this, there’s more spirit now for the Republican party by far than the Democrats. Mike Pence just got back from a place, a beautiful place that Chuck Grassley knows well: Iowa. He was talking about these fiasco, the Democrats, they can’t count some simple votes, and yet they want to take over your healthcare system. Think of that. No, think of that.  But we also had an election out there, and we got 98% of the vote. We have two people running. I guess they consider them non-people but they are running. I mean, one was a governor, one was a congressman. They’re running. We’ve got 98% of the vote, and everybody from the media was saying, “Who are those crowds over there?” They expected it to be one of these competitive where everybody’s running because they want to win, they want to win. It was Trump, right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd, and a lot of, actually a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa, and a lot of-  Yeah, a lot of my guys went there. They went to Iowa and a lot of friends went there and we had tremendous… They say the spirit, the spirit for the Republican Party right now is stronger I think than it’s ever been in the history of our country. I think it’s stronger than it’s ever been.  And that includes Honest Abe Lincoln. A lot of people forget, Abe Lincoln, I wish he were here, I’d give him one hell of an introduction. But he was a Republican. Abe Lincoln, Honest Abe.  Bradley Byrne. Alabama. What a great place. Thank you Bradley. A man who has been an unbelievable friend of mine and spokesman and somebody that I really like. And I know Kelly, you’re going to end up liking him a lot. Something’s going to happen that’s going to be very good. I don’t know. I haven’t figured it out yet.  But Doug Collins, where is he? Where is Doug? You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug. Thank you very much. Thank you. Really amazing job.  A young man who is born with a great gene because I know his father and how great a politician he was, but he’s from Florida, sometimes controversial, but actually he’s not controversial. He’s solid as a rock and he’s a friend of mine. Matt Gates. Matt, thank you Matt. Great job.  All right, this guy, so he’s the NCAA, meaning a couple of years ago when he was in college, wrestling champion. NCAA, that’s the big deal. That means in all of college you’re the champ, you’re the best. His record was ridiculous. Nobody would, nobody could beat him. And I see it. Every time I see it, when I first got to know him, Jim Jordan, when I first got to know Jim, I’d say, “Huh, never wears a jacket. What the hell’s going on? He’s obviously very proud of his body.” And they say where he works out, you know where the Congressmen, Senators, they work at, they say when Jim works out, even though he’s not as young as he was, but when he works out, the machine starts burning… It’s just a different form of a workout than us. Right, Sunny?  There he is, look at that guy. But one day I’m looking and he looks tough and I’m looking at those years and I say, “Those ears have something going on there.” I said, “Did you ever wrestle?”  “Yeah, I did.” But he doesn’t talk. But I checked. This guy was a world… This guy was a champion, top, top wrestler. And when I had the top, I had all of the teams, and by the way, your Superbowl champions are coming, I think next week or soon. Very soon. And they, every one of them want to be here, and the coach loves us, the coach is great. Andy Reid. And every one of them want to be here. We have… People love it.  But we had all of the NCAA championship teams here. They had the golf, the basketball, they had every team here and one of the teams was wrestling. The wrestling team was, that Penn State? And Penn State won the title, have a great team. And I walked up with Jim and it’s like I didn’t exist. Those wrestlers, they grabbed him. They love Jim Jordan and we love you too because you are some warrior.  A woman who became a . We have a couple of women that became stars. You two. And I always liked the name of her, I like the name, Let’s Go. I liked it. That’s how I picked it. I liked the name. I saw that face. I saw that everything. They gave me cards. He had like seven opponents. Right? And you have no idea how much the public appreciates how smart, how sharp you are. This I can’t tell. I can’t tell. They just said, “You know, she’s really good. She’s really talented.” I said, “Let’s go.” We worked with her. She won her race. Tough race. It’s no longer tough because what she does out there is incredible. Arizona loves her. But you were so incredible representing, I don’t say me, representing our country and getting it out of this impeachment hoax. What you did was incredible. So Debbie, please stand up. Debbie Lesko.  A man who I became very friendly with. I don’t know why. You ever have where, I’ll ask the media, certain people call you take their calls, other people call, if they don’t have information, they won’t take anybody’s call. But other people call and you don’t. This is a guy, he just is just a very special guy. His wife, I actually like better than him to be honest, because he doesn’t know that I know that he didn’t actually support me right from the beginning, but she did.  And on my worst day, right? On my worst day, my worst, I won’t tell you why it was my worst, but it was not one of those good days. She got on a bus, got many other buses, and women all over North Carolina and they toured North Carolina. Well Mark was back sort of semi-supporting another candidate, which he ended up leaving very quickly. I don’t think you had a choice because of your wife, but thank her and Mark Meadows. He’s an extraordinary guy. I mean the only problem is I guess he’s announcing… He’d only win by 40 points, but he’s announcing that he’ll be not running this time. You have somebody good to run? Somebody going to win your district by at least 20 points, please? Okay.  But he’s a tremendously talented man, not just as a politician, as a human being he’s incredible. And during these horrible times, I mean the way he worked and Jim and all of you guys, the way they worked with so… It was like their life was at stake. So many. Ron DeSantis is another one. He works so hard. Then he called me, he said, “Sir, I’d like to run for governor.” I said, “Governor? I don’t want you to run. I like you staying.”  “No, I want to run for governor.”  And I said, “Well, if you have to.”  “I’d like your support.”  I said, “How can I support you? You’re at three. He was at three. He had no money. Somebody else was at 38 and they had 22 million cash. Right? I said, “Look, if it’s important, I’ll do it.” Because he’s been another great warrior and he’s, by the way, he ran, I endorsed him, his numbers went through the roof. The man who we beat who was expected to win easily called me after the race. He said, “You endorsed him and it was like a nuclear bomb went off. There was nothing I could do. He never even spent this money. He saved it.”  But Ron DeSantis is another one and now he’s the governor of Florida. And by the way, he’s a great governor. He’s a very popular governor. His numbers are in the 70s and he’s done a great job. But Mark, I want to thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Mark Meadows.  And Mike Johnson of Louisiana. Where’s Mike? Central casting, what a job. You can represent me anytime. You can represent me anytime. Thank you. What a job you’ve done. Thank you Mike.  And a man nobody’s ever heard of except the other side. He’s the other side’s worst nightmare. This guy goes down into dungeons and basements. He’ll find a document no matter what. He’s the most legitimate human being, he’s the hardest worker. He’s unbelievable. He took tremendous abuse. I mean abuse. The media and the other side and the bad ones. The leakers, the liars, the dirty cops. They wanted to destroy him. They tried, they got close, but he wouldn’t let it happen. And honestly, in a certain way, he was the first one. Wouldn’t you say Jim and Mark and every… This was the first guy. He came out of nowhere. He’s saying, “These people are corrupt.” He’s still saying it, and he was unbelievable. Devin Nunez. He was unbelievable.  That’s so true, Devin. He’d come in and say… I didn’t even know him. I just heard there were like, there was this Congressman who kept going into a basement into files. He knew something was wrong. You felt it, right? And now we know a lot more than we knew then. Right? You never thought it was as bad as it is and hopefully we’re going to take care of things because we can never ever allow this to happen again.  Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. Scott, thank you. Thank you Scott. Really great. And you’re doing very well over there by the way. Just saw your numbers. A man who is a… I mean central casting. If I’m going to pick Perry Mason, I’m going to do a remake of Perry Mason, other than Bill Barr I’d pick this guy, but I have to say I pick Barr. I pick Barr first, right?  John Ratliff, right? But I have to tell you if we’re doing a remake of Perry Mason, the man I get, there’s nobody in Hollywood like this. John Ratcliffe. Right? Stand up, John. Such a great lawyer, incredible guy, incredible talent, but just a great lawyer that we appreciate it. He gets on that screen and everyone says, “I agree.” The other side folds up so fast. We’ll probably be using a lot of you in the next year. But you have been fantastic, John. We appreciate it. Thank you very much.  A man who is braver than me and braver than all of us in this room. He got, he got whacked. He got whacked. My Steve, right? I went to the hospital with our great first lady that night, right honey? And we saw a man that was not going to make it. He was not going to make it. He was the doctor and I told him his wife, I said, “She loves you.”  ” Why do you say that?”  “Because she was devastated.” A lot of wives wouldn’t give a damn. A lot of wives, a lot of wives would’ve said, “Hey, yeah.” I said, “How’s he doing?” Oh, she couldn’t even talk. She was inconsolable. Most wives would say, “Not good. Listen, I’m going home now.” But the doctor came in, the wife is like, she was a total mess. She was really devastated and it really looked like he had a 20, 25% chance. I think you set a record for blood loss. And Steve Scalise, I actually, honestly, I think you’re better looking now. You’re more handsome now. You weren’t that good looking. You look good now. He looks better now. Can you believe it? I don’t know what the hell that is. Better now. What a guy.  And he was practicing. He was practicing for the baseball game against, I guess the Democrats, right? And this whack job started shooting. Hurt Roger, I don’t know if Roger’s here, but hurt a number of people, hit them, but really hit Steve. Steve was at second base, he was the second baseman, and he went down and it was terrible. I mean, I saw the whole thing and it was terrible. And fortunately you had two brave policemen with you because of your high position in Congress.  You had two policemen and they were amazing. The man and the woman and they came and they didn’t have rifles. They were against a supposedly pretty good sharpshooter with rifles, good equipment. And all they had was a gun. And they started coming in from the outfield shooting. And they’re so far away that a handgun is not preferred. And this guy has the rifle and he’s hitting people. And he was going to move up and there was no out. I mean, if he would have been able to move up, there was no way to get out. The entrance was a single entrance way on the other side where he was.  So everyone went into the dugout, ran into the dugout, but Steve was really hit badly in the stomach with a bullet that rips you apart. It was supposed to do that. It rips you apart. And these two people came charging forward, boom, boom, boom. And one of them, you know who, one of them, him, got the shooter, hit him and then got him. Killed him from long distance. It was amazing. If you didn’t have those two people, you can imagine. Right? You can imagine what would happen. So Melania and I went to the hospital that night and he was in such bad shape and he’s been working ever since, so hard. But six months ago they had a baseball game at the National  and I’m watching and it’s on television. And it’s just, game, people, you want to win it. Right? And Steve’s at second base, the poor guy can’t even walk. Do you remember Bobby Richardson for the New York Yankees? He was known for range, Louie, range. He had the greatest range. If a ball’s hit to shortstop, Bobby Richardson’s the second player, second baseman. Bobby Richardson would field the ball. If it’s hit the first base he’ll throw it to the first baseman. He had unbelievable range. This was not Steve Scalise.  Steve had no range. One foot and he has to fall down. Right? Because he was trying to get better. I don’t know who the hell put you on the field, and this is a true story. So the game starts and the first pitch, Steve’s standing at second base and the guy is really in bad shape. And I said, “This is terrible.” A shot, ground ball, shot is hit to second. And Steve, I say, I didn’t have time to think too much, but I said, “This is not good. That ball is going toward him.” And this guy stopped that ball, caught the ball. He’s now laying down, he throws the ball to first base. He gets him out. I said, “It’s the most incredible thing. I’ve never seen athletic… I’ve never seen anything like it.” Right?  And he gets him out and they then took him out of the game, which was a very wise thing because you could never do that again in a million years, but you weren’t going to let that ball go through. I don’t care if it was hit by the greatest of all time. Right? That ball was not going through you because you are a warrior. Steve, he is fantastic. You are fantastic. You and Liz and Kevin. What a great, what a group. I mean what a group. I got lucky. I got lucky because you need the right people. If I had the wrong people there, maybe a different story. Maybe we’d be celebrating something else. But I really want to thank you Steve Scalise.  And Elise, you… I just read the story. She’s the most incredible. What’s going on with you Elise. So I even said, you know I was up campaigning for her, helping her. But I thought she looks good. She looks like good talent. But did I not realize when she opens that mouth you were killing them, Elise. You were killing them.  Elise, and there’s a big story in the New York Post. I really love the New York Post because they treat me well. There aren’t too many of you that do, but today you’re treating me well. I even had a great headline, New York Times, Washington Post, I had all these great headlines. Maybe we should just end it right there. But you had the greatest story yesterday in the Post that people from all over the country are contributing to her campaign. They were so enthralled with the way you handled yourself. What you said, the way you said it. And I’ll always be your friend. I think it was, it’s really an amazing story. What a great future you have. What a great future. Thank you. First Lady agrees by the way. First Lady agrees. And Michael Turner, you can represent me anytime. Where’s Michael? Where is he? Well, you can represent me. How good were you? Here’s another, here’s another Perry Mason type I think, right? What do you think John? But Micah, you were fantastic and we appreciate it.  Brad Wenstrup. Where’s Brad? Brad, great, great job. It’s a big day for the… And notice only the lawyers stayed. All the lawyers stayed behind. Lee Zeldin. How good are you? How good are you? Yeah. And Lou, your name’s not down. They didn’t give me your name. Do you know if… I didn’t announce Louie. Whoever the hell made this list, I got to get rid of them. Because if I wouldn’t have announced Louis, it might’ve been the end of the Presidency. Louie, you have been so great, so tough, and so smart. I got it. I got it. But Louie has been amazing. He’s a tough guy. He’s a smart guy. He’s streetwise like crazy. We love Texas. And we’re with you all the way, Louie. We’re with you all the way. Thank you very much.  So that’s the story. We have a great group of warriors and there are others left. And I guess probably, I’m sure I didn’t mention a few and I apologize if that’s the case. How’s ? My man, stand up please, will you? He’s the one who said, “You should run.” Right? Matt said, it’s like five years ago, six years ago, and I made a speech and then they do some kind of a straw poll. Who made the best speech? And he said I made the best speech. With all these professionals, but I hate to say this, with all these professional politicians, they voted by far the best speech was Trump. He calls me, he says, “You should run for politics.” I say, “What do I know about politics?” But you know what? We learned quickly and our country has never done better than it’s doing right now, so it’s pretty good. Thank you Matt. Great. .  So that’s the story. We’ve been treated very unfairly. Fortunately, we have great men and women that came to our defense. If we didn’t, this would have been a horrific incident for our country. When you have Lisa and Peter, the lovers, the FBI lovers, I want to believe the path you threw out for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. That’s the office. There’s no way he gets elected, meaning me. There’s no way he gets elected. This is Peter to Lisa. He’s probably trying to impress her for obvious reasons. There’s no way he gets elected, but I’m afraid we can’t take the risk.  Now think of this. In other words, if I get elected, they can’t… They, two low lifes, they can’t take the risk. They can’t take the risk. Think of it. And that’s where it came up. The greatest word of all, insurance policy. So he says, “But I’m afraid we can’t take the risk.” She mellows. It’s like an insurance policy. In the unlikely event you die before you’re 40. In other words, if I won, they were going to do exactly what they did to us. They were going to try and overthrow the government of the United States, a duly elected president.  And if I didn’t fire James Comey, we would have never found this stuff. Because when I fired that sleazebag, all hell broke out. They were ratting on each other. They were running for the hills. Let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. It’s in the hands of some very talented people. We’re going to have to see what happens. But I can tell you in my opinion, these are the crookedest, most dishonest, dirtiest people I’ve ever seen. They said, this has struck, “God, Hillary should win 100 million to one.”  This is about me. This is an agent from the FBI. Look how they let her off. 33,000 emails deleted. Nothing happens to her. Nothing happens. It’s unbelievable. But think of that, “God, Hillary should win.” When these guys are investigating Hillary. Then they go to work for Mueller, the two of them, and when Mueller found out that everybody knew that they were 100% this way, he let them go. But they deleted all of their emails and text messages. So when we got the phone, they were all deleted. Could you imagine the treasure trove they illegally deleted?  So they left. They left Bob Mueller. He had the look, but he didn’t have a lot of other things. Always had to look, Mr. G-Man. And I love the FBI and the FBI loves me. 99%. It was the top scum and the FBI people don’t like the top scum. So think of that 100 million to one, and he’s investigating me. And then, “God, Trump is a loathsome human being, isn’t he?” These are the people looking at me. I’m really not a bad person. And Paige said, “Yes, he’s awful.” How would you like to have that? This is just, this is the good stuff. There’s stuff a hundred times worse than that. These are all dirty people and now I just heard that they’re suing the United States of America because they were interfered with. Not going to let it happen. Just not going to let it happen. We cannot let this happen to our country.  So I’m going to leave now and I don’t know if any of you have anything to say. You could say it, but this is sort of a day of celebration because we went through hell and I’m sure that Pelosi and Crying Chuck, knowing this guy all the time, the only time I ever saw him cry was when it was appropriate. Known him for a long time, Crying Chuck. But I’m sure they’ll try and cook up other things. They’ll go through the state of New York, they’ll go through other places. They’ll do whatever they can because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do, in my opinion, it’s almost like they want to destroy our country. We can’t let it happen.  Jim Jordan, did you want to say something? Go ahead. Mark? Thank you. Thank you. This was a highly partisan situation. Pelosi said, I copied it down exactly, before the impeachment… She wanted to impeach from day one by the way, don’t let it fool you. She said, “No, the impeachment is a very serious thing.” I said, “She wants to impeach. Watch.” Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there’s something so compelling and so overwhelming and bi-partisan… Bi-partisan? It was 197 to nothing. And other than one failed presidential candidate, and I call that half a vote because he actually voted for us on the other one. But we had one failed presidential candidate. That’s the only half a vote we lost. So we had almost 53 to nothing. We had 197 to nothing. And the only one that voted against was a guy that can’t stand the fact that he ran one of the worst campaigns in the history of the Presidency.  But she said, “There’s something… There’s something, there has to be so compelling and so overwhelming and bi-partisan, I don’t think we should go down that path because it divides the country.” She was right about that. “And it’s just not worth it.”  That was Nancy Pelosi a year ago. Right? And I think it’s a shame. I think it’s a shame. But as I said, if we can this genius to work on roads and highways and bridges and all of the things we can do. Prescription drugs. We had… Secretary Azar is here and I want to thank him for this, but we had… First time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year. First time in 51 years. But what we can do working with both parties in Congress would be unbelievable. It’d be unbelievable what we can do. And I know Chuck Grassley is working very hard on it and Mitch is working very hard on it.  But what we can do is incredible. What we can do just generally. We’ve done so much without it. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve cut regulations at a level that nobody thought possible. We’ll always protect our second amendment. We all know that. But I just want to tell you that it’s an honor to be with you all. I want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony rotten deal by some very evil and sick people. And Ivanka is here and my sons and my whole family. And that includes Barron. That includes Barron who’s up there as a young boy. Stand up honey. Ivanka, thank you honey, . So, I just want to thank my family for sticking through it. This was not part of the deal.  I was going to run for President and if I won I was going to do a great job. I didn’t know that I was going to run. And then when I got in I was going to have to run again and again and again, every week I had to run again. That wasn’t the deal. But they stuck with me and I’m so glad I did it because we are making progress and doing things for our great people that everybody said couldn’t be done. Our country is thriving. Our country is just respected again, and it’s an honor to be with the people in this room. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Good music, but we have to get down to business. We’re in North Carolina, and they talk business. But I want to just thank everybody for being here. Wonderful crowd. Oh, look up there, look at all those people. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you to Ben, a special guy. He was very tough, you know, on the campaign trail. I had to fight him for a long time. He wouldn’t go away. He doesn’t give up. And he’s smart, and he’s good, and he was a great surgeon, and, I don’t know, he gave that up for politics? I’m going to have to talk to you about that. Where is he sitting? Where is he? Ma- you, why did, I’m going to talk to you about that later. Have to explain, I think he’s probably regretting that now. He’s doing an incredible job, an incredible job. You really are, Ben.  Housing. He’s done a job like few people have done it, but wonderful to be here with the incredible men and women who are restoring prosperity. That’s what you’re doing. Rebuilding hope and delivering opportunity to those who need it most. Together we’re making our country stronger than ever before. We are doing numbers that you wouldn’t even believe. Nobody would have thought it was possible. This morning the brand new jobs numbers came in. We smashed expectations and created 225 thousand new jobs last month. 225 thousand. They were thinking maybe 100, maybe 105. I was watching all the geniuses this morning on television. What do you think it’s going to be? It’s going to be 110. 225. Pretty good, right? 225 thousand for last month. That’s only last month.  Unemployment claims in North Carolina are down 30% since the election and have fallen to their lowest level ever recorded. Pretty good. And we’re here in Charlotte to expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum that we have going all over the country. You’re having the best year you’ve ever had in this state by far. Today we’re launching a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize underserved cities and towns all across America. It’s called Opportunity Now. Opportunity Now. It’s a big deal.  And you know we did with Tim Scott, Opportunity Zones, and they’re the hottest thing you’ve seen. Their money is pouring in, Tim from South Carolina, and the money is, anybody from South Carolina here? Huh? Say hello to Tim. He really did, he came to my office with this idea, and I said, “Sounds good.” But those things traditionally have not worked, and Opportunity Zones are, amazing what’s happened. Tremendous amounts of money being put into areas that hadn’t seen money for decades and decades.  Anyway, so what we’re doing is because we aren’t waiting for tomorrow and we aren’t deferring people’s dreams to another day, with relentless optimism we’re taking action right now, and I mean right now, to create a future of dignity and security for all. Going to be an incredible situation, you’ll see. And we believe in no American left behind. That’s what it’s all about. No American left behind. In the coming months my administration will hold summits just like this one in cities across the country, working closely with community leaders, workers, entrepreneurs, employers, and faith leaders, our great faith leaders, so many great people I’ve met. You know, we got ready of the Johnson Amendment so they can speak their will, right? Right? To make sure that every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise, together we’re building the most inclusive economy and the most inclusive society ever to exist. We’re fighting for great jobs, great education, safe homes, and a limitless future for our people. We’re lifting high citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We are all Americans and we are all made equal by the hand of Almighty God. You know that very well.  Joining us today is small business administrator Jovita Carranza, who is helping to lead this groundbreaking effort along with Secretary Carson. Jovita? Where is Jovita? Jovita. Good! Thank you, Jovita. Great job.  Thanks also to the many great members of Congress that you have with us, and these are warriors. These aren’t like, these people have been fighting hard. Do you mind if I take a mi- am I allowed to take a s- couple of seconds and introduce them? I call them warriors. Senators and Congressmen and women, but they’ve been incredible. You saw what happened. It was the impeachment hoax. And now that’s a thing of the past, so now they have a failed impeachment hoax. They can put that on their resume. That doesn’t go good on a resume, right? That’s a failed hoax. Every one of them have to put it right on that resume. It was a fix, except when it got up to Congress where we had 197 to nothing. Our Republicans hung in, and our tensors were incredible. They were really incredible, same kind of a thing, and a man’s here who’s really become a friend over the last year and a half, and we had a good relationship, but we sort of disagreed on a couple of minor policies, and that’s okay. Of course I won’t put up with it for long, Thom Tillis. He’s been a great friend.  It’s true. Now we just had some disagreements at the beginning, and now at the last year, year and a half, boy, it’s been good. Right? It’s been good, and you have something on sanctuary cities that’s going to be incredible. It got one of the big hands that, I know nobody listened to the speech yet tonight, but it got a big hand. Going to be good. You got to push that, right? So Thom, thank you, and thank you for your support. It was great, your vote and everything else, and we have some Congressmen. I’ve gotten to know them well. It’s like we were in the trenches together. Representative Ted Budd. Thanks, Ted. Good job. A man I campaigned with and he was fantastic. He handled pressure very well. They said you couldn’t win and he won by a lot. We did a little bit of a rally for two guys that are very special. One of them is Dan Bishop, Dan. Thank you, Dan. He campaigned and he didn’t choke. There was no choke. He had a lot of pressure but he ended up, won by, like, five or six points. It was, like, boring that evening. You were winning by too much. I thought it was going to be a lot closer than that, right? Richard Hudson, another one. Great. Richard, great. Good job.  Everybody knows Mark Walker. Thanks, Mark. Another one of those too that I talked about recently, you know, CNN, they all had their vans. They were all ready because they thought we’d have two losses, and they go out and say, “Trump had a terrible night.” But they both won. And this guy was pretty even, and I think he won by 28 points, right? It was like… Greg Murphy. Right, Greg? He won by a lot. They both won by a lot. A man that I’ve gotten to know too well. I love his wife. I mean, his wife, she was with me before he was with me, I have to say. But he came along very quickly. A long time ago, right? And she would go out with Women for Trump. They had buses. She had buses all over the place, right? Deb, where is she? Where’s our Deb? Oh, there. Well, I know them. Because they followed me around a little bit, right? They are incredible. They are incredible. How many have you come to, how many rallies have you? This isn’t a rally, you know. This is a serious deal. How many rallies, would you say? A lot. And we have a lot of fun. Thank you very much, hon.  Mark Meadows, everybody. Mark. Great guy. A man who is without question the greatest name in politics. I said, if I had his name, I would have been president at least 10 years sooner. Patrick McHenry. Right? Best name in politics. A woman who’s much tougher than any of these people. She doesn’t stop, right? Mark, she doesn’t stop. But she’s great. We love her. Virginia Fox. A very popular guy who wins elections by a lot. He’s a tremendous asset to Congress, and a tremendous friend, Ralph Norman. Ralph? Thank you, Ralph. We call him landslide Ralph, because he wins by a lot. William Timmons. William, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a man whose son I probably like even more than him, Allen. What a job Allen’s done. Joe Wilson is tough and smart and he is there all the time, and his son is just like him. His son is better than him, I think. Right? And he doesn’t mind. You know, I have a lot of fathers that, they don’t like it when I say that. I’ve had some, please don’t say that my son is better. They say, “You’re not a good father!” He’s a great father. And he’s proud of his son. His son’s fantastic, and he’s fantastic, and thank you very much. Thanks, Joe.  So we’re honored to be joined by North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who’s… big future. Big future. You got to get rid of the sanctuary city, Dan. You going to be able to do that? I think, right? A lot of people want to get rid of them. Plenty of people in California want to get rid of them. Believe me, it’s something. And we have many other state and local leaders from all across North Carolina. We’re thrilled to have you all here, and you’re the ones that really know best, and we’re spending a lot of time in this state. We’ll be coming here. Lewis is around someplace. Where’s Lewis? Lewis, the joy. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it. We’ll be coming here a lot. And we’re way up in the polls, but you know what I say? I pretend one point down everywhere. Somebody said, “How you doing?” I said, “Well, one point down everywhere.” But we’re way up. That’s what they tell me. Way up in North Carolina. Way up in South Carolina. Way, way up in South Carolina. Ralph? Way, way up. So anyway. So we just assume, it’s always good. I always say, “Pretend you’re one point down.” That way you work your ass off, right? We have to do that, because this is the most important election coming up. This election is, I used to say the other and the other. You know, the other is the other. 2016 was incredible. But you see what’s going on? You see what’s happening on the other side? They want to take everything away. They want to destroy everything we’ve built. We’ve got the most successful country in our history. They want to take it away. Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.  As I said in my State of the Union Address earlier this week, our nation is in the midst of the single greatest comeback that we’ve ever had. This is a comeback. We were doing poorly. And if you remember, it goes all the way back, for years I heard that China will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. I kept hearing that. I hated it, because I said, “If I run, 2019’s not so far away.” We are so far ahead. We are so far ahead now. We became a rocket ship, taking in billions and billions and billions in tariffs, giving a lot of it to our farmers and different people that we targeted. Now we have a deal with China. I just spoke to President Xi last night, and we’re working on the problem, the virus. It’s a very tough situation, but I think he’s going to handle it. I think he’s handling it really well. We’re helping wherever we can. But we have a great relationship. It’s incredible. They respect us again. They didn’t even respect us. What they were doing to us, they didn’t even respect us. They respect us again and we respect them. And we think, I think we have the best relationship we’ve had with China, but it’s really incredible.  So we signed the deal. We signed the Mexico Deal and Canada Deal, USM Deal. Signed a deal with Japan, $40 billion coming in. Signed a deal with South Korea, which had a terrible deal. That was a deal made by crooked Hillary Clinton. She said, 250 thousand jobs this will produce! It’s going to produce 250 thousand jobs! And she was right. For them. They got 250 thousand jobs. She never said that. She said 250 thousand jobs. Anyway, we changed it around. We said, “Sorry about that, but we’re changing this deal around.” For decades, Washington politicians put special interests ahead of American interests. They enacted disastrous trade, really, and I mean disastrous trade policies, like, it’s imaginable, frankly. I looked at some of these deals. I said, “Who the hell would have done this? Who would have done this? A child wouldn’t have agreed to this stuff.” Unbelievable. And we’re still here. You know, it’s pretty incredible when you think of it, but I don’t know that we would have been for long.  So we change them around, but the trade policies that shuttered our factories, gutted our communities, and shipped millions and millions and millions of jobs overseas and to other places. They spend trillions of dollars in the Middle East, but they allowed our own cities to crumble in total disrepair. You have a road. You have a bridge. You have a school. We build schools in Afghanistan. They blow it up. We rebuild it. They blow it up. We rebuild it. But if a school in South Carolina needed money, if a school in North Carolina needed money, if a school in Florida, any of the places, you know it right here, North, you can’t get money. But we get you the money. We get you the money. But they spend almost eight trillion dollars now in the Middle East. Terrible. Terrible thing. But we’re doing tremendous work and a lot of our soldiers are coming back home. You see it. You see what’s happening. They’re all coming back. They weren’t meant to be law enforcement. They weren’t meant to be law enforcement. They’re meant to be soldiers, you know. And we love our law enforcement, but we didn’t put the soldiers over there to be law enforcement.  And they impose crushing government burdens that punish working class Americans of all backgrounds. But not anymore. Those days have changed, and they’ve changed very quickly, and more so than you’re even hearing about. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building our country. From our inner cities to rural communities all over the land, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no longer, because we are finally putting America first. Took a long time, long time. A long time. Our economy is now the envy of the entire world, as you have to see when leaders come to my office, this beautiful Oval Office. I’ve had people walk into the office. It’s beautiful. But they have more beautiful in many cases, I guess, but it’s what it represents. They walk in, powerful people, big people, and you see them crying. I’ve seen heads of corporation walk in. Have you ever seen the Oval Office? “No, I haven’t.” How many times have you been in the White House. “51 times,” they’ve said, the head of a big car company, “51 times.” Huh. Have you ever seen the Oval Office. “No. They never took me.” I’ll take you in. I like showing it, all right? I’ll take you in. And you see them start to cry. Tough people. They haven’t cried since they were a baby, some of them never cried at all, even when they were a baby. And they start to cry when they walk into the Oval Office. Pretty amazing.  Since my election, America has gained seven million brand new jobs, including 220 thousand brand, brand, beautiful new jobs in a place called North Carolina. Isn’t that great? Great state. New business applications in North Carolina have surged by 30%. African-American workers have gained 1.3 million jobs. For the first time ever… think of this. For the first time ever, most new hires, that’s new jobs, are minorities and women. Think of that. First time ever. The unemployment rate has just hit, and has been for a little while, but just hit the lowest in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Think of that, the average rate. The average rate, and you’ve heard me say this many times, but I keep saying it, because I think people are really getting it and understanding what’s going on. This has been an incredible thing. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, Asian-American unemployment, have all reached the lowest levels in our country. I say it, because, you know. Very importantly, African-American youth unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded. African-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded, the best numbers we’ve ever had. Remember I used to say, “What do you have to lose?” I was in a room and it started, and I’m reading off economic numbers, the worst crime numbers, worst housing ownership numbers, worst everythi- just, worst education. Worst everything. I think there were nine or 10 different very major factors, African-American. I said, “You’ve been with the Democrats for 100 years,” 112 to be exact, but for over 100 years. And they treat you badly. And they only come around two months before the election. And then right after the election, they say, “Bye-bye. We’ll see you in two years or four years.” But they come around and they work real hard. They want your vote. And then the day after the election, they’re gone. That’s the Democrats. And I said, “Always bad numbers. What the hell do you have to lose?” I say it two ways. When I have a very sophistica-  What the hell do you have to lose? I say it two ways. When I have a very sophisticated, tough group like this, I say, “What the hell do you have to lose?” And when I have a very kind group, I know too many of the people in those , not so kind. But I say, “What do you have to lose?” It’s very much less effective when I say it that way. When I go, “What do you have to lose?” It’s like, let’s fall asleep. But when I say, but I remember I said it this night, I said, what… 25,000 people? I said, ” What the hell do you have to lose?” Place went crazy. Then I went off stage and my people told me, “I don’t know, that’s not nice.” I said, “No, it’s true.” It’s true. What do they have to lose? Right? They didn’t like it. They didn’t like it.  That’s why they’re all looking for jobs. We didn’t take . But I said, “No, we got to get the point across.” And we did well in the election, but now we’re doing numbers that I think maybe no Republican has done. We’re doing numbers, let’s see if that has to carry, November 3rd, we have to go to November 3rd. But the numbers have been incredible.  Thank you for putting on that beautiful hat. I love that hat, but thank you man. But it’s incredible. What you’re seeing now is incredible. It’s a Renaissance for African American, but for Asian American, for women, for everybody. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in history. Think of that. There’s a lot of people, they don’t have a diploma. They didn’t go to high school. They went to high school and they didn’t graduate, let’s say. And now they’re doing well. Low income workers have seen a 16% increase since my election. That’s in wages. That’s a record. This is a blue collar boom.  Wages for African American workers have increased by $2,400 per year. That’s a record. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%. that’s three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Larry Kudlow left. He said, “Please, please read this.” I say, “Who the hell is going to know what it means?” But you know what it means? It means that people that are really working hard that aren’t doing so well, haven’t done well, are doing proportionately better then people that are doing very well. It’s great.  Median household income reached the highest level ever recorded. Think of that one. Median household income. And think of it, President Bush for eight years, $450. President Obama for eight years, it’s $975. President Trump, and really when they did this stat, it was two and a half, now we’re at the three. We’re a little over three. Can you believe how fast we’re going? See? We’ll keep the rallies going. Don’t worry. Even if we win, even when we win next time we’ll do rallies. Okay? But no, think of it. So you have 450, you have 975, and now you have two and a half, but let’s say three years, instead of eight years. So it’s eight, eight and three. And with us, when you add the tax cuts and we add the regulation cuts, it’s close to $10,000, and that’s in a short period. That’s what’s fueling the boom. That’s what’s fueling the stock market. That’s why other countries aren’t doing well and we are.  And incredibly according to the Gallup Poll, no friend of mine, they tend to be slightly left of center, like about 200 degrees, 90% of Americans say they’re satisfied with their personal life, the highest percentage ever. I wonder what their definition of personal life is. I don’t know. It’s an a strange, that’s a strange poll, I’ve never heard of a pole like that. Are you happy with your personal life? Is everyone here happy with their personal life?  I know Mark Meadows is. No, it’s a strange… Paul, I’m trying to… If I give you definition of , had a lot of definitions you could get there. To lift up underserved communities across the nation, our tax cuts created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones. Again, Tim Scott, including more than 250 right here in North Carolina. So that’s something. 250 in North Carolina. Longterm investment in these communities is now taxed at zero. These deserving communities have not known opportunity in a long time, but now the investments are flooding in creating energy and creating excitement like they haven’t seen for a long time. One of the Americans benefiting from this gusher of new investment is a man who became very famous the other night because I introduced him during the State of the Union. Army veteran Tony Rankins of Cincinnati, Ohio. Good place. I had a summer job in Cincinnati. I worked in Cincinnati one summer. I did a good job. I did it a good job. I love Cincinnati. The Queen City. I love Cincinnati.  After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, his family, and he was homeless. He lost everything. But then Tony found a construction company that does work in opportunity zones, and the company saw Tony’s great skill and talent, helped him lift himself out of homelessness, break free of addiction, and these are great people. And they trained him for the new job. He didn’t need that much training either. Tony is now a top carpenter who renovates historic buildings in Cincinnati. He’s drug-free and he’s reunited with his family. And Tony, I’d love to have you come up and say a few words please. Tony. Tony Rankins. A lot of love. The fact is, he became very famous, so he’ll leave his job as a carpenter, he’ll go to California, become a movie star. You never know. Tony, thanks a lot. They really did. And they loved you the other night. Sat right next to my daughter, Ivanka, and great. Really great. The construction businesses is where Tony’s employed and working to help 200 people rise out of homelessness every year by investing in the opportunity zones. And now they’re coming to North Carolina to build housing for veterans in an opportunity zone right here in Charlotte. And I want to thank… I want to thank their founder and ask their founder, Travis Stephens, to please come up and say a few words. Please Travis. Thank you, Travis. You know, Tony got a much bigger hand than the boss. Right? Much bigger. . How did he do, Tony? Okay? Did okay? He did good, right? You did better. He did better. Thank you very much. And thank you Travis. And it’s 200 people I think, Travis. So that’s tremendous. 200. You’ll be up to a lot more than that. To further support opportunity zones I established the White House Opportunity and the Revitalization Council chaired by Secretary Carson. Ben’s worked very hard on it. Really hard. Its mission is to marshal 17 federal agencies and coordinate dozens of existing federal programs to provide maximum support to opportunity zones. Under my administration we’re working every day to restore the American promise of upward mobility. We don’t want anyone to just get by. We want everyone to get ahead and get ahead big league.  From the day I took off, I have been working to build an unlimited future for African American communities who have given, served, and sacrificed so much for our nation. Tremendous, tremendous amount. I’ve been fighting for higher wages, fair trade deal, safe communities, affordable healthcare, lower drug prices. This year, meaning last year’s numbers just came in, first time in 51 years where drug prices, prescription drugs, went down. First time in 51 years. And frankly, if the Democrats would ever negotiate instead of wasting all their time, we could drive those prices down so low. It would be so beautiful. I mean, what’s not to like?  We’re fighting for school choice and also criminal justice reform. You know, we got that done. Criminal justice reform. Big thing, we got it done. I will not rest, I will not stop, I will not give up until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity for every community in our land. We are not interested… It’s true. No, we’re not interested in business as usual. We’re not interested in continuing yesterday’s failures, of which there were many, or the old ways of doing things. We want to disrupt what’s broken. I want to really disrupt this place because none of the other stuff work.  When you look at the opportunity zones, how successful they’ve been, we’re doing things that are just really incredible. Now the economy’s helping I guess, and a lot of things are happening, a lot of good things are happening. But so many people are benefiting. We want to challenge what’s failed and focus on delivering real results, improving real lives, and making the world a better place for every American child no matter their place of birth or zip code or residence. No matter where they live, no matter where they come from.  Our commitment to opportunity now includes those who have been released from prison. This is the first time where prisoners are coming out and getting jobs and not having to go back. The percentage is unbelievably different. To give former prisoners the chance for a fresh start, last year I was proud to sign the landmark criminal justice reform into law. Took a lot of work. It was a very tough one. They’ve been trying to get it for a long time and other administrations couldn’t get it. We got it done. We get things done.  America is a nation that believes in redemption. People were in jail, you know Alice Johnson, she spent 22 years in jail. She had 18 or 20 left for something no good but not… It’s not a 40 or 50 year sentence. And she’s an incredible woman. You probably saw the ad we took at the Superbowl. I had another ad, we had two of them, and the first one was going to go in that spot. That was the best spot. That was right after the first time out. And this was one with jets and aircraft carriers and missiles all over the place. It was exciting. It was great. And I thought this was going to be just great.  And then we had the Alice Johnson ad. So we played the first one and I have one guy in particular who’s a tremendously talented person, and everybody just assumed the missiles and the planes, that was going to be the ad. And then we’ll put Alice back a little bit further frankly and not in as good… You have two spots. You can get one great spot. One not so great spot. This guy comes in, looks at both ads, he says, “The Alice Johnson head is unbelievable.” I said, “What about the aircraft carriers?” He said, “It’s fine but, you know, I’ve seen them before. You do them all the time actually. Right?”  And as soon as he said that I realized, and everybody is talking about that ad, Alice is a tremendous woman, tremendous person. And I said, “How many other women do you know in prison like that Alice?” She said many. I said, “Now do you know some that can’t come out?” Absolutely. Because I wanted to hear that too because that’s true also. But I said, “How many?” She said, “Many.” I said get me their names, just get me their name. She knows, she was in there a long time. 22 years she spent. A roaring economy is for the first time ever giving many former prisoners the ability to go out and get a great job. We’ve also made it a priority to encourage businesses to expand second chance hiring practices.  When my administration says, “Hire American,” we mean all Americans, every American. To help former inmates find housing, jobs, and support, my administration has established the Council on Crime Prevention and Reentry. Very big deal. Today I’m proud to announce that I’m appointing Tony Loudon, pastor of Maranatha Baptist Church. Where’s Tony? In Georgia. Tony? Where is Tony? Come on Tony. And Tony’s going to be our executive director. Tony, tell us a little about your work, please. Thank you. Wow. He’s done that before. He’s some pastor. That’s what the word is. Now I understand. We’re grateful to you, pastor. Thank you very much. All of our countries, African American churches, have done such an incredible job. Everything they do, they really raise the spirit of our people, they lift up the conscience of our nation. And we really appreciate you being here. That was beautiful. Thank you very much. My administration will always defend the cherished legacy and vital contributions of our African American churches. They are so vital, so important. To make the most of America’s boundless opportunities every American child deserves a great education. Yet for too long, countless American children have been trapped in poorly performing schools. That’s why it’s one of those things I talked about in the State of the Union address.  I highlighted the story of Janiah Davis, a fourth-grader from Philadelphia who was on the wait list for a School Choice Education Freedom Scholarship in Pennsylvania, along with 50,000 other Pennsylvania students. We got Janiah her second, really you call it a sort of a second chance. But we got her the school choice scholarship that she so desperately wanted with her mother. Her mother’s terrific. And now I want to ask Congress to pass legislation that would extend the same opportunity…  Ask Congress to pass legislation that would extend the same opportunity to 1 million American children, including 40,000 students right here in this incredible state, this incredible place.  Thank you. Thank you.  School choice. We all like school choice, right? Every child has the right to attend a great school. That’s what it is. They have a right. It’s catching on like a people wouldn’t believe. In my State of the Union, I also asked Congress to support my plan to offer vocational and technical education at every single high school in America.  We must be training our children so they have the skills to score well paying jobs, sometimes better paying than if they did it the traditional way. You know, when I was growing up, we had a lot of vocational schools and they’d teach auto mechanics and they’d teach brick laying and they teach all these great professions that make a lot of money. And I’d be in school with people and they didn’t love doing the traditional academics, but they could fix a car, an engine, a motor, they could fix it blind folded. They were unbelievably talented. They also liked doing it. That’s what they wanted to do. And we don’t really have that anymore. We call them junior colleges. And maybe that’s good, but I think the vocational school concept is what we really have to look at. They had tremendous talent. I’ll never forget. Tremendous talent.  I sat next to a one very young person at the time. That’s what he loved, that’s what he wanted to do. He had no interest in what we were doing, just none. And I had no interest in what he was doing, you want to know the truth. But he was unbelievable. He could fix anything and that’s what you have to do. You have to go with the aptitude in addition to everything else and they have tremendous aptitude, but there’s no place. And so, we’re going to go with a vocational school system where they can go out, actually make more money, and have something they really want to do.  My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to America’s workers spearheaded by a young woman that perhaps some of you may have heard of, Ivanka Trump.  Over 415 companies have committed, these are the big companies for the most part, have committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to nearly 15 million Americans. You know, when she started, she said, “Daddy, I want to help people get jobs.” This was at the beginning of the administration. She said, “I’m working on 500,000 jobs.” She’d call Walmart. She’d call all these great companies. She had a goal of 500,000, half a million jobs, sounds like a lot. I said, “That’s a lot.” She just broke 15 million jobs. Amazing. 15 million. And they’re not trained by government. Government can’t train them.  Look at what happened. I mean, look at … I love the state of Iowa. We just did very well in Iowa, by the way. We set a record, but nobody talks about that. What they do talk about the fact is the Democrats don’t know what the hell they’re doing. It’s true. Mark just got back. You’ll have to see these campaigns. They’ll spend 20-25 million dollar, let’s say, on average, but it’s really more than that. And they go out, they work and they work, they’ve been campaigning there for weeks. They even had to leave the impeachment hearing. I said, keep them here, you’ll get a real fast settlement. But they couldn’t do.  But, they go out and they work and they spend tens, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars, and the only thing they didn’t check to see whether or not the app worked. It didn’t. It fried all votes. They’re all fried. Now you have all these people fighting, “I was first,” “No, I was first.” They’re taking samples. They’re doing the vote by a sample. We got 2% of the vote, let’s see, who won. And it turned out to be Pete Buttigieg, who ever the hell that is, Mayor Pete. Explain that one to me. Someday you’ll go, “You’re going to explain that one to me, right?” Right? You people.  Now, do you ever see anything so crazy? They can’t count simple votes, but they want to fix your healthcare system. Think of it. Remember the Obamacare, right? Remember? It was going to cost 5 million. It costs 5 billion, right? 5 billion. It still didn’t work. Still didn’t work. But they have something going on in Iowa that sad actually, if you want, it’s embarrassing. Although, I’m not overly embarrassed by it. I see these shows this morning, they’re saying, “Oh, this is a disaster. Trump is going to kill us on this one.” They’re right. They’re right. All that time. All that time. Thank you. Now, if you want to drive them crazy, go 12 more years, 16 more years. They’ll drive them crazy. Look at all the fake news back there.  To expand equal opportunity, I’m also proud to report that my administration has achieved record and permanent funding. This is so important. Every year, historically black colleges and universities, for three years now, they’d come and see me. We need money and after two years I said, how come they come back all the time? That’s not nice. That’s not respectful of them. No, really. I really mean it. You understand, right? It’s not respectful. They come back every year. They give them a one year, the Democrats, they give them one year and then you’re supposed to come back hat in hand. And what I did… I won’t get any credit for it… They’ll take the credit, but you know, it’s one of those things that happens all the time. Criminal justice reform. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That is nice. I think so. I think we’re getting… Look, hey, we are in the oval office so I guess something happened, right? But it is too with criminal justice reform, they couldn’t get it. Nobody could get it. And a group of people, including Van Jones and others, came to the oval office, they came with Jared Christian, smart kid, smart guy, and they came to the oval office and they said, “We can’t get it. We need help.” I said, “Who do you need help with?” Some very tough senators like Tom. No, they need help with some very tough people there are senators. They needed to get over the line. They needed numerous senators, Republican senators, that weren’t so inclined. We had some that absolutely right from the beginning. Ted Cruz, right from the beginning. Mike Lee, very conservative, right from the beginning. But they needed help. There was no way they could… It was dead.  They came to see me, group of people headed by Van Jones, and they asked me for help. And I called six people and I explained it quickly and I got them to support it and it got passed. And you had another side that didn’t necessarily like it, but people are starting to like it now a lot because it’s fair. It’s just fair. And some states have done it. Texas has done it and Kentucky has done it. States that are known as being pretty tough on law and order.  I got it done. And about a week later I saw Van Jones making the speech and he was thanking everybody. I called my wife, I said, “Darling, I’m so proud of this. Come in. I’m sure he’s going to say nice things.” He never mentioned my name. I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton, I didn’t even know he was involved. I want to thank people that I’d never even heard of. He was thanking people. He never mentioned my name. I had somebody call him say, you don’t have to do that, but if it’s so tough, not fair, but you know you should do it. He apologized. He said he made a mistake, but he could have never gotten done without me. And sometimes in life, and you have to do this, if you’re not going to get credit, you might as well take it yourself because you’re the only one that’s going to get it. It’s true. It’s true. Right? Might as well.  You might as well take it yourself because they’re not going to give it to you. We’re very proud of it. But this was another one, historically black colleges and universities, and I said, it’s not fair. We put them down, as you know. Right? We put them down where they have long term. They don’t have to come back every year and beg. They don’t have to come back and beg every year. Right?  You were one of the guys. You mentioned it to me. It was just unfair. These are great schools. These are school that do a phenomenal job. If we didn’t have those schools, it would be terrible. Now they have a longterm deal. They’ve got the money and they can focus on education, right? And most importantly, we’re going to ensure that the HBCUs will always be an important part of our educational system because we were going to lose a lot of them. They couldn’t do this, they just couldn’t do it. They were hiring consultants, wise guys, right? Real wise guys. They were hiring consultants, I call it, who get percentages, who get a lot of money to go to Washington and lobby and work and this and that, and a lot of the percentage of the time spent was on spending and seeing congressmen, seeing senators, seeing people. And I said, we can’t do this. And these consultants would say, “Hey, you got to give us something that paid the consultant.” It’s just a waste of money. They didn’t do anything. I never spoke to a consultant about what we’re talking about. Right? We have it, you’re done for longterm and that’s the way it’s going to be. And we might as well let you have, but I’m very proud of that one. Thank you.  Previously federal law also restricted more than 40 faith-based HBCUs and seminars from fully accessing federal support, but my administration has stopped the federal government from discriminating against faith-based HBCUs and some of the best of them are faith-based. You know? Some of the best are faith-based. That’s a whole thing going on. It’s no good. I can’t do that.  As part of our relentless campaign to make life better for working families, I’ve asked Congress to pass legislation extending family leave to new parents nationwide so that every parent can spend critical time with their newborn or newly adopted child. And we’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare, enabling States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether. We have tremendous wait lists and those lists are way down. At the heart of our economic agenda is the conviction that for America to truly prosper, all of our communities must share in the gains. We’re making big gains and they have to share.  Together we’re bringing opportunity back to the places that need it most. We’re honoring the allegiance to the hardworking men and women whose faith, love, sweat, and sacrifice, make our country run. We are restoring the bonds of loyalty that unite us as Americans. No matter your party, no matter your politics, we’re fighting to deliver freedom, justice, inequality to every man, woman, and child in our land. We’re fighting to bring opportunity, dignity, and hope to every block in every neighborhood, all throughout this magnificent nation, and it is indeed a magnificent nation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.  With the help everyone here today, we are restoring the American dream for the American family. We’re giving a voice to those who were voiceless, and hope to those who felt hopeless. No part of this country will ever again be ignored, neglected, overlooked, or abandoned. We’re all united by a shared home, a shared destiny, and a shared devotion to our fellow citizens. We love our country. We are one American family. Thank you, darling. I love you too. She blew my best line, but would you stand up please. Where are you? I think you’re great. I love you too. Thank you very much. I was all set to really hit it, but I like that better.  But, we’re one American family. We rise together, we thrive together, and we win together. And thank you very much to all of those for your work, your drive, your commitment, your patriotism, your love for this nation. Our future has never been brighter, and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you very much. God bless you all. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a great honor to have you at the White House, a very special place. Beautiful and so meaningful in so many ways and our country has never done better. You’re all doing really well. Every state is doing well. I can say most every state in the room today is setting records and we’d like to think that the federal government has been helping you a lot, but it is wonderful being with you and we had a great evening last night, and the talent of those musicians, they could be anywhere in the world. Many of them could work in the great opera houses, but they loved the military.  When you heard the violins and the talent, the great talent, I don’t know if anybody has an ear for music. Believe it or not, a long time ago, I was told I have a great ear for music by somebody. I took a test. They said, “He has a wonderful aptitude for music.” I said, “I do?” But would you listen to that? It’s really incredible, the talent, and they’re great people. They want to be in the military. They don’t want to be anywhere else. So it’s really, really something.  As I said in my State of the Union last week, we’re in the midst of a great American comeback with the help of many of the people in this room, and you’ve done really a fantastic job. I think I can say just about everybody. I’ll say just about just in case some day somebody’s going to run or do something that I won’t like and I can have a little bit of an out when I say just about. I said, “No, he was included in the just about.” But we’re creating the most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society ever to exist, actually.  Since my election, America’s gained seven million new jobs. We added 225,000 jobs in January alone, crushing expectations. The unemployment rate reached the lowest level in 50 years, and a statistic that’s incredible to me is the average unemployment that we’ve had during this three-year period is the lowest of the history of our country compared to any other administration. The lowest of the history of our country. The unemployment rate for African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest level ever recorded.  Low income workers have seen a 16% pay increase since my election. Something that’s so great to see. When I campaigned, they hadn’t had rate increases, pay increases, for 20 years, 21 years. They were working three jobs and two jobs and making less money than they’d been made 20 years ago. Median household income, as you all know very well, is the highest ever recorded by far. Since 2016, 28 states have reached or matched their lowest unemployment rate on record. So we have 28 and I think soon we’re going to have just about everybody.  And at the end of last year, a record 39 states had unemployment below 4%. Again, another record. Just as I promised during my campaign, we’re fighting every day to expand opportunity for African-American communities all across our country. African-American youth, we have such great news on African-American youth. Unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded. It’s a great statistic. African-American poverty rates have plummeted to their lowest rate ever in history and wages for African-American workers have increased $2,400 a year. That’s also a record.  At the center of our economic agenda, or opportunity zones, I hope you’re embracing them. I think many of you are. My administration has worked with the governors in this room to create nearly 9,000 opportunity zones in our most vulnerable communities. Jobs and money are pouring into these areas that have never seen investment. I mean, they haven’t seen them in decades and decades and decades, and hundreds of millions of dollars are pouring into certain communities, individual communities, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it’s never been anything like it. Opportunity zones. Tim Scott did a great job on that. Senator Tim Scott.  I urge all governors to create a state-level version of our White House opportunity and revitalization council to coordinate the efforts of state government to provide maximum support for the opportunities and say, “We’re there to help you. If you have a problem, call me, literally call me and we’ll work it out.” But the opportunity zones, and that’s Democrat or Republican, by the way, opportunities have been fantastic. We must not stop until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity for every community in our land, and that’s what’s happening. To give former prisoners a second chance.  This has worked better than any program, ever. I was proud to sign the landmark criminal justice reform into law, and since that time, 10 states have passed legislation following our lead and there were numerous states, I know Texas was there, governor with criminal justice reform. Amazing. And Kentucky and few others that were thought of as being very strict states, and yet they had criminal justice reform. We looked at a lot of what Texas did and some of the other states, what worked so well. Alice Johnson is an example. She was in for 22 years and she had another 20 years to serve on something that everything’s bad, but to be in jail for 40 and 50 years for what Alice did on a telephone was crazy.  Thanks to our roaring economy, former inmates are now finding jobs and the employers are so happy now. The economy is really helping, but it’s the first time ever we’re prisoners coming out of jail are finding jobs, loving it, and the employers, the feedback we’re getting from so many people, so many employers are, these are among the best people they have and they were in a way forced by the economy, the good economy, because it’s hard to get people. Down to 3.5, and actually, it went to 3.6 because we’re opening up the valve, they’re hiring more and more people.  There was a positive, 225,000 as I said, but the prisoners are now working and they’re doing a phenomenal job, for the most part. Our booming prosperity is being fueled by our historic regulatory reduction campaign and my first month in office, I imposed a two-for-one rule requiring for every one new regulation, two old ones must be eliminated. Well, that turned out to be … We went to four, we went to six, we went to eight. We had a period where we were at 22:1, 22:1, and we’re eliminating on average $3,100 in regulation cost per family a year. Nobody’s ever even heard of such a thing, and we’re getting housing bill, too.  We have rules and regulations, made it impossible. I hope California gets their act together because the cost of regulations is almost the cost of a house and they need housing and they can’t build it. They don’t know what they’re doing. The governor’s initiative or regulatory innovation is designed to continue our unprecedented progress through straight estate level deregulation. Governor Doug Ducey has achieved three for one on cuts … Where’s Doug? Good job, Doug. Well, he only won by about 17%, so, you know, he should be doing good. In fact, at 17%, you should be at 4:1, I think, right? That’s a big win, big one. That was a great win.  And Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma has reached two for one and going to three for one. Where’s Kevin? Hi, Kevin. Good job. Great. We’re also working together … And many of you in the room have done much better than one-for-one, much better. Some of you are up to four. We’re also working together to reform occupational licensing. Just this year at least 12 governors have taken action to reduce burdensome occupational licensing requirements. That means licensing where either it’s unnecessary, or where you actually can do it very quickly.  There are some licensing requirements that takes years to get approved and it could take a matter of days, could take a matter of days. Governors understand the need to get infrastructure projects quickly approved to speed up permitting and reduced traffic congestion. Last month, we issued a proposed new rule to reduce permitting and the permitting time for new infrastructure by more than 70%. Highways that were taking 12 years to get approved, 14, 15, 17, 21 years. We’re trying to get it down to one year.  That means you may get rejected if you have an environmental problem or safety problem. In many cases, these highways became much more unsafe and they took a long time because they try and get away from certain problems, including nesting, but they try and get away and instead of having a straight run, they’d create curves in the highway, which obviously, make it much more dangerous. And they had problems with some of those highways and they’re much more expensive to build.  Not only the time, the design, but the time. I mean, by the time they get an approved. So, we have highways that would take 21 years. We have roads that took 10 years, 11 years, 12 years to get approved. And Elaine Chao has been fantastic. Elaine, thank you very much. The job you’re doing with transportation, we appreciate it very much. And Jeff, you were over there for a long while. I will tell you, so I have to give you at least partial credit. Right now, you’re at a different location, but you really did. You did a great job on that.  So we have it down to two years now, but I think we’re going to get it down to one and very good chance you’ll be rejected if it doesn’t meet environmental standards and tests. And we are rescuing students from failing government schools by introducing the Education, Freedom, Scholarships and Opportunity Act, which will replicate the great success of tax credit scholarships available in 18 states. We believe very strongly, or at least many of the people in this room, not all of them, but believe very strongly in school choice. We’re also working closely with the States to improve public safety.  This includes the incredible work being done by our nation’s heroic ICE officers. We’ve moved thousands of MS-13 out of the country back to where they came from, whether it’s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. And as you know, we reached agreements with those countries so that we can do that. And the past administration, they wouldn’t accept them. They come from one of the countries, tough countries, and we would send them back and they wouldn’t take them. Not me. They take them now. Now they say, “Thank you so much for sending them back. We were looking for this killer. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.”  But they all take them now. They take them very quickly before they used to say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that airplane. We don’t want those people.” So they take them back rapidly. Some day, they’ll tell the real story as to why, but that’s the way it has to be. We have thousands and thousands of killers and gang members that we’re bringing back to countries that now accept them. They were not taking them back. Last year alone, ICE officers arrested 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.  Now, some of them we keep here when they … It’s very egregious. We don’t necessarily trust other people to take care of justice, so we keep them here. But we don’t like having people in our prisons for 50 years, 60 years, and we have to pay for it. And so, for the most part, we bring them back to their countries and give them a very bad recommendation. State and local cooperation is the backbone of this effort. We have a tremendous relationship with-  It is the backbone of this effort. We have a tremendous relationship with many of the states and governments, cities. It’s essential that all of our states and cities honor ICE detainer requests to ensure that safe transfer of criminal aliens into federal custody takes place. Jurisdictions that adopt sanctuary policies and instead release these criminals, put all of Americans in harm’s way. A very, very serious problem. I mean we’re all here for the same thing. I know we have different policies, different feelings, different everything, but sanctuary cities are causing us a tremendous problem in this country. We have stone cold killers that they don’t want to hand over to us and then they escape into communities and they cause in some cases tremendous havoc.  Another vital element of federal and state cooperation is the relentless fight against opioids and the drug epidemic. We’ve had great progress. We’re down 1819 and 20% in some of the communities. First Lady’s been very much involved in that. Kellyanne has been very much involved in that. A lot of the people in this room, almost everybody in this room has been involved in it. And I want to thank you for that. We’re making progress. Very tough, all over the world. This is a problem all over the world. This is big problem here, but it’s a big problem almost everywhere.  For the first time in three decades, we’ve achieved a decline in drug overdose deaths, including as an example, Ohio. Mike is around here someplace. Mike. Mike, Mike, 23% in Ohio. 19% in Pennsylvania. 10% in Wisconsin, and we’re averaging probably about 16, 17%, so it’s been… it’s not enough, but we’re making a lot of progress and if we had more help in Congress, we could get it even lower.  My administration is truly grateful for the leadership, cooperation, partnership, and friendship of the governors in this room. No matter our party, we must work together and really do the job and I think that’s what’s happening. Our country is now receiving thousands and thousands of companies that are coming into the United States. Some had left and some had never been here before, but they all want to be where the action is. We lost 60,000 plants and factories over the year, 60,000. It’s hard to even conceive and we’ve got many of them back and many are coming back and they’re moving to a lot of your states. I know a lot of them are coming into Texas and Florida and a lot of different locations. South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania. It’s incredible what’s happening. Ohio is a big beneficiary.  Michigan is a tremendous beneficiary with the car companies, tremendous. Somebody was saying they’re so happy in Michigan. And I meet with a Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, “Shinzō you have to get more car companies here. We have a deficit with you. You have to get them in.” And they are. They’re sending a lot of companies. We hadn’t built a plant in years and years, in decades frankly. And now we have car plants being built all over the United States and we have expansions, a lot of expansions of existing plants. So it’s been really an incredible thing.  We’re doing incredible work and we’re the number one country in the world right now in terms of the economy. When I was running and long before I was running, I’d always heard that China, have great respect for President Xi and great respect for China frankly, but that China was going to be the number one economy in the world during 2019. Actually it was 2018, 2019, you all heard it, that we were going to go to number two. And I will tell you we had our battle and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and other things and you saw the… it was just announced, the trade deficit was the lowest it’s been in years with China. Just happened two days ago. They just announced. But we are now so far ahead of China in terms of the size of our economy that if somebody is smart that’s at this position for times into the future, hopefully after five years, I won’t joke by saying 9, 13, 15 it drives them crazy. For the governors it drives them… even when I joke, it drives them crazy. So I won’t say that.  But if somebody smart is in this position, it’ll never happen, which I know over Texas, it’ll never happen. So we right now have… we’re so far ahead of them. They’re not catching us for a long time. If the wrong person stands here or sits in the White House, that beautiful chair in the White House, in the Oval Office, sure they’re going to catch you. They have 1.5 billion people. We have 350 million people, but we have a very special place and a very special country and nobody’s going to catch us if we have great leadership. And you have been great leaders for your states and we appreciate very much that you’re at the White House. Thank you very much.  So what we’re going to do is I thought maybe we could take a few questions if you want. We could leave the press there. The press would love that, I’m sure. Or we could have them leave and we could talk in a different fashion. You won’t have to show boat. So would anybody preference. We’ll leave them here for a little while and then we’ll go a different route perhaps. Any questions, please? Please. We’re doing a big infrastructure potential deal. We need, obviously, we need help from… we need the votes of Democrats. They’ve been so focused on something else and wasting a lot of people’s time. Although my poll numbers have been driven way the hell up, so that’s one way to do it I guess. But they have been so focused on the impeachment hoax that they haven’t had time to do anything else, but we’re ready to go with a big infrastructure bill, if they’re ready to approve it.  We’re also ready to lower drug prices very substantially. We did last year was the first time in 51 years that drug prices, prescription drug prices went down first time in 51 years. But to get them really down, we have to do exactly what we’re doing, where we have… we need the votes of the Democrats and they just didn’t have the time to do anything. So maybe they will now have the time, but we’re all ready to go on infrastructure, on reducing drug prices. Very substantial. We can reduce drug prices unbelievably easily and substantially, but we have to get Democrat votes. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Governor. Please. Europe has been treating us very badly. European Union was really formed so they could treat us badly, so they’ve done their job. That was one of the primary reasons, but they treat us badly there and they treat us badly frankly on NATO. But NATO I’ve gotten, as you know, $130 billion more they will pay because NATO was going down like a rocket ship. Our past leaders would go over and make a speech and leave. I went over, made a speech and said, “You got to pay more,” because the United States was paying everything. Essentially they were paying close to 100% and I let them know you have no choice and they are paying more. They paid 130 billion.  I think my biggest fan of the whole world is Secretary General Stoltenberg, head of NATO. He said he can’t believe it, because for 20 years it went down. It’s like a roller coaster there. No, no… none of this just down. They paid less and less and less and it got more expensive and more expensive with time. But I raised $130 billion my first meeting and I raised 400 billion my second meeting. So now it’s in good shape. But we were taken advantage of by a lot of countries, a lot of allies frankly. Sometimes allies do a better job on you than the enemy, because the enemies you watch out for, right?  So Pete, I think that the next thing could be Europe where we talk to them very seriously and they have to do it, because there’s been, over the last 10 12 years, there’s been a tremendous deficit with Europe. They have barriers that are incredible. I didn’t want to do them while we were doing China, Japan, South Korea. I didn’t want to do the whole world at one time. Does that make sense? People have learned that doesn’t work out too well, even on trade.  So we’re going to be starting that. They know that. They know that. They’re ready for it. We made a good deal with Japan. We’re going to do a bigger, much more comprehensive deal, but we’re taking in 40 billion from Japan, which they didn’t expect. Nobody expected. We’ve done great on the trade. It’s going to have a tremendous impact.  Now the virus that we’re talking about having to do… a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away at April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases, 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now. So, but a very good question. Yes, please, Colorado. Well, we almost had a deal on that with the Democrats as you know. It was done. And then we lost a decision and the Democrats said, “Trump, who’s that? Trump, who’s that?” But we were very close to having a deal on the dreamers with the House and with the Senate, would have been very good deal for everybody. And so we’re looking at that.  But now we’re before the Supreme Court. I think we’re going to win, because if we don’t win, that gives the President of the United States unbelievable powers. President Obama signed that bill, it was an executive order. And when he signed that, he said essentially he said, “I don’t have the right to do this, but I’m going to do it anyway.” And he was upheld by a judge and anyway, it’ll be before the Supreme Court pretty soon and at some point I think we’ll probably make a deal on that. I do feel that way. Okay, good question. Question. Yes please. Gary. How’s Mitt Romney? You keep them. We don’t want him. Go ahead. Doing a great job in Utah by the way. Go ahead Gary. Yeah, I agree. We’re putting out a plan today that over a period of… not that long a period of time, brings our budget and our deficit down to what it should be, which is close to zero. And I think people are going to be very impressed by it. We’re not touching Medicare. We want to keep Medicare. We’re not touching social security. We’re making our country stronger again. We’re not decreasing Medicaid, but we’re doing a lot of things that are very good, including waste and fraud, tremendous waste and tremendous fraud. So what we’re doing that, in terms of certain programs. And we’re taking good care of our military, we’re increasing spending on our nuclear program, because we have no choice, because of what China is doing, what Russia is doing in particular. And so we have a very big number in for that. Now, at the same time, Russia and China both want to negotiate with us to stop this craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars nuclear weapon.  … This craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars on nuclear weapons, but the only way until we have that agreement, the only thing I can do is create by far the strongest nuclear force center in the world. Which as you know, over the last three years, we’ve very much upgraded our nuclear, but we’re buying new, we have the superfast missiles, tremendous number of the superfast. We call them superfast, where they’re four, five, six and even seven times faster than an ordinary missile. We need that because again, Russia has some, I won’t tell you how they got it. They got it supposedly from plans from the Obama Administration when we weren’t doing it. And that’s too bad. That’s not good. But that’s how it happened. And China, as you know, is doing it.  We have a tremendous $740 billion for military. But again, it’s also jobs in the United States. So it’s everything’s made in the United States proudly. And we have the best in the world. We have the best equipment in the world, the best missiles, planes, rockets. Everybody wants our equipment. We have to be very selective obviously, but we’re going to have a very good budget with a very powerful military budget because we have no choice about that. Ron, do you have something about, for instance, your plan of buying and cutting prescription drugs? You want to tell them what we’re doing? You can go, and Colorado is doing that, also, you can go to certain countries and the exact same pill made in the exact same plant, factory wherever it may be from one of the big companies, will sell for 50%, 60%, 70% less than the United States is paying because it’s broken. It’s a broken system. And so one of the things I’ve authorized is that certain states have requested probably after this, everybody in this room will go back, but, but if we buy from Canada, you’ll save 50% at this moment.  Now that may go up or everything may come down. One thing is going to happen or another, either the drug companies are going to raise it and not make it possible to buy. They’re going to raise it in Canada, meaning so you won’t be able to do it. Or everyone’s going to go down because they have a middleman in the middle of that are making a fortune. Nobody knows who these people are, but they’re getting rich because we had a broken system and it’s about time it gets fixed.  So a lot of shakeup is going to take place, but if we had Democrats helping us, we could solve this problem in one day, but they don’t want to vote. Again, they don’t have any time to vote. They don’t have any time to do anything other than what they do. So they seem to be freed up a lot now. They’re freed up a lot actually I hear. How about a couple of more and then we’ll let the press go and relax and take it easy. Please, Governor. Thank you. Yes. So as you know, it’s gone down. I met with President Xi on the trade deal. And I said, “You have to stop fentanyl coming into our country. You have to do me a favor and stop it. You have to get it stopped. It has to end because it’s a favor for our country and we’re losing thousands and thousands of people to fentanyl.” I mean, the size of a pinhead can kill a lot of people. It’s unbelievably bad and they send it direct and they sent it through Mexico and through the border and we would catch a lot of it, but even if a little bit got through, it’s a very deadly drug. And they have cut it way back and they’ve also criminalized… It wasn’t a criminal, they considered a corporate kind of a thing. It was a drug of a different nature and now they put it into their criminal statutes and criminal in China for drugs, by the way, means that’s serious. They’re getting a maximum penalty. And you know what the maximum penalty is in China for that and it goes very quickly.  It’s interesting, where you have Singapore, they have very little drug problem. We have China, they have very little drug problem. States with a very powerful death penalty on drug dealers don’t have a drug problem. I don’t know that our country is ready for that, but if you look throughout the world, the countries with a powerful death penalty, death penalty with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem that includes China. But they’ve put fentanyl now into there, he’s working on that and it’s gone down a lot as you know. They put it into their penalty system and people will be getting the death penalty in China now for fentanyl. It was a big thing. It’s not part of the trade agreement, but it is part of the trade agreement. And they have acted on it.  Now, of course they’re working on something else and I think they’re doing a good job on that. On the virus. Had a long talk with President Xi for the people in this room two nights ago and he feels very confident. He feels very confident. And he feels that, again as I mentioned by April or during the month of April, the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus. So that would be a good thing. But we’re in great shape in our country. We have 11 and the 11 are getting better. Okay, so great question. I think that fentanyl is a huge problem. It’s almost at this moment to 100% made in China and they are starting to enforce it on our behalf. We have a good relationship with China now. Probably the best we’ve ever had. So I think what we’ll do, any other questions from the governors? Yes please. So we did a big thing on healthcare. We got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which basically made Obamacare not Obamacare anymore. It was the most unpopular thing in Obamacare and basically you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not paying to have bad healthcare and nobody wanted that. And we got rid it, big, big move and I had a choice. I can make so it really isn’t Obamacare anymore but, we do as you know we left preexisting conditions and everything. We left it because preexisting we’ll always have, and I think I can speak for Democrats too, but we are all going to have preexisting conditions. We are always going to make sure that that’s taken care of, the preexisting condition situation.  I think I can speak, I know I can speak for Republicans. I think I can speak for Democrats. It’s a part of our society right down. Nobody’s going to change it. If a law is overturned, that’s okay because the new law is going to have it in the new law would replace the old law that was overturned it would have preexisting conditions. So I think that’s important to say. But one thing that we will be doing is, at least from a Republican standpoint, you have 180 million people out there that have great health insurance. They love it, private health insurance, and we’re going to save it.  Other people are thinking about terminating it, which is brutal for unions and others. So I don’t know how they’re going to get around that, but we’re going to be saving that. But when I took over, I had a choice. So we got rid of the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, almost got rid of Obamacare but essentially we did. But now I said, “Do we run it really well or do we run it really poorly? Do we make everybody unhappy and blame the Democrats or do we make people relatively happy with a bad law?” It’s a bad law, it’s bad policy, but do we make people relatively happy. And I chose, I felt I had an obligation to do the latter. So it’s been working out pretty well and it goes along and we’ve done block grants, we’ve done a lot of different things with different states and it’s tailor made for different states.  We are doing things for states. Some people want block grants, some people want something else. And we’re working with individual states and I think governors are really happy and really surprised that we’re doing that. I could have just a cold lined it and just said we’re not doing anything and everybody would be happy. Everybody would be complaining. But I think the best thing for our country to do is the way we’re doing it until we get a replacement for Obamacare, a full replacement that’s going to be great. And I would say this, if we change the House, if we get the House, the Republicans get the House back, we will have that.  Otherwise we’ll just have to negotiate with the Democrats. And I think at some point they’ll come around and start negotiating these things because they really are good. So media, thank you very much we appreciate it and we’ll have a little more discussion. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a great honor to have you at the White House, a very special place. Beautiful and so meaningful in so many ways and our country has never done better. You’re all doing really well. Every state is doing well. I can say most every state in the room today is setting records and we’d like to think that the federal government has been helping you a lot, but it is wonderful being with you and we had a great evening last night, and the talent of those musicians, they could be anywhere in the world. Many of them could work in the great opera houses, but they loved the military.  When you heard the violins and the talent, the great talent, I don’t know if anybody has an ear for music. Believe it or not, a long time ago, I was told I have a great ear for music by somebody. I took a test. They said, “He has a wonderful aptitude for music.” I said, “I do?” But would you listen to that? It’s really incredible, the talent, and they’re great people. They want to be in the military. They don’t want to be anywhere else. So it’s really, really something.  As I said in my State of the Union last week, we’re in the midst of a great American comeback with the help of many of the people in this room, and you’ve done really a fantastic job. I think I can say just about everybody. I’ll say just about just in case some day somebody’s going to run or do something that I won’t like and I can have a little bit of an out when I say just about. I said, “No, he was included in the just about.” But we’re creating the most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society ever to exist, actually.  Since my election, America’s gained seven million new jobs. We added 225,000 jobs in January alone, crushing expectations. The unemployment rate reached the lowest level in 50 years, and a statistic that’s incredible to me is the average unemployment that we’ve had during this three-year period is the lowest of the history of our country compared to any other administration. The lowest of the history of our country. The unemployment rate for African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-Americans have reached the lowest level ever recorded.  Low income workers have seen a 16% pay increase since my election. Something that’s so great to see. When I campaigned, they hadn’t had rate increases, pay increases, for 20 years, 21 years. They were working three jobs and two jobs and making less money than they’d been made 20 years ago. Median household income, as you all know very well, is the highest ever recorded by far. Since 2016, 28 states have reached or matched their lowest unemployment rate on record. So we have 28 and I think soon we’re going to have just about everybody.  And at the end of last year, a record 39 states had unemployment below 4%. Again, another record. Just as I promised during my campaign, we’re fighting every day to expand opportunity for African-American communities all across our country. African-American youth, we have such great news on African-American youth. Unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded. It’s a great statistic. African-American poverty rates have plummeted to their lowest rate ever in history and wages for African-American workers have increased $2,400 a year. That’s also a record.  At the center of our economic agenda, or opportunity zones, I hope you’re embracing them. I think many of you are. My administration has worked with the governors in this room to create nearly 9,000 opportunity zones in our most vulnerable communities. Jobs and money are pouring into these areas that have never seen investment. I mean, they haven’t seen them in decades and decades and decades, and hundreds of millions of dollars are pouring into certain communities, individual communities, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it’s never been anything like it. Opportunity zones. Tim Scott did a great job on that. Senator Tim Scott.  I urge all governors to create a state-level version of our White House opportunity and revitalization council to coordinate the efforts of state government to provide maximum support for the opportunities and say, “We’re there to help you. If you have a problem, call me, literally call me and we’ll work it out.” But the opportunity zones, and that’s Democrat or Republican, by the way, opportunities have been fantastic. We must not stop until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity for every community in our land, and that’s what’s happening. To give former prisoners a second chance.  This has worked better than any program, ever. I was proud to sign the landmark criminal justice reform into law, and since that time, 10 states have passed legislation following our lead and there were numerous states, I know Texas was there, governor with criminal justice reform. Amazing. And Kentucky and few others that were thought of as being very strict states, and yet they had criminal justice reform. We looked at a lot of what Texas did and some of the other states, what worked so well. Alice Johnson is an example. She was in for 22 years and she had another 20 years to serve on something that everything’s bad, but to be in jail for 40 and 50 years for what Alice did on a telephone was crazy.  Thanks to our roaring economy, former inmates are now finding jobs and the employers are so happy now. The economy is really helping, but it’s the first time ever we’re prisoners coming out of jail are finding jobs, loving it, and the employers, the feedback we’re getting from so many people, so many employers are, these are among the best people they have and they were in a way forced by the economy, the good economy, because it’s hard to get people. Down to 3.5, and actually, it went to 3.6 because we’re opening up the valve, they’re hiring more and more people.  There was a positive, 225,000 as I said, but the prisoners are now working and they’re doing a phenomenal job, for the most part. Our booming prosperity is being fueled by our historic regulatory reduction campaign and my first month in office, I imposed a two-for-one rule requiring for every one new regulation, two old ones must be eliminated. Well, that turned out to be … We went to four, we went to six, we went to eight. We had a period where we were at 22:1, 22:1, and we’re eliminating on average $3,100 in regulation cost per family a year. Nobody’s ever even heard of such a thing, and we’re getting housing bill, too.  We have rules and regulations, made it impossible. I hope California gets their act together because the cost of regulations is almost the cost of a house and they need housing and they can’t build it. They don’t know what they’re doing. The governor’s initiative or regulatory innovation is designed to continue our unprecedented progress through straight estate level deregulation. Governor Doug Ducey has achieved three for one on cuts … Where’s Doug? Good job, Doug. Well, he only won by about 17%, so, you know, he should be doing good. In fact, at 17%, you should be at 4:1, I think, right? That’s a big win, big one. That was a great win.  And Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma has reached two for one and going to three for one. Where’s Kevin? Hi, Kevin. Good job. Great. We’re also working together … And many of you in the room have done much better than one-for-one, much better. Some of you are up to four. We’re also working together to reform occupational licensing. Just this year at least 12 governors have taken action to reduce burdensome occupational licensing requirements. That means licensing where either it’s unnecessary, or where you actually can do it very quickly.  There are some licensing requirements that takes years to get approved and it could take a matter of days, could take a matter of days. Governors understand the need to get infrastructure projects quickly approved to speed up permitting and reduced traffic congestion. Last month, we issued a proposed new rule to reduce permitting and the permitting time for new infrastructure by more than 70%. Highways that were taking 12 years to get approved, 14, 15, 17, 21 years. We’re trying to get it down to one year.  That means you may get rejected if you have an environmental problem or safety problem. In many cases, these highways became much more unsafe and they took a long time because they try and get away from certain problems, including nesting, but they try and get away and instead of having a straight run, they’d create curves in the highway, which obviously, make it much more dangerous. And they had problems with some of those highways and they’re much more expensive to build.  Not only the time, the design, but the time. I mean, by the time they get an approved. So, we have highways that would take 21 years. We have roads that took 10 years, 11 years, 12 years to get approved. And Elaine Chao has been fantastic. Elaine, thank you very much. The job you’re doing with transportation, we appreciate it very much. And Jeff, you were over there for a long while. I will tell you, so I have to give you at least partial credit. Right now, you’re at a different location, but you really did. You did a great job on that.  So we have it down to two years now, but I think we’re going to get it down to one and very good chance you’ll be rejected if it doesn’t meet environmental standards and tests. And we are rescuing students from failing government schools by introducing the Education, Freedom, Scholarships and Opportunity Act, which will replicate the great success of tax credit scholarships available in 18 states. We believe very strongly, or at least many of the people in this room, not all of them, but believe very strongly in school choice. We’re also working closely with the States to improve public safety.  This includes the incredible work being done by our nation’s heroic ICE officers. We’ve moved thousands of MS-13 out of the country back to where they came from, whether it’s Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. And as you know, we reached agreements with those countries so that we can do that. And the past administration, they wouldn’t accept them. They come from one of the countries, tough countries, and we would send them back and they wouldn’t take them. Not me. They take them now. Now they say, “Thank you so much for sending them back. We were looking for this killer. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.”  But they all take them now. They take them very quickly before they used to say, “Don’t ever even think about landing that airplane. We don’t want those people.” So they take them back rapidly. Some day, they’ll tell the real story as to why, but that’s the way it has to be. We have thousands and thousands of killers and gang members that we’re bringing back to countries that now accept them. They were not taking them back. Last year alone, ICE officers arrested 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.  Now, some of them we keep here when they … It’s very egregious. We don’t necessarily trust other people to take care of justice, so we keep them here. But we don’t like having people in our prisons for 50 years, 60 years, and we have to pay for it. And so, for the most part, we bring them back to their countries and give them a very bad recommendation. State and local cooperation is the backbone of this effort. We have a tremendous relationship with-  It is the backbone of this effort. We have a tremendous relationship with many of the states and governments, cities. It’s essential that all of our states and cities honor ICE detainer requests to ensure that safe transfer of criminal aliens into federal custody takes place. Jurisdictions that adopt sanctuary policies and instead release these criminals, put all of Americans in harm’s way. A very, very serious problem. I mean we’re all here for the same thing. I know we have different policies, different feelings, different everything, but sanctuary cities are causing us a tremendous problem in this country. We have stone cold killers that they don’t want to hand over to us and then they escape into communities and they cause in some cases tremendous havoc.  Another vital element of federal and state cooperation is the relentless fight against opioids and the drug epidemic. We’ve had great progress. We’re down 1819 and 20% in some of the communities. First Lady’s been very much involved in that. Kellyanne has been very much involved in that. A lot of the people in this room, almost everybody in this room has been involved in it. And I want to thank you for that. We’re making progress. Very tough, all over the world. This is a problem all over the world. This is big problem here, but it’s a big problem almost everywhere.  For the first time in three decades, we’ve achieved a decline in drug overdose deaths, including as an example, Ohio. Mike is around here someplace. Mike. Mike, Mike, 23% in Ohio. 19% in Pennsylvania. 10% in Wisconsin, and we’re averaging probably about 16, 17%, so it’s been… it’s not enough, but we’re making a lot of progress and if we had more help in Congress, we could get it even lower.  My administration is truly grateful for the leadership, cooperation, partnership, and friendship of the governors in this room. No matter our party, we must work together and really do the job and I think that’s what’s happening. Our country is now receiving thousands and thousands of companies that are coming into the United States. Some had left and some had never been here before, but they all want to be where the action is. We lost 60,000 plants and factories over the year, 60,000. It’s hard to even conceive and we’ve got many of them back and many are coming back and they’re moving to a lot of your states. I know a lot of them are coming into Texas and Florida and a lot of different locations. South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania. It’s incredible what’s happening. Ohio is a big beneficiary.  Michigan is a tremendous beneficiary with the car companies, tremendous. Somebody was saying they’re so happy in Michigan. And I meet with a Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I say, “Shinzō you have to get more car companies here. We have a deficit with you. You have to get them in.” And they are. They’re sending a lot of companies. We hadn’t built a plant in years and years, in decades frankly. And now we have car plants being built all over the United States and we have expansions, a lot of expansions of existing plants. So it’s been really an incredible thing.  We’re doing incredible work and we’re the number one country in the world right now in terms of the economy. When I was running and long before I was running, I’d always heard that China, have great respect for President Xi and great respect for China frankly, but that China was going to be the number one economy in the world during 2019. Actually it was 2018, 2019, you all heard it, that we were going to go to number two. And I will tell you we had our battle and we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and other things and you saw the… it was just announced, the trade deficit was the lowest it’s been in years with China. Just happened two days ago. They just announced. But we are now so far ahead of China in terms of the size of our economy that if somebody is smart that’s at this position for times into the future, hopefully after five years, I won’t joke by saying 9, 13, 15 it drives them crazy. For the governors it drives them… even when I joke, it drives them crazy. So I won’t say that.  But if somebody smart is in this position, it’ll never happen, which I know over Texas, it’ll never happen. So we right now have… we’re so far ahead of them. They’re not catching us for a long time. If the wrong person stands here or sits in the White House, that beautiful chair in the White House, in the Oval Office, sure they’re going to catch you. They have 1.5 billion people. We have 350 million people, but we have a very special place and a very special country and nobody’s going to catch us if we have great leadership. And you have been great leaders for your states and we appreciate very much that you’re at the White House. Thank you very much.  So what we’re going to do is I thought maybe we could take a few questions if you want. We could leave the press there. The press would love that, I’m sure. Or we could have them leave and we could talk in a different fashion. You won’t have to show boat. So would anybody preference. We’ll leave them here for a little while and then we’ll go a different route perhaps. Any questions, please? Please. We’re doing a big infrastructure potential deal. We need, obviously, we need help from… we need the votes of Democrats. They’ve been so focused on something else and wasting a lot of people’s time. Although my poll numbers have been driven way the hell up, so that’s one way to do it I guess. But they have been so focused on the impeachment hoax that they haven’t had time to do anything else, but we’re ready to go with a big infrastructure bill, if they’re ready to approve it.  We’re also ready to lower drug prices very substantially. We did last year was the first time in 51 years that drug prices, prescription drug prices went down first time in 51 years. But to get them really down, we have to do exactly what we’re doing, where we have… we need the votes of the Democrats and they just didn’t have the time to do anything. So maybe they will now have the time, but we’re all ready to go on infrastructure, on reducing drug prices. Very substantial. We can reduce drug prices unbelievably easily and substantially, but we have to get Democrat votes. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Governor. Please. Europe has been treating us very badly. European Union was really formed so they could treat us badly, so they’ve done their job. That was one of the primary reasons, but they treat us badly there and they treat us badly frankly on NATO. But NATO I’ve gotten, as you know, $130 billion more they will pay because NATO was going down like a rocket ship. Our past leaders would go over and make a speech and leave. I went over, made a speech and said, “You got to pay more,” because the United States was paying everything. Essentially they were paying close to 100% and I let them know you have no choice and they are paying more. They paid 130 billion.  I think my biggest fan of the whole world is Secretary General Stoltenberg, head of NATO. He said he can’t believe it, because for 20 years it went down. It’s like a roller coaster there. No, no… none of this just down. They paid less and less and less and it got more expensive and more expensive with time. But I raised $130 billion my first meeting and I raised 400 billion my second meeting. So now it’s in good shape. But we were taken advantage of by a lot of countries, a lot of allies frankly. Sometimes allies do a better job on you than the enemy, because the enemies you watch out for, right?  So Pete, I think that the next thing could be Europe where we talk to them very seriously and they have to do it, because there’s been, over the last 10 12 years, there’s been a tremendous deficit with Europe. They have barriers that are incredible. I didn’t want to do them while we were doing China, Japan, South Korea. I didn’t want to do the whole world at one time. Does that make sense? People have learned that doesn’t work out too well, even on trade.  So we’re going to be starting that. They know that. They know that. They’re ready for it. We made a good deal with Japan. We’re going to do a bigger, much more comprehensive deal, but we’re taking in 40 billion from Japan, which they didn’t expect. Nobody expected. We’ve done great on the trade. It’s going to have a tremendous impact.  Now the virus that we’re talking about having to do… a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes in. Typically, that will go away at April. We’re in great shape though. We have 12 cases, 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now. So, but a very good question. Yes, please, Colorado. Well, we almost had a deal on that with the Democrats as you know. It was done. And then we lost a decision and the Democrats said, “Trump, who’s that? Trump, who’s that?” But we were very close to having a deal on the dreamers with the House and with the Senate, would have been very good deal for everybody. And so we’re looking at that.  But now we’re before the Supreme Court. I think we’re going to win, because if we don’t win, that gives the President of the United States unbelievable powers. President Obama signed that bill, it was an executive order. And when he signed that, he said essentially he said, “I don’t have the right to do this, but I’m going to do it anyway.” And he was upheld by a judge and anyway, it’ll be before the Supreme Court pretty soon and at some point I think we’ll probably make a deal on that. I do feel that way. Okay, good question. Question. Yes please. Gary. How’s Mitt Romney? You keep them. We don’t want him. Go ahead. Doing a great job in Utah by the way. Go ahead Gary. Yeah, I agree. We’re putting out a plan today that over a period of… not that long a period of time, brings our budget and our deficit down to what it should be, which is close to zero. And I think people are going to be very impressed by it. We’re not touching Medicare. We want to keep Medicare. We’re not touching social security. We’re making our country stronger again. We’re not decreasing Medicaid, but we’re doing a lot of things that are very good, including waste and fraud, tremendous waste and tremendous fraud. So what we’re doing that, in terms of certain programs. And we’re taking good care of our military, we’re increasing spending on our nuclear program, because we have no choice, because of what China is doing, what Russia is doing in particular. And so we have a very big number in for that. Now, at the same time, Russia and China both want to negotiate with us to stop this craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars nuclear weapon.  … This craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars on nuclear weapons, but the only way until we have that agreement, the only thing I can do is create by far the strongest nuclear force center in the world. Which as you know, over the last three years, we’ve very much upgraded our nuclear, but we’re buying new, we have the superfast missiles, tremendous number of the superfast. We call them superfast, where they’re four, five, six and even seven times faster than an ordinary missile. We need that because again, Russia has some, I won’t tell you how they got it. They got it supposedly from plans from the Obama Administration when we weren’t doing it. And that’s too bad. That’s not good. But that’s how it happened. And China, as you know, is doing it.  We have a tremendous $740 billion for military. But again, it’s also jobs in the United States. So it’s everything’s made in the United States proudly. And we have the best in the world. We have the best equipment in the world, the best missiles, planes, rockets. Everybody wants our equipment. We have to be very selective obviously, but we’re going to have a very good budget with a very powerful military budget because we have no choice about that. Ron, do you have something about, for instance, your plan of buying and cutting prescription drugs? You want to tell them what we’re doing? You can go, and Colorado is doing that, also, you can go to certain countries and the exact same pill made in the exact same plant, factory wherever it may be from one of the big companies, will sell for 50%, 60%, 70% less than the United States is paying because it’s broken. It’s a broken system. And so one of the things I’ve authorized is that certain states have requested probably after this, everybody in this room will go back, but, but if we buy from Canada, you’ll save 50% at this moment.  Now that may go up or everything may come down. One thing is going to happen or another, either the drug companies are going to raise it and not make it possible to buy. They’re going to raise it in Canada, meaning so you won’t be able to do it. Or everyone’s going to go down because they have a middleman in the middle of that are making a fortune. Nobody knows who these people are, but they’re getting rich because we had a broken system and it’s about time it gets fixed.  So a lot of shakeup is going to take place, but if we had Democrats helping us, we could solve this problem in one day, but they don’t want to vote. Again, they don’t have any time to vote. They don’t have any time to do anything other than what they do. So they seem to be freed up a lot now. They’re freed up a lot actually I hear. How about a couple of more and then we’ll let the press go and relax and take it easy. Please, Governor. Thank you. Yes. So as you know, it’s gone down. I met with President Xi on the trade deal. And I said, “You have to stop fentanyl coming into our country. You have to do me a favor and stop it. You have to get it stopped. It has to end because it’s a favor for our country and we’re losing thousands and thousands of people to fentanyl.” I mean, the size of a pinhead can kill a lot of people. It’s unbelievably bad and they send it direct and they sent it through Mexico and through the border and we would catch a lot of it, but even if a little bit got through, it’s a very deadly drug. And they have cut it way back and they’ve also criminalized… It wasn’t a criminal, they considered a corporate kind of a thing. It was a drug of a different nature and now they put it into their criminal statutes and criminal in China for drugs, by the way, means that’s serious. They’re getting a maximum penalty. And you know what the maximum penalty is in China for that and it goes very quickly.  It’s interesting, where you have Singapore, they have very little drug problem. We have China, they have very little drug problem. States with a very powerful death penalty on drug dealers don’t have a drug problem. I don’t know that our country is ready for that, but if you look throughout the world, the countries with a powerful death penalty, death penalty with a fair but quick trial, they have very little if any drug problem that includes China. But they’ve put fentanyl now into there, he’s working on that and it’s gone down a lot as you know. They put it into their penalty system and people will be getting the death penalty in China now for fentanyl. It was a big thing. It’s not part of the trade agreement, but it is part of the trade agreement. And they have acted on it.  Now, of course they’re working on something else and I think they’re doing a good job on that. On the virus. Had a long talk with President Xi for the people in this room two nights ago and he feels very confident. He feels very confident. And he feels that, again as I mentioned by April or during the month of April, the heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus. So that would be a good thing. But we’re in great shape in our country. We have 11 and the 11 are getting better. Okay, so great question. I think that fentanyl is a huge problem. It’s almost at this moment to 100% made in China and they are starting to enforce it on our behalf. We have a good relationship with China now. Probably the best we’ve ever had. So I think what we’ll do, any other questions from the governors? Yes please. So we did a big thing on healthcare. We got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which basically made Obamacare not Obamacare anymore. It was the most unpopular thing in Obamacare and basically you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not paying to have bad healthcare and nobody wanted that. And we got rid it, big, big move and I had a choice. I can make so it really isn’t Obamacare anymore but, we do as you know we left preexisting conditions and everything. We left it because preexisting we’ll always have, and I think I can speak for Democrats too, but we are all going to have preexisting conditions. We are always going to make sure that that’s taken care of, the preexisting condition situation.  I think I can speak, I know I can speak for Republicans. I think I can speak for Democrats. It’s a part of our society right down. Nobody’s going to change it. If a law is overturned, that’s okay because the new law is going to have it in the new law would replace the old law that was overturned it would have preexisting conditions. So I think that’s important to say. But one thing that we will be doing is, at least from a Republican standpoint, you have 180 million people out there that have great health insurance. They love it, private health insurance, and we’re going to save it.  Other people are thinking about terminating it, which is brutal for unions and others. So I don’t know how they’re going to get around that, but we’re going to be saving that. But when I took over, I had a choice. So we got rid of the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, almost got rid of Obamacare but essentially we did. But now I said, “Do we run it really well or do we run it really poorly? Do we make everybody unhappy and blame the Democrats or do we make people relatively happy with a bad law?” It’s a bad law, it’s bad policy, but do we make people relatively happy. And I chose, I felt I had an obligation to do the latter. So it’s been working out pretty well and it goes along and we’ve done block grants, we’ve done a lot of different things with different states and it’s tailor made for different states.  We are doing things for states. Some people want block grants, some people want something else. And we’re working with individual states and I think governors are really happy and really surprised that we’re doing that. I could have just a cold lined it and just said we’re not doing anything and everybody would be happy. Everybody would be complaining. But I think the best thing for our country to do is the way we’re doing it until we get a replacement for Obamacare, a full replacement that’s going to be great. And I would say this, if we change the House, if we get the House, the Republicans get the House back, we will have that.  Otherwise we’ll just have to negotiate with the Democrats. And I think at some point they’ll come around and start negotiating these things because they really are good. So media, thank you very much we appreciate it and we’ll have a little more discussion. Thank you very much."

"Thank you. Great gentleman. That’s first thing they said to me when I walked in, “But everybody knows who you are.” I know who you are. 11 years of this. That’s fantastic. What a tremendous story. Thank you very much. Congratulations because I’m going to give him an early congratulations, all right? That’s big stuff. That’s big stuff. So, thank you very much, Jon.  Two years I was honored to celebrate your story of faith and transformation as you stood with me in the Rose Garden of the White House. It was a great day, a beautiful day. Now, I’m thrilled to come to Las Vegas Police Department. Thank you very much for being what a group that is. That’s some job you guys do. Some job you do. Lot of friends, too, lot of friends, to take part in your organization’s HOPE for Prisoners graduation ceremony.  We are here to reaffirm that America is a nation that believes in redemption. That’s what it’s about, redemption. We believe in second chances and we want to bring returning citizens, great people, great people. In many cases, great people. And not in all cases. I’m not going to be too politically correct, fellows, right? Not in all cases. But in many cases, we want to rebuild their lives, they want to rebuild their lives. They want to help us and rebuild our country. And please, everybody, please sit down. It was a little bit late with that one, wasn’t it? Thank you. That feels better, doesn’t it, huh?  But to the 29 graduates who returning to your families, you have paid your debt to society and shown a commitment to change. You’ve overcome many challenges, broken free of addiction, learned new skills and replaced old habits with fresh resolve. And Jon told us just outside little while ago that it’s an incredible class. Incredible class of talent. That word talent is very important. And now you have a chance to begin a new chapter that you are proud to call your own. And I have little doubt you’re going to be very, very successful. Your future does not have to be defined by the mistakes of the past. Today, we declare that you are made by God for a great and noble purpose and you understand that. I mean, it’s a great and noble purpose on your valued members of our American family. And we are determined to help you succeed and we’re going to work with you and you’re going to work with Jon and everybody else in this really incredible place that you’ve all put together, Jon. And you’re going to be so successful. You’re going to say, “I’m going to be more successful than Trump.” I’m going to be more … and I’ll be happy if you do it. I’ll tell you what. I’ll be very happy about it. But as long as you work hard and follow the law and do your part, you contribute to your communities, your best days are just beginning. Best part of your life is beginning. I really believe that. And your greatest years are just ahead. And to all of the family members and loved ones who have been through so much of the graduates’ who joined us today, we know your journey has not been an easy one but your love and support make all of the difference. And we are tremendously grateful for the families, the loved ones. And I know they’re even more grateful because without them, you wouldn’t be here. You wouldn’t be here. So, I want to thank you.  And joining us for this ceremony are two leaders who have devoted so much to advancing medical cures to help people overcome the stranglehold of addiction. Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, and they’ve been great friends of mine for a long time. Stand up, Sheldon. What a family. What a family. And Miriam is a doctor. A great doctor. She doesn’t have to be a doctor. You can trust me. Her husband doesn’t need the money. But she devotes her life, it’s the most important thing to her, to addiction. And every time she learns something new, and there’s still plenty to learn, but she’ll call me and tell me what they’re learning about addiction and the job you do, Miriam, what you’ve done, Sheldon, just overall is incredible. Really good. Two great people. Just great people.  And they like a place called Israel very much. Would you say that’s correct? Maybe I have to use the word love a place called Israel, right? Your case.  Thank you as well to Las Vegas mayor, Carolyn Goodman, for being here. Carolyn, thank you very much. Great, great job. And also the tireless advocate because Carolyn has been very much involved with criminal justice reform along with Jared Kushner, who’s been very, very much involved. I don’t know. I think … I think, Jared, I’m starting … Where’s Jared? Thank you, Jared. Never wants any credit. He does a lot. He works hard. But that’s working out very well, isn’t it, Carolyn? And it’s working out well for everybody and tremendous support. And we had liberal support, we had conservative support and they came to me and they needed some help, and we got help from some very unexpected places. Votes, we needed votes. And we got some great people.  Republicans, in all cases in this case, but we got some great people to vote for criminal justice reform. So, in fact, very conservative republicans, so that was a good sign. Very bipartisan and it was a terrific thing, and we really, we did something that they been trying to do for a long time, and we got it done. We get a lot of things done. Get a lot of things done.  Now you see a lot of press back there, so before we go any further, I want to address today’s sentencing of a man, Roger Stone. Roger Stone, he’s become big part of the news over the last little while. And I’m following this very closely, and I want to see it play out to its fullest because Roger has a very good chance of exoneration in my opinion. I’ve known, and you people understand it probably better than anybody in the room, I’ve known Roger Stone and his wife, who’s really a terrific woman, for a long time. And Roger’s definitely a character. Everybody sort of knows Roger. Everybody knows him. And most people like him. Some people probably don’t. But I do, and I always have. He’s a smart guy. He’s a little different. But those are sometimes the most interesting. But he’s a good person. His family is fantastic. He’s got a fantastic family. And there’s always a reason for that, isn’t there?  Roger was never involved in the Trump campaign for president. He wasn’t involved. I think early on, long before I announced, he may have done a little consulting work or something, but he was not involved when I ran for president. And he’s a person who, again, he knows a lot of people having to do with politics. His whole life is politics. That’s what he is. And it’s my strong opinion that the forewoman of the jury, the woman who was in charge of the jury is totally tainted. When you take a look, how can you have a person like this? She was a anti-Trump activist. Can you imagine this? Now you wouldn’t know about a bad jury. Anybody here know about a bad … No?  These people know more about bad juries than everybody here including the sheriff and the mayor and everybody. They know about bad juries. We’re not going to say it too much, though. Let’s not say it in front of more cameras than this. But you’re my experts, okay? No, but this is a woman who was an anti-Trump person, totally. Now, I don’t know if this is a fact, but she had a horrible social media account. The things she said on the account were unbelievable. She didn’t reveal that when she was chosen. And she’s, I guess from what I hear, a very strong woman, a very dominant person, so she can get people to do whatever she wants. And she got on, then she became the foreperson, forewoman, on the jury.  And I assumed they asked her a question. ” Do you have any bias? Do you have any …” She didn’t say that. So, is that a defrauding of the court? You tell me. But does this undermine our fair system of justice? How can you have a person like this? Did she delete her social account? And when Roger was determined by this same jury to be guilty before the judge issued a sentence, and he was determined to be guilty, and she started going a little wild. She’s very happy. And she started saying things and people said, “That’s strange. That’s strange.” And then they started looking in … How can you have a jury pool tainted so badly? It’s not fair. It’s not fair.  And you know, it’s not happening to a lot of other people because you can look, I won’t name names, but everybody knows who I’m talking about. What’s happening over there? Nobody. Nobody. There are people that are, even in Roger Stone’s basic business of politics, that were going to be in big trouble, well-known people, the biggest people, big trouble. They were forced to leave their firm. One man was forced to leave his firm and he was going to … Bad things were going to happen to him the following day. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. He was the biggest. Nothing happened. But it happened to Roger Stone, and it happened to General Flynn, and it happened to … I won’t name names. It happened to a lot of people. And destroyed a lot of people’s lives. And I’m here to make a fair system.  Again, Roger is not somebody who worked on my campaign. I know Roger but a lot of people know Roger. Everybody sort of knows Roger. And what happened to him is unbelievable. They say he lied. But other people lie too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok, Peter Strzok, lied. You don’t know who these people are? Just trust me. They all lied. You had people that forged documents. You had people that wrote fake dossiers and brought them to the FBI and used people in the Justice Department to get them to the FBI. And these people know in the front row, you know better than anybody in this room what the hell I’m talking about probably. So, I’m only responding to you. I’m not even talking to the folks over here. But they get it better than anybody, too. Lot of bad things are happening. We’re cleaning it out. We’re cleaning the swamp. We’re draining the swamp. I just never knew how deep the swamp was. So, if this woman was tainted, I hope the judge will find that she was tainted. And if she isn’t tainted, that will be fine too. But I’m not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States. I want the process to play out. I think that’s the best thing to do because I’d love to see Roger exonerated, and I’d love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly. They talk about witness tampering. But the man that he was tampering didn’t seem to have much of a problem with it. In fact, they know each other for years.  And, it’s not like the tampering that I see on television when you watch a movie. That’s called tampering, with guns to people’s heads and lots of other things. So, we’re going to see what it is. Maybe there was tampering and maybe there wasn’t. But, I can tell you that it was tremendous lying, really lying and leaking classified documents, that you don’t know about. But they leaked classified documents. You know, there was a young sailor who took pictures of their old submarine and sent them to his mother and a friend and it destroyed his life. I let him out. They were considered classified. Now Russia and China, I guarantee you, have the pictures of the submarine for long time. The submarine was like 30 years old. They had them in the first year. They didn’t have to wait for the 30th year.  But this is a famous story. And they had these pictures, and they put him in jail. He sent them to his mother and to his friend. His friend was not interested in what you’re thinking, and there are many other cases where documents were leaked, even accidentally. It’s so … Classified documents are so important that even if they are leaked accidentally … Hell, Hillary Clinton leaked more classified documents than any human being, I believe, in the history of the United States of America, right? And she deleted 33,000 emails. And she said, “Oh …” And by the way, if you did it? Five years, maybe more, okay? But you’d never have access to classified. Very few people have access.  She deleted 33,000 emails. I kept waiting because you know, they can talk Benghazi, they can talk 100 different things. What people understand is when you get rid of this kind of evidence so the United States Congress said, they subpoenaed her. They wanted to see her emails. After getting the subpoena, she deleted 33,000 emails. And they said, “You remember this?” Yes, the emails were about her yoga classes, her exercising and her daughter’s wedding. 33,000 about her daughter’s wedding? That must have been the greatest wedding of all time. And nothing happened to her and yet they’ll put a young sailor in an old submarine with a picture, couple of pictures, they’ll put him into jail. And I pardoned him because it was unfair that she was able to do it at the highest level and his level wasn’t … what he did, it was confidential. Confidential’s a much lower class than classified.  So, I tell you this because it’s interesting. This is part of our nation. This is what’s going on now. So, I’m going to let this process play out. And, we want to have a great and fair court system and I hope you had a fair and wonderful court system, but perhaps you didn’t. Perhaps you didn’t. And if you didn’t, we want to straighten it out but we have to straighten it out also at the top level. So, we had a lot of dirty cops, FBI is phenomenal. I love the people in the FBI. But the people at the top were dirty cops. And if you would have read the report written about Comey, 78 pages of kill, with a reference of, “Go get him.” They really said it. “Go get him.” And then you read about McCabe, and you see what they said. So bad. And we’re just waiting. I’m not doing anything. I’m just sitting here, standing here, talking to you. We’re waiting.  So, I just want to let the fake news media know that … I just want to let them know, because there’s few people more dishonest than these people, I will tell you that. And you have some very good ones. Hell of a lot more dishonest than most of you in the audience were.  Hell of a lot more dishonest than most of you in the audience were. But I’m going to let the media know that I’m going to watch the process. I’m going to watch it very closely. And at some point I’ll make a determination. But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly. And this has not been a fair process. Okay? Thank you.  So when I ran for president, I pledged to fight for those who have been forgotten, neglected, overlooked, and ignored by politicians in our nation’s capitol, and you understand that very well. For decades, no one was more forgotten than citizens coming out of prison who were ready to go into a brand new, beautiful start, but couldn’t find a job. They couldn’t find people who believed in them.  And one of the great things that happened is I and my administration and a lot of very talented people that work with me, we created the strongest economy in the history of our country. We have the best unemployment numbers. We have the best unemployment numbers for African American, best in history. Asian American, best in history. Hispanic American, best in history. Our country is booming. We’d never done better. It’s the best economy we’ve ever had.  So when people come out, as an example yourselves, you’re going to get great jobs. I’ll tell you the end result, and we do studies on this. People with businesses are going to hire you. They want you more than you want them. This is the first time this has happened. Okay? This is the first time. They want you to do it and they wouldn’t have given you that second chance. We call it second chance, but they wouldn’t have given you that second, some cases a third chance. That’s okay. But they wouldn’t have given you that second chance. Now they’re doing it because they need people, because the economy is so good.  And I’ll tell you the end result. Employers are calling the numbers that we’re getting, the respect that you’re getting from people that are doing the hiring, they can’t even believe it. I had one gentleman, I talked to him, he had seven people came out of prison. He’s got seven people working for him. He said, “They’re among my best.” He said, “They are among my best people.” He said, “I cannot believe it.” And you know what? Some businesses don’t always work out. I’m not going to say everybody is perfect, because it’s not. Nobody’s… you take a group, there’s always going to be somebody who doesn’t work out. But he said, “I can’t believe it. They are…” he’s got seven now. They’ve been with him for quite a while. He said “They’re are among the best people I’ve ever employed.” He is so happy. It’s going to happen with you. It’s going to happen with them. What do you think? I think it’s going to happen with this group.  So once I came into office, leaders from all different backgrounds asked me to make changes to our criminal justice and the more I learned about the issue, big issue, the more I knew that criminal justice reform was really not about politics, because you have people that are for and against it on all different levels. Republican, Democrat, conservative, independent, liberal. Some love it, some don’t love it, but they’re starting to love it. We’re having tremendous success with it.  And it’s about doing the right thing, because Alice Johnson and I’ve really gotten to know her well and she’s an incredible person. And because of Alice, we’re taking in… we’ve just let out three other people that she knew. And I say to people, and you may have references and recommendations when you were wherever you may have been. Frankly, you know some people that were really good people who… Alice was in for 22 years. She had another 18 years to serve and for a crime, but not that kind of a crime. And I learned about Alice Johnson and when I learned it really is really something special. She’s an incredible woman. She came out of prison.  You’ve seen the whole thing. We actually did a commercial on it. I did the commercial for people to see what this is all about. She came out… you couldn’t hire an actor in Hollywood to have the emotion and the love and the tears and everything. She came out and she saw her family who had totally grown up without her, and some big strong young men, some wonderful women, just all family. And she was grabbing them and they were all hugging and kissing outside of this massive prison wall. And they were just screaming with joy. It was an incredible thing to see. You couldn’t do it. It had to be natural. It had to come from the heart. It had to come from the heart. So it was nice. And I said to Alice and I said to other people, and I’ll say to you, and I’ll say to you, you’re going to have some recommendations. You think I’m making a mistake with him? What do you think? Okay. You’re going to have some recommendations. I want your recommendations, because you have… we have thousands of people in prison that have stories like Alice Johnson, thousands and thousands of people. And I love doing it. I love doing it. And you can be poor, you can be middle-income, you can be rich. It’s injustice is injustice, but you have thousands of people that shouldn’t be there. And I love finding those people. As you find them as you really think… but you can’t let me down. They got to be right, because there are some people you don’t want to do this with. You do know that.  I said to Alice, “So Alice, let me ask you, you have a lot of people like yourself, right?” Yes. But you have bad people too, don’t you? Yes, we do. Some very bad people. I said, “Good, because I wouldn’t want somebody to say no, everybody’s good, because that’s not the case.” But she’s given us great recommendations and she’s a great woman.  To redress unfairness in the justice system, just over one year ago, I led the effort to pass the criminal justice reform, and others had tried and failed. They didn’t try too hard because they know it couldn’t be done. But we got it done. This law rolls back provisions of the really terrible 1994 Criminal Clinton Crime Law that disproportionately impacted the African American community. I mean they like Clinton, but they passed a law that was a disaster. You know that. But we did something about it. They were unable to do it all the way back. We did something about it.  And my recent budget provides over $400 million to expand vocational training, drug treatment, and critical reentry programs just like this one. Okay. You know that. He knows it. By enacting criminal justice reform, we’re sending a powerful message to prisoners who have reformed their lives. When you return to society, we are not going to leave you behind. We’re not leaving you behind. But now we don’t have the excuse of a bad economy. They used to have the excuse, well, we can’t do it, the economy’s no good. The unemployment rates were very high. We’re down to 3.5%. We’re probably going lower and wages are going up, first time in 21 years. They’re really going up and going up. It’s a beautiful thing. If you’re in my world, it’s a beautiful thing to watch. It’s like a picture. Everyone in this room is here to make sure that you have the support that you need to succeed, thrive, and to never ever look back. You’re not going to look back. We’re not going to look back.  And we’re joined today by many great pastors and faith leaders, some of whom I know pretty well, who trust the power of prayer and the mercy of God to transform their lives. And I want to thank you all for being here. Thank you. Great, great faith leaders. Thank you. Please stand up. Please stand up. Great. Thank you. Thank you, father. Great job. Actually been to a couple of their churches. Thank you very much.  Also with us or our employers of many different industries who are here to recruit you. Don’t ask for too much. Just take it nice and easy. Don’t forget they want to make a good deal, but you do too. But they want to recruit you for great jobs and they’re here. Who are the people that are looking? Who are the people, the employers please? Yeah, stand up please. That’s great. That’s good. That’s great. Great. You’re going to be happy. You’re going to be very happy.  Including the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, who really has done a fantastic job over the years. I’ve known how hard they work and what a great job they do. Station’s Casinos, Martin and Harris Construction, civil work, general contractor, Silver State Transportation, Keolis Transit and Workforce Connections. And I want to thank you all and we have a lot of others outside that are coming in too, and you’re going to have a lot of… you’re going to have a lot of fun. It’s nice to be loved, right? It’s nice to be wanted. You’re wanted. You’re wanted. Finally… you are. You’re wanted. Right John?  Finally, we’re proudly, really proud to be joined by more than 80 men and women, these people are so incredible, of law enforcement. The job they do. Sheriff, the job… please stand up. You don’t know how much people respect you. You don’t hear it. You don’t hear it. People respect you like you wouldn’t believe. So we just want to thank you all. The job you do is incredible, law enforcement. We honor your selfless service and bravery.  By the way, fire department also. I just left an area of the country where two firemen were just killed and a terrible. Up in certain portion of beautiful place in California where a building collapsed. Two people killed, two firemen killed, and we honor them. This took place yesterday, but they’re fantastic. But I want to thank law enforcement, because the job you do is incredible and the respect that people have for you, you’ll never know how strong it is. It’s strong and I think it’s stronger now than ever before. And now you have an administration that loves you, backs you. We give you the equipment that you need. We gave billions of dollars of equipment. We had surplus equipment, military equipment, incredible stuff sitting in hundreds of warehouses all over the United States. And for some reason other people didn’t want to give it out. But I gave it out and I assume you got some of it right? You got some of it. I know the man, he probably got most of it. Right? That’s good. It keeps you safe.  As you know, Hope for Prisoners has pioneered a mentorship program with law enforcement, which has given strength and support to former inmates like Lois Hockersmith and she joins us today. Lois. Where’s Lois? For many years, Lois struggled with addiction. In May of 2012, she found herself pregnant and in jail. After she served her time, Lois participated in Hope for Prisoners program. She graduated in 2013 and since then Lois has stayed totally sober. She’s earned back custody of her precious, beautiful son and she is one of the best case managers here at Hope for Prisoners. Is that right? That’s good, that’s great. Thank you. Wow. Come on up here, Lois. Come on up here. Through it all, Lois has been encouraged by her mentor who is the same officer who arrested her nearly eight years ago. Lieutenant Steve Riback, who also joins us today. Hey Steve, come on up. Is Steve here? Steve is here. Steve, come up.  Thank you. Hey, whoa, he’s good looking, huh? Come here. Thank you. Thank you. Well, we’re with you 100%. It’s good. Please. You like to say something?  Thank you. Take care of mom, right? He’s so beautiful. Would you like to say something? Please. He feels very comfortable. You did a good job. That was a good job. Wow. He did okay fellows, right? He did. He did a great job. Thank you both. Lois and Steve, you remind us really that, all of us, that anything’s possible, and Lois is among the roughly 100 Hope for Prisoners alumni here today, all of whom are doing incredibly well. Please stand. Please stand, all of the alumni. Wow, that’s great. That’s great. That’s great. Great. Congratulations. Thank you very much.  But they’re really a testament to the bright future that awaits you all. It’s a great time in our country in so many ways. Our military is strong. Our country is just strong. We’re stronger in, I would say, just about every way than we ever have been before. Militarily. You take a look at what we’re doing with the stock market. We’ve had 144 out of three years. I’ve been here just a little more than three years and in a little more than three years, John, we’ve had 144 stock market records. Now that’s good for everybody. It’s good for your 401ks and it’s good for jobs and it’s good for… those are the ones that I think about first, jobs, 401ks, that and people are making a lot of money and people are getting tremendous… you’ll be investing some of your money in this now. You’d be doing fantastically well and you’re going to have 401ks or something, the equivalent and you’re going to do fantastically well.  And as I say, sometimes in speeches, the best is yet to come. We have tremendous potential. We have done… we’ve just made some incredible trade deals that will soon start kicking in. It’s going to make it a different country economically, as good as it does, it’s going to be much better. We had horrible, horrible deals, or no deals at all, and now we have phenomenal deals. We made a massive deal with China than we did the USMCA, that’s Mexico, Canada. We did a $40 billion a year deal with Japan and we did a deal with South Korea, and we have other deals too, and I’m going to India next week and we’re talking about… they have 1.5 billion people and Prime Minister Modi is number two on Facebook. Number two, think of that. You know who number one is? Trump. Can you believe that? Number one, I just found out. The head of Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg came in three weeks ago. He said, “Congratulations.” I said, “On what?” He said, “You’re number one on Facebook.” I said, “That’s cool.” Number one on Twitter too. But that’s because… true.  But that’s because… And if I wasn’t, I could never say it because it would be breaking news that Trump told the fib. Now number one and I congratulated a Prime Minister Modi. I said, “But you know, you have 1.5 billion people. I have 350 million. You have an advantage.” But we’re going to India and we may make a tremendous deal there. Maybe we’ll slow it down, we’ll do it after the election. I think that could happen too. So we’ll see what happens but we’re only making deals if they’re good deals because we’re putting America first, whether people like it or not. We’re putting America first.  So to help you find housing, jobs and support, I established, as you know very well, the Council on Crime Prevention and Re-entry. They’ve done a fantastic job and here with us today, our new executive director, Tony Lowden.  Tony, would you just come up and say a few words please? Tony Lowden. Thank you, Tony.  He looks good. Thank you, Tony. Wow. Thank you Tony. Wow, that’s great. Respected guy.  For too long, citizens with a record were not even considered for jobs. You know that even if they were qualified, rehabilitated, totally and ready to go to work, they wanted to go to work but all of that is changing and we began a nationwide campaign to encourage businesses to expand Second Chance Hiring; call it Second Chance Hiring. When we say hire American, we mean all Americans, all Americans.  And our entire nation wins when citizens with a record have a chance to succeed, such a tremendous, it’s what’s happened over the last three years is incredible. People came out, they didn’t have a chance and now they’re not only having a chance, you’re going to see in a little while when these guys try and make a deal. I want a little bit more. Give me a little bit more.  Together, we’re rebuilding the most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society, John, ever to exist. We are becoming a very inclusive society, much more so than in the past and a lot of people haven’t figured that out yet but I think they will. I think people are going to figure it out pretty soon. We want every citizen to join America’s unparalleled success in every community to take part in America’s extraordinary rise.  Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years. Think of that, 51 years; half a century. And by the way, the 7 million jobs, they thought it might be 2 million if we’re lucky. You go back three years, they were saying 2 million. We did 7 million and it’s pretty amazing.  African-American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded but I think one of the things we’re most proud of in this incredible economy, we’ll call it Trump Economy, call it, we’ll call it the ponder economy, we’ll call it something, but whatever we call it, this economy has been great and the thing that might be the best of all is what we’ve done with criminal justice reform. I really think so.  Our jobs market is so strong that businesses are recruiting the former prisoners off the sidelines in, by the way, record numbers. Record numbers, never happened anywhere, even close to these numbers. We know that having a job gives you the best chance to work hard to earn the paycheck, care for your families, chase your dreams and succeed, through our pledge to America’s workers, spearheaded by a very famous young woman. Did you ever hear of Ivanka?  She said, “Daddy, I want to help with jobs.” I said, “Well, I’ll put you here, there.” “No, no. I want to help with jobs. I want to get people jobs. They have to be trained. They have to be…’ So she had a goal of 500,000 jobs. That’s a lot; half a million jobs. She just broke Jared. I guess, is Jared around? She just broke… She just broke Jared Kushner. She just broke the father of criminal justice reform. He really is. I mean, he works so hard and Ivanka just broke 15 million jobs. Mayor, that’s good, right? And this is where they train the people in the companies. The government can’t do this. Walmart took a million people. Think of it. These big companies take and they train them. It’s very complicated stuff with computerization and all the things you have to learn. That’s not for government.  15 million people taken by many of the biggest companies, but also midsize companies, even some smaller, but she broke 15 million people about two weeks ago and her goal was 500,000 people over a fairly long period of time; 15 million. But if you know Ivanka, you’re not at all surprised. Believe me, I wasn’t surprised. I was sort of saying, “So what else is new.”  To everyone returning citizen here today, I know that there are some in our society who want to tell you what you can’t do. They’re going to tell you what you can’t do. It’s one of the reasons I wanted to be here. I wanted to say what I had to say to John too, because I sort of had that in my mind for a long time. Actually, the first time I met him but they want to tell you what you can’t do. They want to tell you why you can’t succeed. No way you can succeed.  You don’t want to listen to them because you’re proving different. They want to say why you can’t make it in this country. Why you can’t make it in any country. They think you’re not going to make it period, but do not believe those voices for one second because I’m here today because I believe in what you can do.  You’re going to be incredible. You’re going to be incredible. You’re going to see it and it’s going to go quickly. Each of you is a citizen of the greatest country on earth. There is more opportunity, more equality and more potential in America today than in any society in the history of the world. It’s true.  This is the country where anyone can make a comeback. We made a comeback with our country. We call it the Great American Comeback. This is the Great American Comeback and you’re doing the same thing. This is a nation where anyone can rise and this is the time when anyone can reach for the American dream, that beautiful American dream. That’s what you’re doing and whenever you have any doubt, whenever the road gets tough and it will, you’ll have those days. I’ve had those days. I mean, I didn’t do anything wrong and they impeached to me a few weeks ago, right? They impeached. I said, “What happened? What did I do?”  You think that was fun? Mary, you think that’s great to be impeached? The good news, my numbers went through the roof. I mean, you explain this to me. Explain this to me.  But you’ll have those days, right? You’re going to have those days but you’re Americans and you’re great Americans and Americans meet challenges. You defy expectations. You never give up. You never lose faith in the redeeming power of Almighty God and from this day forward, I’m here. I’m the president. I don’t have to do this. I could be someplace else but I want it to be here and I had plenty of choices.  One thing, as president, the American tells you, we have plenty of choices, right? We are a lot of choices. I wanted to be here but I ask each of you to seize your unlimited future. If you do, you will make the most of your incredible new found freedom. You’re pioneers in a way because you’re at a point in the country when it’s just all come together. You will unlock your unique talents and skill and aspirations. You’ll join a great project of national renewal and together we will make our country stronger than ever before.  Thank you very much for being here. God bless you and God bless America.  Thank you. Thank you."
"Thank you very much, please. So we had a couple of really great days in India. Prime Minister Modi is a terrific man. He’s a terrific leader. And we have a lot of things going in terms of product being purchased by India. We just had a meeting. A lot of the press was there. I thought it was a great meeting with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. They come from India, they’re agreeing to invest billions and billions of dollars. You heard it for yourself. They’re going to be investing billions of dollars in our country. That was the purpose of the trip. Also, we’re all set for $3 billion worth of helicopters, the Apaches and various other types in addition to other equipment. They’re buying that, and they’re buying a lot. They’re going to be buying a lot, and they’re also going to be buying a lot of our energy, all forms of our energy, because they need energy.  And we have more than anybody. We’re number one in the world now in energy. So that’s going to be very exciting. But I thought it was a great two days, was a fantastic two days. I’m going to be not at all controversial, because I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer, one little answer, little answer. Like John will ask me one little simple question, and you’ll blow it out. And that will be the end of the trip. They won’t even talk about the trip. I’ll be very, very conservative in my answers if you don’t mind. But we did. We had a great time. We had great meetings and we’re going for a state dinner. And then after that we get back onto the plane and we go back home. It’s going to be about 19 hours, but we look forward to it, get in tomorrow.  But this is a tremendous country. It’s 1.4 billion, probably at least the most people. And it’s a tremendous market and they really like us. And I think they like us more now than they’ve ever liked us, frankly. We have a terrific, a really great relationship between the prime minister and myself. So we’re going to be doing a lot of things. I think it was really, really worth it. You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it. And the people that have it are in all cases, I have not heard anything other, maybe there’s something new because for two days I haven’t been seeing too much of that news, very much news because it’s been very all encompassing. We’ve accomplished a lot. We had a lot of meetings as you know. But the people are getting better, they’re all getting better.  We brought in some Americans from a ship, because it was really the right thing to do. And they’re in quarantine. And we think they’ll be in very good shape very, very soon. We discussed a lot of different elements. We actually discussed the coronavirus, and at this moment India doesn’t have much of a problem, they feel. It wasn’t expressed that they did, which is great. And I think that whole situation will start working out. A lot of talent, a lot of brain power is being put behind it. Two and a half billion dollars we’re putting in. I see that Chuck Schumer criticized that. He thought it should be more. And if I gave more, he’d say it should be less, automatic with these characters. They’re just not good for our country. If I gave more, he’d say it should be less.  But that’s what they do in the meantime. That’s all they can do. They’re not getting anything done. We have so many things we could get done. We could so easily do prescription drug. Last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down. But we could drive them down really well if we had the Democrat votes. We need some additional votes. We would really drive them down, as you know. So with that, I think what we’ll do is take some questions and we’ll go to a nice state dinner and then we go home. Yeah. John, go ahead. It’s very obvious. I always thought frankly that Justice Ginsburg should do it because she went, while during the campaign when I was running, I don’t know who she was for. Perhaps she was for Hillary Clinton, if you can believe it. But she said some things that were obviously very inappropriate. She later sort of apologized. I wouldn’t say it was an apology, but she sort of apologized. And then Justice Sotomayor said what she said yesterday, you know very well what she said yesterday. It was a big story. And I just don’t know how they can not recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump or Trump related.  The right thing to do is that now as a Supreme Court Justice there’s a different standard. But at the same time I think it’s a higher standard in a certain sense. So they’ll have to decide what to do. But her statement was so inappropriate when you’re a justice of the Supreme Court and it’s almost what she’s trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way, and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate. Such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice. You know what the statement was, John. No, I don’t think that was it. But I think what she did say is she’s trying to shame the way I look at it. She’s trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way. And that’s so inappropriate. So let’s see what happens. We have things, whether or not they recuse themselves both. Look, Justice Ginsburg during my campaign, I protested at the time, she apologized in a very minor form. And what Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was really highly inappropriate. And everybody agrees to that, virtually everybody I’ve seen. I’ve seen papers on it. People cannot believe that she said it. Yeah, please. Go ahead. You know what, I’m reading, and again, I’m over here for the last number of days. But they went to see Bernie and they told Bernie about something having to do with, they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was a strange thing that they went to Bernie. And now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers that it was highly exaggerated. And frankly I think it’s disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the intelligence committee, House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that… Schiff leaked it, in my opinion.  And he shouldn’t be leaking things like that. That’s a terrible thing to do. But basically they would like to see Bernie as probably winning. And looks like he’s winning and he’s got a head of steam. And they maybe don’t want him for obvious reasons, so they don’t want him. So they put out a thing that rushes back in him. This is what they do. I’ve gone through it for a long time, I get it. I get the game better than anybody. And that’s the way it is. Terrible thing to say. And they didn’t say it about me. I will say this, somebody leaked it in intelligence, but nobody ever told me that. We have Ambassador O’Brien in the audience someplace. And he can tell you that this was never discussed with us, so I think it’s terrible. They ought to stop the leaking from intelligence committee. And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening. Go ahead ma’am. I think India would like to see it happen. I spoke with Prime Minister Modi today and I think they would very much like to see it happen. And we’re pretty close, we’ll see what’s going on. We’ve got two days now under our belt without violence or I guess a minimum of violence. And we’ll see what happens, but people want to see it. It’s very interesting that one, is everybody’s happy about it. Even people that are normally against me 99.9% of the time, because we’ve been there for 19 years and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is. Because that’s all they can do, crying Chuck. But people are really happy to see that we’re trying very hard. It would bring it down to 8,600. And from there we’ll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.  But there’s been tremendous praise for the fact that we’re doing something. Other administrations have tried to do something, in particular, the previous administration for a long time. They were never able to get anything done. And we’re really serving not as a military force as we are a police force. And we’re not a police force. They have to police their own country. We’re not a police force. It’s like law enforcement and that’s the way it is. So we’d like to, I can tell you after 19 years, we’d like to bring our young people back home. That’s where they want to be, and we’ll always have intelligence there. We’ll have other things there, but for the most part, we would like to bring them back home.  We want to watch the area. The area is a hotbed of problems. And when we bring them home, we’ll let them know that if something happens, we will hit them so hard. And we could win that easily if I wanted to kill millions of people. I don’t want to kill millions of people, innocent people. We could win that very easily. We don’t have to act as a police force. We could act as a military force to win, not a military force to just take care of things in that very, very difficult part of the world. It’s a very difficult part, very dangerous part of the world. So let’s see what happens. So far, so good. So far, but I’m very impressed with the kind of kudos we’re getting. Yes, please. I don’t think anybody’s done more than I have. If you look, because I came in and if you check your maps and look at Iraq and Syria, it was all over. In fact, they had it painted a certain color. I won’t tell you what color, because it doesn’t matter. Somebody will say it was a Republican color, so I don’t want to get people confused. But it happened to be red. And it was basically trying to show where ISIS was in those areas, and it was out of control. And I gave the orders, and we have 100% of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They’re being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far they haven’t agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor.  We captured them, but I did that. We killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago and Soleimani is gone. He’s no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father, the king of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and missing legs and arms. I’ve seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed, I have to say the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible. What they’re able to do, incredible. But that’s what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon. Roadside bombs. It’s a coward’s bomb, and all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor. In addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. He was looking to do damage and he’s gone. And al-Qaeda last week, you saw what happened there.  So nobody has done more than what I’ve done. but at the same time, Russia should do it, Iran should do it, Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. We’re in a different part of the world. We’re doing it. Everybody says you’re the only ones that can do it. At some point these other countries, Iran should do it. Iran hates ISIS and they should do it. And we’ve done a great job. We’ve taken our soldiers essentially out of Syria except for little hotspots that we’ll do that develop. But we’ve taken the oil and the soldiers we have, they’re the ones guarding the oil. We have the oil. So that’s all we have there. If you look, we are down to a small force in Iraq. And we’re down to a small force very shortly. But right now even we have a small force in Afghanistan, and so we’re moving out and moving around. But the only soldiers we have in terms of Syria, the predominant number of soldiers are the ones guarding the oil. I agree. But you also have other countries that can do this. The United States is 8,000 miles away. And they’re all saying, could you do it? Yeah, we could do it. We’ve been doing it for a long time, but I’ve been doing it much better than anyone else has done it. What we’ve done in the last couple of years has been incredible. We have 100% of the caliphate. Remember we had 99% I’d say, good, we’re leaving. And I was hit with, people couldn’t believe it. They said do 100, so we did 100. I did 100 with some great generals that knew exactly what they were doing. They were unbelievable. We took 100% of the caliphate. And we have thousands of prisoners right now locked up. And these are ISIS fighters and killed thousands. Not that I want to do that, I don’t want to do that. But that’s what we had to do. And when I came in, ISIS was all over the place. It was totally out of control. Please, thank you. So we did talk about religious freedom and- We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom and very strongly, and he said that in India, they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom. And if you look back and look at what’s going on relative to other places especially, but they have really worked hard on religious freedom. I asked that question in front of a very large group of people today, and he talked about it. We talked about it for a long time, and I really believe that’s what he wants. As far as the individual attack, I heard about it, but I didn’t discuss that with him. That’s up to India. Yeah. Go ahead, please. I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I’m trying to figure that out. He was a person I didn’t like, never liked. I don’t know too much about the case, because as you know, I’ve been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven’t been able to really see too much of it, but I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit. Not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like. I will say the people that liked them were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats, and I guess my question is, will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats, and it’s too bad, but that’s the way it worked out. Yeah, Peter? Well, again, I don’t know the actual results. I haven’t seen too much, because I’ve been in India as you know. I think that from the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing. It was a great victory and sends a very strong message. A very, very strong message, Peter. Yeah, please. No, no. There’s a big difference, in case you don’t know, between Ebola and Coronavirus. Big, big difference. It’s like day and night, and I felt that we should bring them back. They’re Americans. We should bring them back. With Ebola, it’s very explosive. It’s very terrible. We’re making tremendous strides on Ebola with the things that we’re doing, as you know. People are living with- Let me answer the question. But there’s a tremendous, there’s a vast difference than , especially in around ’14. Was that ’14 or ’12? And at that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically… People would disintegrate, and we’re still working on Ebola. We’re doing the vaccines. Excuse me. Yeah, we’re doing a vaccine. We’re doing a lot of things having to do with Ebola. We’re not forgetting about Ebola. That’s a horrible thing. But we have that now very much under control, other than certain parts of the Congo where they are having war and we can’t get in, so we’re still working on that. But as far as what we’re doing with the new virus, I think that we’re doing a great job. I felt that, and the decision was made in Japan, let these Americans come back and we’ll see where they are, but they were immediately put into quarantine. There’s no problem with it whatsoever. They’re all in quarantine. And as you know, I approved two and a half billion dollars for just that purpose and also for working on getting a vaccine. The level of death with Ebola, at the time it was a virtual 100 percent. There’s a very good chance you’re not going to die. It’s very much the opposite. You’re talking about one or 2 percent, whereas in the other case, it was a virtual 100 percent. Now they have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine. Yeah, please go ahead. Go ahead, Peter. Oh, all right.  Thank you. Yeah, we’re talking about the H-1Bs, and look, the relationship we have, this is not from me. This is from almost everybody that saw it. They say the history of India, which has a long history and a brilliant history in so many different ways, there’s never been a reception given to somebody like was given, and I would like to say for the United States of America. But nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got. It was 125,000, I think, seats they had yesterday. They were full. You had thousands and thousands of people outside. Prime Minister Modi was telling me thousands of people outside. That’s not uncommon for me, to be honest with you, but when I look at 125,000 seats… And that was an incredible scene yesterday. In addition, all of those people lined up from the airport to the event. It was an incredible thing. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.  The ambassador just told me that he’s been in India for a long time. In fact, both ambassadors, their ambassador and the ambassador from India said in 40 years, he’s never seen anything like it, what took place yesterday and earlier than that. But yesterday, they’ve never seen anything like it, so it was a great compliment. It was a great compliment to our country. I’m the leader of the country, but it was a great compliment to our country. But Prime Minister Modi said today they’ve never, ever had any event like that. In fact, they said usually when somebody comes in, they have to look for people to fill up the areas. There was something very special. Look, it’s a massive country in terms of its population, and people just wanted to see. They wanted to pay their respect to the United States, and so I appreciate it. I was a recipient, in a sense, but I was just really representing the country. Yeah, Peter? Yeah? Go ahead. Yeah, I don’t think it’s a big problem. I don’t think it’s very many people. I think we had a whistleblower who was a fake, because if you look at the whistleblower as an example, if you look at his report and then you compare that to the transcripts, it bore no relationship. That was a very sad situation and a lot of time, a lot of time wasted. Although as you will admit, in fact you wrote very nicely, I appreciate it, the poll numbers have gone up very much, but that’s not appropriate to have to benefit by something like that. Then there was supposed to be a second whistleblower. As soon as I released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone. Nobody ever heard what happened to the second whistleblower. I’ll ask you. Where is he? Remember, the second was he or she.  The second whistleblower was going to happen. It was just a matter of moments. And then I released the real call, the transcripts, which are now 100 percent accurate, even according to Lieutenant Colonel Veneman. Now, we want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country, because that was a disgraceful situation. Please . Good. We talked a lot about Pakistan. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. Very good. We talked about it today at length actually, and Prime Minister Modi, and it’s no question it’s a problem, but it’s a problem they have. They’re working on it. India is, it’s a brave nation too. There’s no pull-back from India, and we just hope. And I said I’ll help. I’ll do whatever I have to do, if I can do that, because my relationship with both gentlemen is so good. But there has been difficulty in Pakistan, and we’re seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I would do.  They’re working on Kashmir. Kashmir has been a thorn in a lot of people’s sides for a long time, and there are two sides to every story, but they’ve been working on that very hard. We discussed it at great length, terrorism, and I think we have some very good ideas. He’s very, very struggling against terrorism. I’ll tell you, Prime Minister Modi, he’s a very religious man, as you know. He’s a very calm man, but he’s actually a very, very strong person. Very tough, actually, when I’ve seen him in action, and he’s got that foremost in his mind, terrorism. He’ll take care of it. Please. Go ahead. You. Right here. That’s fine. Right there. We talked about many things, many, many things. We talked about Iran, we talked about Iraq, we talked about… We were together for two days. I’m going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7:00. It starts at 7:00, I believe. And we talked about exactly all of the things that you’re talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders, and I said we have to stop that. We have to stop, at least as it pertains to the United States, and I think we’re understanding each other. With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent and $250 billion, but in the meantime, we’re working with China very much on the virus. We feel that’s something.  And I have to tell, I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he’s going to do well. Now you see it’s going to South Korea, just going to Italy, and it’s going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They’re all working very, very hard on it. The United States, because of an early decision I made, I made a decision… I believe it was the first time it’s ever been done. We closed the country to certain areas, as you know, and I was criticized for that decision. Now they’re saying it was a good decision.  I think it was a good decision, because we have very few people, and you can add to it a few people that we took in because they were Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in-between countries where people weren’t going to take them and they were Americans, but they’re fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. We did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country, these were wonderful people. It wasn’t their fault. But we’re really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we’ve had a very strict line on the people that we’re taking the areas from which we take, and I did it very early. It’s never done before, and I did it early. I think it was a good decision as it turned out. Yeah, please. Okay, first of all, I want no help from any country, and I haven’t been given help from any country. And if you see what CNN, your wonderful network said, I guess they apologized in a way for… Didn’t they apologize for the fact that they said certain things that weren’t true? Tell me, what was their apology yesterday? What did they say? Let me tell you about your record. Your record is so bad you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You have probably the worst record- You probably have the worst record in the history of broadcasting. As far as McGuire is concerned, he’s a terrific guy. But you know, on March 11th his time ended anyway, so his time came up. We would have had to, by statute, we would’ve had to change him anyways, so the time was . I think yes, yes. In fact, we’re talking to five different people right now. I think all people that you know, all people that you respect, and I’ll make a decision probably over the next week to two weeks. We have some very good people. But Joe McGuire is a very excellent guy. He’s a very good man, and his time was March 11th. I believe it was March 11th where he would have had to leave. But we are going- No, not at all. Not at all. He was pushed out because frankly… He wasn’t pushed out. He would’ve had to get out. On March 11th, he would’ve had to leave, but we’re going to be making a decision on DNI very shortly. Yeah, please. Go ahead, please. Yeah. Well, that’s not nice. Well, that’s not nice. Let her do it. I know, but you ripped the mic out of her hand. You can’t do that. Boy, that wasn’t very nice. He’s worse than you. Yeah. We know the problems. Sure. Yeah, sure, we know the problems. I know the problems. Previous administrations had no clue. They didn’t know the problems. I know the problems. We’re being charged large amounts of tariffs and you can’t do that. You can’t do that. They understand that that’s where I am and if they want to deal with us, and they will, they’re going to, just like China. Everybody said, “You’ll never make a deal with China.” I made a deal with China. It’s a great deal. They’re going to buy $250 billion worth of product and that’s only a piece of the deal. It’s a large piece. It’s probably 40 to 50%, but it’s an incredible deal.  In addition to that, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars worth of tariffs that we can now use for phase two, because they want to get rid of the 25%. We have the 25%, they want to get rid of it. Well, with India, India is, I think, the highest, again, I said it before, but the highest tariff. When you deal with India, Harley Davidson has to pay tremendous tariffs when they send motorcycles in here. When India sends motorcycles into the US, there’s virtually no tariff. For the most part, there is absolutely no tariff. I just said that’s unfair and we’re working it out. We’re working it out. Go ahead. I think we’ll win that one easily. We’re working on that, yeah. We’re working on that too. It’s just not a fair situation when one company is paying 100% in the case of numerous companies, not just Harley, but where they’re paying tremendous. Actually tariffs were raised not too long ago. We also did something. There was a form of rent control that was, if you put it in a different sense, it was given to India and we terminated it. We terminated it. No, we’re talking. We have great discussions. Look, I can’t lose this. I can’t lose it. You know what? I’ll never lose it. It’s too easy, because I want reciprocal. It has to be reciprocal. The money you’re talking about is major, but the United States has to be treated fairly. India understands that the relationship is outstanding, but India understands that we’ve had a tremendous deficit for many, many years with India, with everybody, with frankly so many different countries. We’ve had a massive, massive deficit, but a large deficit, $30 billion with India, it’s now down to $24 billion because of what we’ve been doing, but still that’s too high. We shouldn’t have a $24 billion deficit. With other countries, we have more than that. Japan, we’re doing now 40 billion is coming in. A lot of very good deals are being made and they’ll be kicking in toward the end of the year. I would say if the deal happens with India, it will be toward the end of the year. If it doesn’t happen, we’ll do something else that’ll be very satisfactory. It’ll be very good. Go ahead. Who else? . Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn’t say that. I didn’t say anything about that. I just said Kashmir, obviously, there’s a big problem between Pakistan and India. I think they’re going to work out their problem, but I will say they’ve been doing it for a long time. . I don’t want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India. Hopefully they’re going to make the right decision for the people. That’s really up to India. Yeah, go ahead, please, please. Go ahead. Well, first of all, I’d describe it as incredible because when I looked at the various things, like today when we went … You probably saw where we were. When you look at all of the things that we’ve seen today, when we look at yesterday, the Taj Mahal and other things, in addition to working in between and even during, where we worked very long and hard with representatives from India, most particularly with the Prime Minister, I just think it’s an incredible country. It’s got unbelievable energy. You see that when you come in from the plane. When you see from … I think I can say virtually from the plane to whatever venue we were going to, it was wall-to-wall people. They’ve never seen anything like it. Somebody said it was the greatest greeting ever given to any head of state from any country. Now, India has more people than any other country, a little bit more than China, a little bit, tiny. I think the diplomacy is a diplomacy of great friendship and respect. I think it’s going to all work out very well. I really do. I admire your country tremendously. I respect your Prime Minister tremendously. I think it’s really a diplomacy of friendship. I think it’s going to work out very well. Go ahead, please. Please, go ahead, right next to Steve. I haven’t really been given a full briefing on that. We’ll get a look at it. We will look at it. It’s something that I don’t like to see. I don’t think it’s fair because we give very good access. Maybe some people would say we give too good. I don’t believe in that. I think we give very good access, so I don’t think it’s fair, but we’ll have a decision made on that relatively soon. Thank you. Good question. Please, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Well, you’ll be seeing something on that in the not too distant future, yeah. There could be very serious sanctions. What’s happening in Venezuela is so sad. People are starving. Here’s a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago, and very wealthy 20 years ago, very, very wealthy, the wealthiest in all of Latin, South America, the wealthiest, and by far, not even a contest. When you look today, they don’t have water. They don’t have basic food. They have no medicine. It’s incredible what’s happened to Venezuela. No, we’re watching Venezuela very closely. We don’t like it. We don’t like it, not at all. You’re going to see in a little while. You’re asking a question right in the middle of us doing something. Go ahead, please. Well, we did discuss that. We discussed that and specifically Muslims, and we also discussed Christians. I had a very powerful answer from the Prime Minister. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time in front of a lot of people. I had a very, very powerful answer. As far as Muslims are concerned, as he told me, I guess they have 200 million Muslims in India. A fairly short while ago they had 14 million. He said that they were working very closely with the Muslim community. Well, again, . Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I won the travel ban, as you probably know. A lot of people said I lost it. No, I won the travel ban. We used the travel ban where we think there’s, not based on religion, but where we think there’s going to be trouble where we’re looking at certain countries. As you know, we added a few countries onto it, but we won the travel ban and we won it in the Supreme Court. The travel ban is not a thing against Muslims. It’s a thing against areas where we don’t want people coming into our country that are going to cause problems, cause harm, cause death, hurt our people. I feel very strongly about that. Okay, please go ahead. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I think that India is going to be a tremendous player over the next … It’s now, but over the next period of 50 years or 100 years, look, you’re talking about the largest population in the world. You’re talking about a tremendous country in terms of its heritage, its potential wealth, frankly. Right now they have incredible potential. Economically, they have great potential. Their schooling system is getting better all the time. They’re doing a fantastic job in certain sectors with respect to education. We see it. In the United States, we see it. We have a lot of Indian students coming to our schools. They’re great students. They’ve done fantastically well in our schools, but we have thousands and thousands of people coming from India coming to our colleges in particular schools, but our colleges in particular. Now, India has got a phenomenal future. I mean, you can rarely think of a place that has a better future than India, and highly respected, especially with leadership like Prime Minister Modi. Yeah. Go ahead, pick one. Go ahead. I’m very satisfied because they’re investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He’s the largest steel person in the world by far. I don’t think there’s even a contest. He’s going to be building a billion dollar plant in Alabama. We had the press, I left them in there, always a risky thing to do, but if you see the … Let’s say we have answered 15 questions. They were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now in terms of their investment. They have done a  … some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I’m not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they’ve done is incredible, but Mr. Patel, who’s I think the biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual, but I think he’s the biggest steel company by a lot, he’s investing billions of dollars in the United States. He’s only doing it because of what I’ve done to bring back the steel industry.  The steel industry was dead, absolutely dead in the United States, and now it’s a vibrant industry. It’s incredible. We need it. Again, we need it for defense. It’s not just like certain industries that you don’t need. We need it for defense, but he was glowing. One of the reasons he’s spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back. We’re very proud of that.  I think what we’ll do is we’re going to see some of you on the plane on the way back. It’s been an honor to be here. It’s an incredible place with incredible leadership and an unbelievable future. I just want to thank you all. I’ll see you back in the States. I think some of you are on the plane and we’ll talk a little bit on the plane too. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. Before I begin, I’d like to extend my deepest condolences to the victims and families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Earlier today, a wicked murderer opened fire at a Molson-Coors Brewing Company plant, taking the lives of five people. A number of people were wounded, some badly wounded. Our hearts break for them and their loved ones. We send our condolences, we’ll be with them and it’s a terrible thing. Terrible thing. So our hearts go out to the people of Wisconsin and to the families. Thank you very much. I’ve just received another briefing from a great group of talented people on the virus that is going around to various parts of the world. We have, through some very good early decisions, decisions that were actually ridiculed at the beginning, we closed up our borders to flights coming in from certain areas. Areas that were hit by the coronavirus and hit pretty hard, and we did it very early.  A lot of people thought we shouldn’t have done it that early and we did, and it turned out to be a very good thing. And the number one priority, from our standpoint, is the health and safety of the American people, and that’s the way I viewed it when I made that decision. Because of all we’ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low. We had the greatest experts, really, in the world right here. The people that are called upon by other countries when things like this happen. We’re ready to adapt and we’re ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads. As most of you know, the level that we’ve had in our country is very low, and those people are getting better, or we think that in almost all cases the better they are getting.  We have a total of 15. We took in some from Japan, you heard about that, because they’re American citizens and they’re in quarantine, and they’re getting better, too. But we felt we had an obligation to do that. It could have been as many as 42, and we found that it was just an obligation we felt that we had. We could have left them and that would have been very bad. Very bad, I think. American people, and they’re recovering. Of the 15 people, the original 15 as I call them, eight of them have returned to their homes to stay in their homes until fully recovered, one is in the hospital, and five have fully recovered, and one is, we think, in pretty good shape and is between hospital and going home. But we have a total of 15 people and they’re in a process of recovering with some already having fully recovered. We started out by looking at certain things that we’ve been working with the Hill very, very carefully, very strongly, and I think we have very good bipartisan spirit for money. We were asking for 2.5 Billion, and we think that’s a lot, but the Democrats and I guess Senator Schumer wants us to have much more than that. And normally in life, I’d say, “We’ll take it, we’ll take it.” If they want to give more, we’ll do more. We’re going to spend whatever’s appropriate. Hopefully, we’re not going to have to spend so much, because we really think we’ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum. And again, we’ve had tremendous success, tremendous success beyond what people would have thought. Now at the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries, Italy and various countries are having some difficulty.  China you know about. Where it started. I spoke with President Xi, we had a great talk. He’s working very hard, I have to say. He’s working very, very hard, and if you can count on the reports coming out of China, that spread has gone down quite a bit. The infection seems to have gone down over the last two days, as opposed to getting larger, it’s actually gotten smaller and one instance where we think we can be somewhat reliable. It seems to have gotten quite a bit smaller. With respect to the money that’s being negotiated, they can do whatever they want. I mean, again, we’ll do the two and a half. We’re requesting two and a half. Some Republicans would like us to get four, and some Democrats would like us to get eight and a half and we’ll be satisfied whatever it is.  We’re bringing in a specialist, a very highly regarded specialist tomorrow, who works actually at the State Department. Very, very tremendously talented in doing this. I want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it, that I spoke with Dr. Foushee on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it. The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me. And so far, if you look at what we have, with the 15 people and they’re recovering, one is pretty sick, but hopefully will recover. But the others are in great shape. But think of that 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we’ve lost 360,000, these are people that have died from the flu, from what we call the flu. “Hey, did you get your flu shot?” And that’s something. Now what we’ve done is, we’ve stopped non-US citizens from coming into America from China. That was done very early on.  We’re screening people, and we have been, at a very high level, screening people coming into the country from infected areas. We have in quarantine, those infected and those at risk. We have a lot of great quarantine facilities. We’re rapidly developing a vaccine and they can speak to you, the professionals can speak to you about that. The vaccine is coming along well, and then speaking to the doctors, we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly, a vaccine for the future, and coordinate with the support of our partners. We have great relationships with all of the countries that we’re talking about, some fairly large number of countries. Some it’s one person. And many countries have no problem whatsoever, and we’ll see what happens. But we’re very, very ready for this, for anything. Whether it’s going to be a breakout of larger proportions, or whether or not we’re at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way.  So we’re at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list so that we’re going to be pretty soon at only five people, and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck. Johns Hopkins, I guess, it is a highly respected, great place. They did a study, comprehensive, “The Countries Best and Worst Prepared for an Epidemic” and the United States, we’re rated number one. We’re rated number one for being prepared. This is a list of different countries. I don’t want to get in your way, especially since you do such a good job.  This is a list of the different countries. United States is rated number one. Most prepared. United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Finland, this is a list of the best rated countries in the world by Johns Hopkins. We’re doing something else that’s important to me, because he’s been terrific in many ways, but he’s also very good on health care and we really followed him very closely. A lot of states do. When Mike was governor, Mike Pence, of Indiana, they’ve established great healthcare, they have a great system there. A system that a lot of the other states have really looked to and changed their systems, they wanted to base it on the Indiana system, it’s very good. He’s really very expert at the field, and what I’ve done is, I’m going to be announcing, exactly right now, that I’m going to be putting our Vice President, Mike Pence, in charge and Mike will be working with the professionals and doctors and everybody else that’s working. The team is brilliant. I spent a lot of time with the team over the last couple of weeks, but they’re totally brilliant and we’re doing really well, and Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me. But he’s got a certain talent for this and I’m going to ask Mike Pence to say a few words please. Thank you. Mike?  please. Okay, thank you . Great country, a long journey . We won’t talk too much about that other than I just got back, a long flight. It’s a long flight. He’s a great gentleman, a great leader. It’s an incredible country. We were treated very, very well, and we really enjoyed it. A lot of tremendous progress was made in terms of relationship. Our relationship with India is extraordinary right now, and we’re going to be doing a lot of business with India. They’re sending billions and billions of dollars now to the United States, but we’d rather talk about this right now. Well, I don’t think it’s inevitable. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we’re totally prepared. We have the best people in the world. You see that from the study we have the best prepared people, the best people in the world. Congress is willing to give us much more than we’re even asking for. That’s nice for a change, but we are totally ready, willing and able. It’s a term that we use, it’s ready, willing, and able. It’s going to be very well under control. Now. It may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We’ll see what happens, but regardless of what happens, we’re totally prepared, please. Well, just to understand, I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the president of other countries. Other countries on the list that are very respected in what they do in terms of what we’re talking about, but I really want to be responsible for this country. If it means placing a very strong situation on the border so people can’t come into our country from a country that is infected, we’re doing that and we’ve already done it with numerous countries, but we have to focus on this country. I don’t think it’s right to impose ourselves on others.  But, if others aren’t taking care, or we think they’re doing it incorrectly, we’re dealing with world health, and we have terrific people, and CDC does go around, and help other countries, give them recommendations as what to do, but they’re working on their countries, and we’re working on our countries, and so far from our simple end it’s really worked out very well. At a right time we may do that. Right now it’s not the right time, but at the right time, and we are checking people as they come through specifically for the problem that we’re dealing with. We’re checking a lot of people, if they’re coming from South Korea, it’s been hit pretty hard. Italy’s been hit pretty hard. China is obvious what’s happened in China, but again, the numbers seem to be leveling often going down in China, which is very good news, so we’ll see what happens. Well, Mike is not… Azar is vice president. He’s in the administration, but I’m having everybody report to Mike. Mike’s been very good, very adept. Anybody that knows anything about health care, they look at the Indiana model, and it’s been a very great success. It’s been a tremendous model in terms of healthcare, and this is really an offshoot of that, so this isn’t Azar. I don’t view Mike as a Azar. Mike is part of the administration, but I’m having them report to Mike. Mike will report to me. They’ll also be reporting in some cases to both.  I’ll be going to meetings quite a bit depending on what they want to do, and what message we want to get out, but we’ve done really an extraordinary job. When you’re looking at a country this size with so many people pouring in with the number one in the world for people coming into a country by far, and we have a total of 15 cases, many of which almost much within a day, I will tell you most of whom were fully recovered. I think that’s really a pretty impressive mark. Now, we did take in 40 people that were Americans, and they’re also recovering, but we brought them in, so I have a different group, but we felt we had an obligation to American citizens outside of the country that were trying to get back in. We thought it was very important. Well, I really think the stock market, if something I know a lot about, I think it took a hit maybe for two reasons. I think they look at the people that you watch debating last night, and they say if there’s even a possibility that can happen. I think it really takes a hit because of that, and it certainly took a hit because of this, and I understand that also because of supply chains and various other things, and people coming in, but I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong, the consumer is the strongest it’s ever been.  Our consumers are incredible, they’re incredible, that’s why we’re doing well and even before the virus, we’re doing great. Other countries have not been doing great. Our consumer’s very, very strong, very powerful economically. Yeah. Please. We do have plans of on much larger scale should we need that. We’re working with states, we’re working with virtually every state, and we do have plans on a larger scale if we need it. We don’t think we’re going to need it, but you always have to be prepared, and again, Congress is talking to us about funding and we’re getting far more than what we asked for, and I guess the best thing to do is take it, we’ll take it. Well, we’re going see if we’ll take care of states because states are working very hard. We have hospitals in the states that make rooms available, and they are building quarantined areas. Areas where you can keep people safely. We’re working really well with states. It’s a very big part of it. My attitude if Congress wants to give us the money so easy, it wasn’t very easy for the wall, but we got that one done. If they want to give us the money, we’ll take the money. We’ll just do a good job with it. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Well, we can get a lot of it. In fact, we’ve ordered a lot of it just in case we need it. We may not need it. You understand that, but in case we’re looking at worst case scenario, we’re going to be set very quickly, but I don’t think we’re going to ever be anywhere near that. I really don’t believe that we’re going to be anywhere near that. Our borders are very controlled. Our flights in from certain areas that we’re talking about are very controlled. I don’t think we’ll ever be anywhere near that. Please go ahead. Well, hopefully they’re going to be able to do that. We hope that it’s going to be in good shape by that time, but they’re going to have to remain a little bit flexible. Yeah, I would say travel related companies certainly right now they would be hurt. At the same time this ends, this is going to end. Hopefully, it’ll be sooner rather than later, and I think the business that they lost will be picked up at a later date, but right now I think they’re probably not going to be going to China. They’re not going to be going to certain countries where the problem is far greater than it is in the United States.  What it’s going to do is keep people home, and they’re going to travel to places that we have. It’s the greatest tourism country in the world, so instead of leaving our country, leaving our shores, they’ll stay here, and again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done. Sure, I think speaker Pelosi’s incompetent. She lost the Congress once, I think she’s going to lose it again. She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought that I would see that so quickly, and so easily. I’m leading everybody. We’re doing great. I don’t want to do it that way. It’s almost unfair if you think about it, but I think she’s incompetent, and I think she’s not thinking about the country, and instead of making a statement like that where I’ve been beating her routinely at everything, instead of making a statement like that, she should be saying, “We have to work together because we have a big problem potentially.”  And, maybe it’s going to be a very little problem. I hope that it’s going to be a very little problem, but we have to work together instead, she wants to do that. Same thing with Chuck Schumer. He goes out and he says, “The president only asked for two and a half billion dollars. He should have eight and a half …” This is the first time I’ve ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it’s we have to take less, and we should be working together. He shouldn’t be making statements like that, because it’s so bad for the country, and Nancy Pelosi, she should go back to her district, and clean it up because it’s the number one… If you look at percentage down, that was one of the finest in the world, and now you look at what’s happening.  I’m just saying we should all be working together. She’s trying to create a panic, and there’s no reason to panic, because we have done so good. These professionals behind me, and over here, and over there, and back here, and in some conference rooms. I just left a group of 45 people that are the most talented people in the world. Parts of the world are asking us in a very nice way, can they partake, and help them, so Nancy Pelosi shouldn’t… And, she knows it’s not true. All they’re trying to do is get a political advantage. This isn’t about political advantage. We’re all trying to do the right thing. They shouldn’t be saying, “This is terrible. President Trump isn’t asking for enough money.”  How stupid a thing to say. If they want to give us more money, that’s okay. We’ll take more money. Some Republicans think we should have more money too. That’s okay. We’ll take more money, but they shouldn’t demean the people that are on the stage who are the finest in the world. They’re not demeaning me. They’re demeaning the greatest healthcare professionals in the world and people that do exactly what we’re talking about. Well, when they get their opinion totally wrong as the New York Times did, and frankly, they’ve got a lot wrong over the last number of years, so let That work its way through the courts. If you read it you’ll see it’s beyond an opinion. That’s not an opinion, but something much more than an opinion. They did a bad thing, and there’ll be more coming I hope so, because Shinzo, obvious, a very good friend of mine, I love the people of Japan, and I hope it’s going to be in good shape. As you know, you have a number of people in Japan who have been infected. I hear they’re doing a very professional job, which doesn’t surprise me at all with Shinzo and with all of the people you have. I know Japan very well. I think they’re going to handle it very well. It’s a little tight. They spent billions of dollars building one of the most beautiful venues I’ve ever seen, and your prime minister is very proud of it. I hope it’s going to be fine. We hope it will. I would think so, yes. I haven’t spoken specifically about that with the various doctors, but I would think so, yes. I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down not up, but yeah, I think school should be preparing, and get ready just in case. The words are just in case. We don’t think we’re going to be there, we don’t think we’re going to be anywhere close, and again, if you look at some countries, they are coming down, it’s starting to go in the other direction.  This will end, this will end. You look at flu season, I said 26,000 people. I’d never heard of a number like that. 26,000 people going up to 69,000 people doctor you told me before. 69,000 people die every year, from 26 to 69, every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It’s incredible. So far the results of all of this that everybody’s reading about, and part of the thing is you, you want to keep it the way it is. You don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked about, but…  I don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked about. But when I mentioned the flu, actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, “Is this just like flu?” Because people die from the flu, and this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways, it’s easier. And in some ways, it’s a little bit tougher. But we have it so well under control. We really have done a very good job. Go ahead. I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves and they say, “If we ever have a president like this,” and there’s always a possibility, it’s an election, who knows what happens, right? I think we’re going to win. I think we are going to win by a lot. But when they look at the statements made by the people standing behind those podiums, I think that has a huge effect, yeah. I think it did. I think it did, but I think you can add quite a bit of selloff to what they’re seeing because they’re seeing the potential. Again, I think we’re going to win. I feel very confident of it. We’ve done everything and much more than I said we were going to do. You look at what we’ve done, what we’ve done is incredible with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military, taking care of our vets and getting them choice and accountability.  All of the things we’ve done, protecting our second amendment. I mean they view that second amendment, they’re going to destroy the second amendment. When people look at that, they say, “This is not good.” So you add that in. I really believe that’s a factor. But no, this is what we’re talking about is the virus. That’s what we’re talking about. I do believe in terms of CNBC and in terms of Fox Business, I do believe that that’s a factor. Yeah. And I think after I win the election, I think the stock market’s going to boom like it’s never boomed before. Just like it did by the way after I won the last election. The stock market the day after went up like a rocket ship. When we’re at a point where we don’t have a problem. We’re not going to loosen the travel restrictions, that’s what saved us. Mike alluded to it, had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area, we wouldn’t be talking this way. We’d be talking about many more people would have been infected. I took a lot of heat. Some people call me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one. We have to all work together. We can’t say bad things. And especially when we have the best team anywhere in the world and we really gave it an early start. We gave it a very early start. No, because we can get money and we can increase staff. We know all the people, we know all the good people. There’s a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven’t been used for many, many years. If we ever need them, we can get them very quickly. And rather than spending the money, and I’m a business person, I don’t like having thousands of people around when you don’t need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we’re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this great government that we have, and very specifically for this. We can build up very, very quickly and we’ve already done that. I mean we really have built up, we have a great staff and using Mike, I’m doing that because he’s in the administration and he’s very good at doing what he does and doing as it relates to this. Yeah, go ahead. I picked him, but your fine. Go ahead. Well, we’re testing everybody that we need to test and we’re finding very little problem, very little problem. Now you treat this like a flu. In fact, I might ask one of the doctors to come up and explain it. You want to wash your hands a lot. If you’re not feeling well, if you feel you have a flu, stay inside, quarantine yourself, don’t go outside. But there are certain steps that you can take that we won’t even be necessary. In many cases when you catch this, it’s very light, you don’t even know there’s a problem. Sometimes they just get the sniffle. Sometimes they just get something where they’re not feeling quite right. And sometimes they feel really bad, but that’s a little bit like the flu. It’s a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for and we’ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner. Yeah, go ahead. No. We’re going to have tremendously low unemployment. We’re setting records in that. In fact the administration is as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. And our numbers are very low, very good, 3.5 3.6. But you can’t really see what this does in terms of GDP. It could affect it, but that’s irrelevant compared to what we’re talking about. We want to make sure it’s safe. Safety number one, but this would have an impact on GDP. But we’re still a very, very… We’re doing great, but this will… I’ll tell you what has a big impact. Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago all of a sudden that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point even. It’s a massive company, I think Boeing, we had the general motors strike. That was a big impact on GDP.  And of course we’re paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the fed. I’m not happy with what that is because he’s kept interest rates. President Obama didn’t have near the numbers and yet if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We’re paying interest. Now, it’s more conservative and frankly people that put their money away and now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything. But I think we’re the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates, meaning they’re literally getting paid when they put out money. They borrow money and they get paid when it gets paid back. Whoever heard of this before? It’s said first. But we don’t do that. So I totally disagree with our fed.  I think our fed has made a terrible mistake. And it would’ve made a big difference as good as we’ve done, even without the 2000 points, and we started off at 16,000 and we’ll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody’s seen before, but we’re doing well, but we have to watch… We’re doing well anyway in other words, even despite the 2000 points, it sounds like a lot and it’s a lot, but it’s very little compared to what we’ve gone up. But we’ll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by general motors. We’ve been hurt by Boeing and we’ve been hurt, in my opinion, very badly by our own federal reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That’s something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country. You don’t mean my supporters, you mean my people that are not supporters. I agree with it. And I’d like it to stop. I think people know that when Chuck Schumer gets upset… He did the same thing with a couple of trade deals that are phenomenal deals now. Everybody’s acknowledged they’re phenomenal deals before he ever saw the deal. He didn’t even know we were going to make a deal. They said, “What do you think of the deal with China?” “I don’t like it. I don’t like it.” He talked about tariffs. I left the tariffs on 25% on $250 billion. He said, “He took the tariffs off.” He didn’t even know the deal and he was out there knocking it because that’s a natural thing to say. But when you’re talking about especially something like this, we have to be on the same team. This is too important. We have to be on the same team. No, I don’t think the CDC is. No, they’ve been working really well together.  They really are. They’re professional, I think they’re beyond that. They want this to go away. They want to do it with as little disruption and they don’t want to lose life. I see the way they’re working. These people behind me and others that are in the other room, they’re incredible people. No, I don’t see that at all. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. I don’t know who said that, but I appreciate it. No, I think you have to always… I do it a lot anyway, as you probably heard, wash your hands, stay clean. You don’t have to necessarily grab every handrail unless you have to. You do certain things that you do when you have the flu. View this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes, I try and bail out as much as possible when they’re sneezing. I had a man come up to me a week ago. I hadn’t seen him in a long time and I said, “How are you doing?” He said, “Fine, fine.” He hugs me. I said, are you well? He says, “No.” He said, “I have the worst fever and the worst flu,” and he’s hugging and kissing me. So I said, “Excuse me.” I went and I started washing my hands. So you have to do that. I really think, doctor, you want to treat this like you treat the flu, right? And it’s going to be fine. It was so nice of you to say thank you very much. Go ahead. Give me a nice question then. Don’t ruin it. Don’t ruin it with a bad question. Go ahead. They listened to a lot of what I had to say. Well, because this is a much different problem than Ebola. Ebola, you disintegrated, especially at the beginning. They’ve made a lot of progress now on Ebola. But with Ebola we were talking about it before, you disintegrated. You got Ebola, that was it. This one is different, much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu and this is a much different situation than Ebola. And we’re working on a right now by the way, we’re working on certain areas of the Congo. The Congo has Ebola and caused largely by the fact that they have war and people can’t get there. We can now treat Ebola. At that time it was infectious and you couldn’t treat it. Nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had ever heard of anything like this, so a much different situation. Yeah, go ahead. They’ve said it could be worse, and I’ve said it could be worse too.  No, I don’t think it’s inevitable. I don’t think it’s inevitable. I think that we’re doing a really good job in terms of maintaining borders in terms of letting people in, in terms of checking people, and also, that’s one of the reasons I’m here today, getting the word out so people can… They’ll know. They’re going to know. No, I don’t think it’s inevitable. I think that there’s a chance that it could get worse. There’s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse, but nothing’s inevitable. That’s right, Brazil. Yes, we’re very strong on people coming in from Brazil. Now it only has one case, it’s a big country, but it only has one case, but still it’s a case. We deal with Brazil very well. The president’s a very good friend of mine. In fact, he ran on exactly, it’s called “Make Brazil Great Again,” that’s what he ran on. We get along very well. I know you’re so thrilled to hear that. We get along very, very well. And we’re working with Brazil, but we have much worse instances than Brazil. You have Italy and you have other countries where they have much more than one person.  They have one person right now, as of now, as of just a little while ago, one person in Brazil. But Italy is a deeper problem, and we’re checking people coming in very, very strongly from those. And at some point we may cut that off. At some point depending on what happens, we may cut certain additional countries off like we’ve had to do with China. And we hope we can open it up to China as soon as possible, and we hope the numbers that we’ve been getting are true on China where it really has leveled off and started to go down because eventually sometime that’s going to happen. Go ahead. I think Secretary Azar is doing a fantastic job, but he also has many other things. We’re working on many, many things together. If you look at his schedule of what he’s doing, including drug prices, I think it’s perhaps the most complicated job that we have in government, and I want him to be able to focus on that. And Mike is really good at it. They’re going to work together, they’re going to work very closely together, and they’re both in the administration. I see them all the time, so it really works. This isn’t Azar, this isn’t going out and getting somebody that’s never been in the administration. I have two people that are very talented and it’s something I feel good about. I don’t want to spare the horses. I have very talented people. I want to use them on this because I want it to stay low or as low as possible. President Xi. Well, I can tell you this. I speak to him. I had a talk with him very recently and he is working so hard on this problem. He is working so hard, and they’re very tough and very smart. And it’s a significant group of very talented people that are working. And they’re calling up Dr Fowchee, they’re calling up our people. We’re dealing with them, we’re giving them certain advice. We actually have through World health, we have them over there also and we have a lot of our people making up that group that went over there. No, he’s working very hard. It’d be very easy for me to say… It doesn’t matter what I say, really. I can tell you he is working… I had a long talk with him the other night. He is working really, really hard. He wants it to go away from China and go away fast, and he wants to get back to business as usual. Correct. We think. We don’t know exactly. And the flu is higher than that. It may. No because we’re ready for it. It is what it is. We’re ready for it. We’re really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We’re very ready for it. We hope it doesn’t spread. There’s a chance that it won’t spread too, and there’s a chance that it will. Then it’s a question of at what level? So far, we’ve done a great job. When you have 15 people with this whole world coming into the United States, and the 15 people are either better or close to being better, that’s pretty good. All right, we’ll do one more. Go ahead. If you tell me that’s happening, we would definitely investigate. We don’t want that. All right, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes. We’re working with China. We just did the biggest trade deal in history. We did two of them between a USMCA and the China deal. It’s the biggest in history. The relationship with China is a very good one, and I can tell you that again, President Xi is working really hard. He wants this problem solved, as hard as you can work. Thank you all. I may leave you behind and you can answer a few more questions. "
"Thank you very much, everybody. Before we begin, I’d like to congratulate all of those incredible people that have worked for so long on our endless war in Afghanistan. 19 years going on 20 years and there hasn’t been a moment like this. We’ve had very successful negotiations, we think they’ll be successful in the end, the other side’s tired of war. Everybody’s tired of war that’s been a particularly long and gruesome one. I want to congratulate President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan. I want to remember all of the people, all of the great, great men and women that have lost their lives in the war and to their parents and wives and husbands and families, brothers and sisters. It’s a great, great people. Many lives over such a long period of time have been lost.  I want to thank our wounded warriors, people that are still bearing pain and all of the problems that they’ve had to go through. They’re incredible people, incredible spirit. I’d go to Walter Reed and see them so often and the spirit they had, they wanted to go back despite their wounds. They always said, “I want to go back.” Wounded warriors, they’re incredible people. I guess most of all, I want to thank all of the people in the United States for having spent so much in terms of blood, in terms of treasure and treasury. The money that has been spent, the lives that have been lost, and we just signed an agreement that puts us in a position to get it done, bring us down to in the vicinity of 8,000 troops. The United Nations was informed of everything and NATO has been a great. Secretary Stoltenberg has been fantastic. I want to thank the United Nations for the help they gave and I also want to thank and congratulate Secretary Stoltenberg of NATO. 29 countries involved and all approving, all very happy with what’s going on. I want to also thank and congratulate Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper and I’ll be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not too distant future. We’ll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they’re going to be doing. They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going.  We’ve had tremendous success in Afghanistan and the killing of terrorists, but it’s time after all these years, to go and to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home. And again, it’s been a long journey in Afghanistan in particular. It’s been a very long journey. It’s been a hard journey for everybody. We’re very largely a law enforcement group and that’s not what our soldiers are all about. They’re fighters. They’re the greatest fighters in the world.  As you know, we’ve destroyed in Syria and Iraq, 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%. We have thousands of prisoners. We’ve killed ISIS fighters by the thousands and likewise in Afghanistan. But now it’s time for somebody else to do that work and that’ll be the Taliban and it could be surrounding countries. There are many countries that surround Afghanistan that can help. We’re 8,000 miles away, so we’ll be bringing it down to 8,000 to approximately 8,600 in that vicinity. And then we’ll make our final decision some point in the fairly near future, but this was a very spirited agreement. There was a lot of talk, there was a lot of everything. They’ve been trying to get this for many years and just it’s time.  So I just want to thank everybody. I want to congratulate everybody. I really believe the Taliban wants to do something to show that we’re not all wasting time. If bad things happen, we’ll go back. I let the people know, we’ll go back and we’ll go back so fast and we’ll go back with a force like nobody’s ever seen and I don’t think that will be necessary. I hope it’s not necessary. So I just wanted to bring that up before we begin on a topic that has become very, very important to everybody. First of all, the amount of work that these professionals behind me and many other professionals in many rooms behind us who are watching right now, don’t have the room here to bring them all in, but they have been working round the clock so hard on the coronavirus. It’s a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made. I want to provide an update to our people, to our citizens, to the world, frankly on our action to address the coronavirus and those that have been hurt badly by it.  At this moment, we have 22 patients in the United States currently that have coronavirus. Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s. Four others are very ill, thankfully 15 are either recovered fully or they’re well on their way to recovery. And in all cases they’ve been let go in their home. Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover and we think that will be a statement that we can make with great surety. Now that we’ve gotten familiar with this problem, they should be able to recover should they contract the virus. So healthy people, if you’re healthy, you will probably through a process and you’ll be fine.  Since the early stages of the foreign outbreak, my administration is taking the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the spread of this disease. We moved very early. That was one of the decisions we made that really turned out to be a lifesaver in a sense, big lifesaver. On January 31st I imposed travel restrictions on foreign nations who had and anybody that had been to China or people coming out of China. I want to say that China seems to be making tremendous progress. Their numbers are way down and if you read Tim Cook of Apple said that they’re now in full operation again in China. The numbers are way down. Experts now agree that the decision to move so quickly despite a lot of opposition on that decision was a wise one, it greatly slowed the spread of the virus to the United States. It really gave us time to do some of the critical moves that we’ve done and it allowed these great professionals to get together and figure it all out. We think they’ve done that.  We’ve taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country and we’re the number one travel destination anywhere in the world, yet we have far fewer cases of the disease then even countries with much less travel or a much smaller population. As an important part of our efforts, on Monday I’ll be meeting with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world actually. They’ll be coming to the White House and we’re talking about a vaccine and developing very quickly and they’ve already started working on it, developing very rapidly a vaccine for the virus, to combat the virus. And we’re having very good initial feedback, but these companies will be coming to the White House on Monday. Tremendous amounts of supplies are already on-hand. We have 43 million masks, which is far more than anyone would have assumed we could have had so quickly and a lot more coming.  Today, the White House Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence, they met for two and a half hours. I spent a lot of that time with them also and we came up with some ideas, recommendations, and frankly some pretty strict edicts that we’re going to be going by and Mike’s going to be discussing that. But we are really having a group of people that is so talented and they’re working around the clock and for that reason I really would wish that we could report exactly what’s happened, how well we’re doing under quite adverse circumstances, but we’re doing really well. Very, very professionally handled. Our country is prepared for any circumstance. We hope it’s not going to be a major circumstance, it’ll be a smaller circumstance, but whatever the circumstances, we’re prepared. I’d like to just ask and caution that the media, we would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved, not do anything to incite a panic because there’s no reason to panic at all.  This is something that is being handled professionally. I also want to thank, by the way, governors and representatives of our various states in some cases some more than others because they’ve really been working very hard in areas where we’ve seen indication of the virus. But I want to thank the governors and all of the representatives from all of our states. The rooms they’ve made available, the speed with which they’ve worked is really been incredible. So again, thank you to everybody. I’m going to ask Mike Pence now to discuss a little bit about travel and we have some restrictions on some travel from other countries that are having a hard time. I want to thank everybody. We’ll take some questions as soon as we’re finished. Thank you very much. No. No. No. Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them not… I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax. That’s just a continuation of the hoax, whether it’s the impeachment hoax or the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. This is what I’m talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff, but the way they refer to it because these people have done such an incredible job and I don’t like it when they are criticizing these people and that’s the hoax. That’s what I’m talking about. That’s a very dishonest question because he has had that ability to do virtually whatever he’s wanted to do and in fact- In fact he was never muzzled. I think I can speak… You can speak… Why don’t you speak to that? Very dishonest question, but that’s okay. We are looking also Southern border. In fact, some of the folks are here right now.  is here someplace and yes, we are thinking about Southern border. We have received a lot of power on the Southern border over the last couple of years from the courts, but we are looking at that very strongly. Well, I hope they don’t change their routine, but maybe Anthony, I’ll let you answer that or Bob. Do you want to answer that? We care very much for the troops. We’re in constant touch with the troops. We’ve been speaking to the general, as you probably know, 32,000 troops in South Korea and that’s all working out fine and we’re in touch… We were in touch with the authorities in South Korea too. Okay. So again, the hoax was used with respect to Democrats and what they were saying. It was a hoax what they were saying and that was very clear if you’d read the words and I think you know that too. As far as what responsibility, my great responsibility… I think the biggest decision we made was going very early and that was a decision made against a lot of people that thought we shouldn’t do that. That’s why we’re at 22 instead of a much higher number, would have been a much higher number. That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean not even early or late, it had never been made a decision like that so that was big.  My next thing is really getting the best people in the world. They’re standing behind me. These people are so talented. I’ve seen them in action now for a number of weeks actually, but for in particular for the last four or five days. I want to thank Mike Pence and everybody for the job they’re doing. We have a great team. We have great people and this too will end. Go ahead, please. Go. Well, I think so. I mean, we lead a life. I get around. I was in South Carolina last night. We had a tremendous rally. I’ve been around. I think we’re going to be in very good shape. You know, you’re talking about 22 people right now in this whole very vast country so I think we’ll be in very good shape. He’s a terrific man. He’s been fantastic and everything he’s done. He’s highly respected. He wanted to wait till after the IG report came in as you saw originally. I don’t think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out, but he wanted to wait till after the IG report. The IG report has now come and we’ve learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report as you know very well and I think he’ll go through a process and it’ll go fairly quickly. He’s very respected man. Somebody that I’ve gotten to like, somebody who really has… He’s someone who’s really distinguished himself and I think over the last year and a half, two years in particular. We’re very happy with that.  As far as the Taliban is concerned, everybody wanted this to happen. The Taliban wanted it to happen. President Ghani was very much involved in this as you know and he’s now dealing with the Taliban, but we’re talking about 19 years we’ve been there, 19 years and other presidents have tried to do this. The Taliban has given a pledge and a very strong pledge and We’ll see how that all works out. We hope it’s going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We’ll be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end, but the job we’ve done has been a fantastic one in terms of terrorist and terrorism and it’s time for our people to start coming home. Some measures. We’ve been in very close contact with China, including myself with President Xi. He very much wanted this to happen. He wanted us to get out and finished and be done. He worked…  Wanted this to happen. He wanted us to get out and finished and be done. He’s been working very, very hard, I can tell you that. And they’re making a lot of progress in China. You probably saw Starbucks are now opened again. You probably saw that as I mentioned, Tim just came out and he said Apple is back to normal in terms of production and their facilities in China. They’ve made a lot of progress. Well we have a great relationship as you know with Mexico. We have 27,000 soldiers, their soldiers on our border doing a fantastic job. Our numbers are way down, people coming into our country illegally. We have ports of entry that we are keeping open and we’re not talking about it. We’re thinking about all borders. We have to think about that border. But right now that is not a border as it pertains to what we’re talking about here. This is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won’t have to do that. Yes please, go ahead. No, no, you weren’t. Please. Well I think our relationship with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We’re starting on another trade deal with China, a very big one and we’ve been working very closely. They’ve been talking to our people. We’ve been talking to their people having to do with the virus. No, our relationship with China is very good. Maybe it’s closer because of what’s happened here because it was… In a certain way, this can bring the world closer. If you want to know, it can really do that. Go ahead. Well first of all- We’ll look at that. Look, nobody should be criticizing this deal after 19 years. He had his chance. He didn’t do it. He was very much in favor of going in. We should have never gone in, in the first place. When they went into Iraq… Listen, listen. When they went into Iraq, when they went into the Middle East in such a fashion, I was very much against it. Shouldn’t have gone in. He thought we should have. That’s been proven wrong. I’m surprised that anybody would be against something where we try and end a 19 year war. We’re 8,000 miles away from our home, we’ve done a great job in the sense that we’ve killed a lot of terrorists. We’ve put them out of commission. Who knows what they would’ve done if we didn’t do that, but it’s time for us to come home.  Now the Taliban, working with other nations perhaps because you’re surrounded by other very strong nations. And whether it’s Pakistan or Iran or lots of other places including Russia, they can all work on this. We’ve been doing it for nations that are surrounding Afghanistan. Now it’s time for us to start coming home. And I think it’s a very good situation. President Ghani is working on it very hard. We’ll see how that works out. But the United States has done great services for people all over the world, that frankly I don’t think they’ve been given really the kind of respect that they should be given for what we’ve done. What we have done for the world is incredible and usually we don’t even get a thank you.  In Afghanistan, we did something and I will tell you for the most part I noticed he was negative, but he should have tried to do something better. He was here for a year. He could have done something better. I was all ears and he wasn’t able to do that. The deal has a chance to be extremely good, but what it does do is we start bringing our people back home. Yeah. No, no. Go ahead. Good it’s about time. No I think the Fed has a very important role and especially psychological. I mean if you look at the… The Fed has a massive impact. Lots of it is psychological and lots of it is fact. This is something I think they should have done even beyond this and before this because other countries that are not as nearly as prime, we’re the greatest in the world. It’s our currency, everything, we have everything. We should have the lowest interest rates. We don’t have the lowest interest rates. Our Fed rate is higher. You look at Germany, you look at Japan, you look at other countries, many of them have negative rates. And we are not put in that position because of our Fed and now we have this problem. You saw where Germany is lowering and also infusing a lot of money into their economy, a tremendous amount.  I haven’t heard our Fed say they should do this. Our Fed should start being a leader, not a follower. Our Fed has been a follower. We need a Fed that’s going to be a leader. We should have at least the same rates and ideally lower rates than other countries. We shouldn’t be paying more, but we’re forced to pay more on interest and we are the most prime. Think of it, biggest economy in the world by far. China would have overtaken us and this year they were expected to for five years. 2019 they were going to overtake us. They’re not even close and they won’t be close. As long as somebody smart is right here, they won’t be close.  But I will say this, relationship with them is good. But as far as the Fed is concerned, our Fed should be a leader. Our Fed has not been a leader at all. Frankly, we could refinance our debt at even lower rates. The rates are very low, but we should be refinancing debt at even lower rates. Our Fed is making us pay more than we should and that’s ridiculous. Right. I think this process will go very quickly. I think Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative, this process is going to go very quickly. And you know that- Excuse me? Yeah. We can do that. Want to do that? Okay. Would you like to say something? All right. By the way, the meeting with the pharmaceutical companies was actually set up before over drug pricing because we want prices to go way down, but it turns out to be a very convenient meeting as it pertains to the vaccine. We’ll talk about both. Well let me just respond quickly and then I’m going to have Mike say something about that because I’ve heard pretty good explanations actually. When it came to healthcare, Indiana has been a leader, an absolute leader, and it was really started with others, but by Mike Pence. And he’s done a phenomenal job on healthcare. One of the best, if not the best in the country. And with that, I’ll let Mike respond specifically if you want to. Great answer and he’s doing a great job. Go ahead. He’s doing a great job. Great answer, thank you. Go ahead. When was that? When? Okay. We’re speaking to President Erdogan a lot and we are talking to him about exactly what you’re referring to. The markets will all come back. The markets are very strong. The consumer is unbelievably strong. The companies are very strong. We have one problem. We have to get this problem brought into focus and it is right now I think our professionals are doing a great job. I’m not thinking in terms. Well it’s certainly not a good situation. When you lose travel, that’s a big part of market. But for a period of time we’re going to have to do whatever’s necessary. Safety, health, number one. And the markets will take care of themselves. The companies are very powerful. Our consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now. Larry Kudlow was telling me before that the numbers… I said don’t even bring it up, what difference? But the numbers are very strong. He’s got numbers from Friday. Very strong. You see the numbers. But our focus is on exactly this. It’s not on that. That will take care of itself. I think the big thing we’re looking for is the Fed to do its job. If the Fed does its job, that’s what we are really looking for. Where prior to this, as you know we announced that we’re going to be at the end of the year. We’re going to be toward the end of the year, we’re going to be announcing a middle income tax cut. In order to get that through, I don’t think the Democrats are going to be approving any tax cuts because they like to raise taxes instead of lower taxes. But we’ll be in the not too distant future announcing a very major middle income tax cut. Okay? Ladies and gentleman, thank you. Go ahead please. I think it’s always good to be prepared. I think it’s always good. But we are super prepared. When you hear 43 million masks as an example. I will do one more. Go ahead the gentleman. Correct. We all want to discuss arms control and that’s a wise thing. We’re spending now over $20 billion on nuclear and on the super speed missiles and many other things. And they have come to me and they all want to now discuss arms control. And that includes China and that includes Russia and I think it’s very smart of them to want to do it and I think it’s very smart of us to want to do it. And we will be discussing that in New York. One final question. Go ahead. No, no, please. Like today. Okay. Today. They’ll start immediately. So ladies and gentlemen, we’ll be doing this quite often. We’re going to keep you abreast of all of the facts and again, I want to thank the professionals. They are great professionals. I’ve gotten to really know them and see them under very interesting and tough and trying conditions. We have the finest in the world. I will say this, other countries call us and they ask would it be possible for them to speak to Anthony and Bob and the people that you’re talking to on a daily basis now. So we’re going to be very transparent. We’ll be meeting you probably tomorrow or the next day. We’ll keep you abreast. Thank you very much."
"Discuss how the federal government can accelerate the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments for the coronavirus. We want to welcome Dr. Deborah Birx. And Dr. Birx has been to the White House a lot over her career, and she’s now going to be here working with Mike Pence and everybody full-time. And we appreciate it. We appreciate it very much, Dr. Birx, and a real expert in her field. And if you’d like, you can ask her a couple of questions when we’re finished.  We’re working very hard to expedite the longer process of developing a vaccine. We’re also moving with maximum speed to develop therapies so that we can help people recover as quickly as possible. We have a lot of recovery going on. We want to see if we can advance that. It’s likely that therapies will be available before a vaccine is actually ready and we’ll seek to bring all effective treatments to market as soon as possible. Some very good work has been done on the vaccine. However, they have some good progress and you’ll be able to ask a couple of questions of the folks here. We’re also working with Congress to ensure that America has what it needs to respond to this challenge, this great challenge, but everybody’s responding very well. Since the start of the outbreak, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to protect our citizens, including closing our borders very early, a lot earlier than people wanted us to do and that turned out to be a good decision.  I ordered sweeping travel restrictions, increased travel advisory levels, established screening measures and opposed historic quarantines. We have quarantines all over the country. A lot of the Coronavirus shows the importance of bringing manufacturing back to America so that we are producing at home, the medicines and equipment and everything else that we need to protect the public’s health. And I’ve been talking about this for a long time.  That process has already started. It started long before we ever knew about this. We want to make certain things at home. We want to be doing our manufacturing at home. It’s not only done in China, it’s done in many other places, including Ireland and a lot of places make our different drugs and things that we need so badly. And it’s not good to be dealing with one or two or three countries and we do very little at home and we’re going to start doing it at home.  And we’ve been talking about that for long time. And a lot of the drug companies, because of what we’ve done in terms of incentives and taxes, they’re heading back here anyway. The Coronavirus shows the importance of bringing all of that manufacturing back to America, and we will have that started. It’s already started, frankly. It started about a year ago.  The White House Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence has been meeting daily and coordinating closely with the state and local governments. Mike had a call today with 53 governors and I heard it was a very good call and everybody’s very well coordinated and the Governors and the States, all of them, I can’t think of an exception, they’ve been really working closely with us. It’s been a very good relationship.  We will confront this challenge together and we will continue to do exactly what we’re doing and we’re going to be very successful. A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly. So with that, I’d like to introduce Mike and you can say a little bit as to your calls and some of the things that are happening today. And Alex maybe you can give a little update and then we’ll go around the room and people can introduce themselves, if that’s okay? Go ahead, please. Supplemental is moving along very rapidly. Everyone wants to get that done. Moving along quickly, Emma, please. Thank you, Emma. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Please, Anthony, go ahead. I’d like you to say something anyway, I think . Thank you, Tony, very much. Bob? Thank you, Bob. Please. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. John, go ahead, please. When do you think you could have the vaccine? When do you think you’d be able to have it, start producing it? All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Lenny? That means you’d be able to use a vaccine that early? That process would be faster than John’s? So this would be a combination of a vaccine and also it will put it in a different way, make you better quicker. That’s true. Thank you very much. Thanks, Lenny. Appreciate it. Please. And what is your timing then? What would you say? So you’re talking over the next few months you think you can have a vaccine? Yeah. And how long would that take? So you’re talking within a- Lenny’s talking about two months. In a couple of months. I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better. Let’s be honest. Ready to use - Ready to use when? Would you say. Ready to use? For next season. Go quickly. What do you say to that, Lenny?"
"Thank you. Thank you, Tony. Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Francis. Thank you. Good. Hi, John. Good. Thank you Francis. Thank you very much. Good. Well, I want to thank you all. This is incredible, and I’ve heard about you, and I know all of you by name, and now I get to meet you. Unfortunately, I get to meet you because we’re talking about this. But we’ve made tremendous progress. I know you’re dealing with other nations to help them out, because they got hit some of them very badly, and we’re talking to them also. And we’re making decisions as to whether or not we’re allowed to travel, they’re allowed to travel. We’ve been pretty severe on those restrictions, but I guess we did the right thing by being severe.  NIH is the home of, I mean I see so many different factors, and it’s true the greatest doctors, I’ve heard that for so long. I heard that from my uncle, Dr. John Trump. He a big fan of what you’ve done, and how it started and it’s really been an incredible situation. But the scientists and researchers all over the world, they say this is the best there is, and I think the world is extremely happy that you’re involved. And, Tony, your reputation is second to none. I think we all agree with that. You have to agree with that, John, right? I mean you have no choice. But the fact is that it is, in this case it’s true, and we’re very lucky to have you. I will say that the Vice President is over in the Hill, he’s just leaving now, and I told him to stay there and finish it up. But we’re doing very well in terms of getting the funding we need, the necessary funding. And I asked for X and they want to give us more than X and that’s okay, as far as I’m concerned. In this case, Francis, that’s unusual, but that’s okay. But I just want to thank everybody at NIH, and all of the great scientists and doctors, and everything. I know you’re working around the clock. I know you’ve made some great finds already, and that really makes us feel very good.  We had some good meetings yesterday with the companies that, I guess you ultimately would go to the companies, you’d have to go to the companies. So we had Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and some of the other great companies, and they were very positive as to the outcome. And therapeutics were a very big thing, because I guess therapeutics could happen faster than the actual vaccine, and certainly the result can happen a lot faster. So we’re looking for some good answers, but I just want to thank you very much Tony, and we really appreciate it. And John, thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. And you don’t have to shake hands. I see him everyday, so I don’t have to bother. So thank you all very much. Great job. Appreciate it. Well, I haven’t been asked to, but I think we’re making decisions on certain parts of those countries, as you know. We’ve already made a decision on parts of Italy, and Japan, it’s very unfortunate because I’ve seen the incredible job they did on the Olympics. As you know, they’re building a facility. It’s really finished. It’s beautiful. It’s finished right on time, as usual with the Japanese, the Prime Minister, very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Abe. And so I don’t know what they’re going to do. They have this magnificent facility and I don’t know what they’re going to do, but they’ll make the right decision, I know that. But yes, if it was necessary I would do it. Yes. Well we’re looking at different areas and we’ll make that decision with these professionals. We made an early decision based on a little bit of luck I suspect, but that was the original decision, on China itself. And China, and no offense to them, they never blamed us. It was a tough decision for them, but they fully understood. They were very reasonable about it, but that was a hard decision to make, but I guess we would’ve had a lot more people with difficulty if we didn’t make that decision very early on. But we’ll be making additional decisions as they arise, I guess, Tony. We’re not looking at it very strongly, we’re not seeing a lot of evidence in that area. We’re closing it, I guess, automatically because we have a very strong border there now. We didn’t have a strong border at all. We’ve built a 129 miles of wall, and the wall areas a hundred percent secure, but we haven’t seen any great, I don’t think we’ve seen any great evidence that that area is a problem at this moment. So we won’t have to bother with that, at this moment.  Any body? You’re so nice today, I can’t believe it. It’s NIH, it rubbed off. Say it? Well, it’s going to be a very interesting evening of television. I think it’s really going to be something. I’ve got some races going on that didn’t seem to exist a few days ago, and now Biden does come up a little bit, and I don’t know what’s happened with Bernie. I think they’re trying to take it away from him. I don’t know if that’s fair, but I guess it’s politics when you get right down to it. What’s fair? But I think it’s going to be a very interesting evening of television, and because of the time difference, California time difference, it’s going to go a little bit later than we’re accustomed to. Right? And I will be watching. Who would I like to win? Anybody. I’ll take anybody I have to. That’s the way it’s got to work. Doesn’t matter. I really just, we’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy on earth. We’ve gone up, and as you know, China’s economy has been hurt very badly long before this. We’ve done a really good job, and I think people understand that, and I’m looking at polls that are very good, but you know, whoever it is it is. We’ll take them on. We have no choice, right? Anything else? No, I have no reaction. Short term missiles? No. No. I don’t want to say that, but we had a very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban today, and they’re looking to get this ended, and we’re looking to get it ended. I think we all have a very common interest, we’ll find out about the country itself, but the country really has to get it ended. We’ve been there for 20 years. Other presidents have tried, and they have been unable to get any kind of an agreement. The relationship is very good that I have with Mullah, and we had a good long conversation today and they want to cease the violence. They’d like to see cease violence also. Well, they may be reluctant they’ve done very well with the United States for many years, far beyond military. If you look at all the money that we’ve spent in Afghanistan, we’ve spent trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, and we’re really a police force. We’re really not fighting per se. It’s a fight that if we had to, we’d win, but I don’t want to kill millions of people. We would win it fairly quickly, but I don’t want to kill millions of people. I think it’s crazy. And so we’ve been there, will be very, very soon it’ll be 20 years. And I said right from the beginning, not easy to get out of these conflicts. Very complex in terms of all of the people you have to deal with. Including, frankly, people in the Senate, people in the House, and a lot of people feel differently about things. But I’ve been amazed at how positive the response is to getting out of Afghanistan, and to moving on. And I really had a great conversation with him today, yes. I haven’t seen that report, no. I haven’t seen it. Well, we’re going to look at the uninsured, because they have a big problem and we’re going to look at the uninsured people that… This came as a surprise to all of us. Just happened to chose what could happen in life, but we’re going to be looking at the uninsured, see if we can help them out. Okay, thank you all very much. . Okay."
"Thank you, thank you. What a nice group, and thank you Marianne. I think you like Marianne a lot. I was listening. I said, “Who’s out there that they like so much?” It was Marianne. Please sit down. Please. Before I begin, I want to send my warm wishes to the great people of Tennessee in the wake of the horrible, very vicious tornado that killed at least 19 people and injured many more. We’re working with the leaders in Tennessee, including their great governor, Bill Lee, to make sure that everything is done properly. FEMA is already on the ground and I’ll be going there on Friday. Our hearts are full of sorrow for the lives that were lost. It’s a vicious thing, those tornadoes, I’ve seen many of them during a three year period, and I’ve gotten to see the results and they are vicious. If you’re in their path, bad things happen. Really bad things happen.  I went to Alabama nine months ago and I saw the devastation that that left in Alabama too, and everybody was so incredible. The people were so incredible, but so many people get killed if you’re in the path. And we’ll be going, as I said, to Tennessee on Friday. We send our love and our prayers of the nation to every family that was affected. We will get there and we will recover and we will rebuild and we will help them and condolences. Tough, tough situation. It’s such bad news when you see that.  I’m honored to be here with the National Association of Counties at your annual legislative conference. It’s a great group of people. I’ve dealt with you for a long time over the years, and every once in a while I’ll find one I don’t like, but generally speaking you’re fantastic. And when one of you are in the way, it’s very tough to get that job done. And when you’re helpful, it’s real easy and we get it done and we produce a lot of jobs and good results, and I just want to say you’re very important. People that are doing what I do before I got here, we realize how important you are. Incredible job really. I’ve met some of the most incredible people doing exactly what you do. Thank you very much.  So, in this room there are over 1,200 county leaders whose incredible devotion, talent and drive directly and profoundly improve the lives of millions of Americans each and every day. I want you to know that my administration will always be your friend and partner and ally and resource as you work to deliver an amazing future for your counties and for your communities and for the country itself. As I said in my State of the Union address, three years ago … I’ve had a number of State of the Unions already. Can you believe it? But this was three years ago. We launched the great American comeback, and we really did. We launched it with a vigor and with a certain splash that nobody’s seen in a long time. And what we’ve done in our country has really been incredible. Our country is so strong now. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve cut taxes, we’ve cut regulations. You know regulations.  You know the regulation business. I think you know the regulation business better than any group I can think of. Now sadly, about 5% of you are saying, “Oh gee, I wish they wouldn’t have cut,” but 95% of you are saying it was redundant and it was a problem and I talk about highways that would take to get approved. It would take 18, 19, 20 years. I can give you many examples too. Not even big highways, sometimes roadways, but we’ve cut regulations at a level that nobody has ever thought possible and we’ve done it with the extraordinary help of local officials, people like yourselves that worked with us and worked with the Department of Transportation and all of the other departments that we work with. We’ve got it down to where it would take sometimes 20, 21 years to get approvals for a highway. We think we have it down to two. I want to get it down to one, meaning that it could get rejected. We have safety concerns that we have to look at. We have environmental concerns, many concerns we have to look at.  But to go 20 years and then get a rejection. How about that? How many of those have, where you wait, let’s say 10 years, and then at the end of 10 years they vote and they reject you? Okay. There’s been a couple. I guarantee there’s some people in the room. I’ve been involved in a couple of them. That’s not fun. You devote a big chunk of your life to something and then you lose three to two. You go home. How did you do, darling? Not good.  A lot of power in this room. You don’t know the power you have. Yes you do. But we’ve hosted nearly 50 White House events welcoming over 3000 county leaders from all 50 states to forge powerful new bonds of cooperation. As we speak, my administration is working very closely with state and local leaders to confront the coronavirus. We’re really working hard on it. Vice President Mike Pence is leading the White House coronavirus task force. He’s doing a really fantastic job too. We have already met with state, county and health officials in 30 states and conducted regular briefings with governors to coordinate our response and contain the disease. It just shows you what can happen. Six weeks ago, eight weeks ago, you never heard of this. All of a sudden it’s got the world aflutter, but it’ll work out. But it’s just unseen. You have it all the time. Not to this extent, sometimes to a greater extent, relatively speaking, but things happen that you never would even think would happen and then you have to confront it.  You have to do a lot of good work and you take care of the situation. You people do that better than anybody that I can think of. America has the world’s most advanced public health system. We know that our county health officials play a frontline role in battling public health threats and we are working with Congress very closely to pass supplemental legislation that ensures state and county health departments get everything they need. I asked for two and a half billion. It looks like they’re going to give us eight and a half billion. I don’t think that’s ever happened to me before. So I think I should say, “I’ll take it,” right? Right? I asked for two and a half, they give me eight and a half. I say, “I’ll take it.” But no, everyone’s working together very well to prevent the uncontrolled spread of the disease. I ordered sweeping travel restrictions and did them very early, as you probably have heard, earlier than people wanted me to do them and it turned out to be a wise decision.  We increased travel advisory levels, established screening measures and imposed historic quarantines. We urge all of you to share information about basic health and safety practices with your communities back home. CDC has all of the information. It’s listed all over and it’s a good thing to refer to, but that’s why following my remarks today, you’ll hear from Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and they’re doing a fantastic job. They are working round the clock. America has the world’s greatest professionals working and they are working very, very hard. We’re moving aggressively to accelerate the process of developing a vaccine.  I met yesterday with the biggest drug companies, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson, and many of the other great companies. A lot of good things are happening and they’re happening very fast. I said, “Do me a favor, speed it up, speed it up,” and they will. They’re working really hard and quick. We’re moving at a maximum speed to develop the therapies, not only the vaccines but the therapies. Therapies is another word for cure where you have it, it helps get the people better faster and take down the severity of the illness. And they’ve done so much. If you look at what’s happened with AIDS and the tremendous job they’ve done there. We will be, as an example, AIDS free within nine years. Nobody would have thought that was possible. They are doing a fantastic job.  The revival of American strength over the last three years has put our country in the best possible position to deal with this challenge. Our economy is prospering like never before. We’ve relocated supply chains back to the United States. A lot of the chains now are back in the United States. And we’ve also, as you probably have noticed, for two years I’ve been complaining about the medicines are made outside of the United States. I want them to be back here. If there’s a reason why we can’t use a certain country for lots of reasons, I want it to be made here. And we’ve already started that process before this happened. But this sort of explains why we have to do it pretty well.  Jobs and growth have soared in the United States at a level that’s unprecedented, historic. Also we’ve had historic new investment in our country. No country on earth has had greater power to overcome adversity. What we’ve done in so many different ways, we’ve rebuilt our military, two and a half trillion dollars. It’s wonderful to have a good budget, but if we don’t have a strong military … You never want to be in a position where you’re trying to explain to people that well, at least we had a good budget, as people are running up the front lawn of the White House. No thank you. You look over, you say, “We did a hell of a job in that budget. Should’ve spent a little more money on the military I guess.” But when I took over, our military was totally depleted. It was an embarrassment and we’ve totally rebuilt our military, most of the equipment. Much of it’s already there. New planes and new missiles, rockets, do everything. We make the greatest military equipment in the world, all made in the USA. All made in the USA.  All made in the USA. Every bit of it is made here. Rebuilding our Navy. We’re rebuilding our Navy and we’re doing a job. And frankly, two and a half trillion dollars is a lot, but it’s not a lot when you think of the importance of the military. They say the most important thing that a president does is the court system and in particular Supreme Court judges. So I’ve named 218 new federal judges. Can you believe it? That’s a record. That’s a record. Only one person beat me percentage-wise. You know who that is, right? Does anybody know? Percentage-wise, there’s only one, and when you look 218, because President Obama was very nice, he left 142 to start off with. Usually you left none. I got 142. But you know who the one percentage wise was? George Washington. He had 100%. But was like 12 people. 12. At least I can say I named more him. A lot more. It was a little smaller country at the time, but he had 100%.  In our great national renewal, my administration has made engagement with local leaders a top priority because nobody understand the needs of local communities better than local officials, the people in this room. Nobody. And with your help, and we keep in touch with you, as you know, all the time. We feel very strongly about that. Our economy is right now the envy of the world. And by the way, yesterday, did you notice the market went up almost 1300 points? That’s the highest, biggest, that’s the biggest one day gain in points in the history of our country. Can you believe that one? That was a nice surprise. That took about half of the the hurt from the previous week out caused by something again that we didn’t think would happen. So that was tremendous. And today it’s up and the Federal Reserve cut rates today. Finally, finally, finally. Finally. Do it more. Do it a little bit more.  You want to be competitive with these other countries. Other countries have lower rates because their Feds, their currencies are cut to a level and their rate is cut. They play with their currency, they play with the value of their currencies. We don’t do that. We don’t do that. We have a different theory going and it really puts us at, and I don’t say necessarily to do it, but we have to be competitive with other countries. When we’re paying two points more than Germany or we’re paying more than other countries, we should be paying less than everybody else. We have the dollar, we have the strength, we have the greatest country on earth. We should be paying less. So the Fed rate is too high. It’s very simple. It’s too high. It puts us at a competitive disadvantage, especially when it comes to exporting our product to other countries. The other countries love that. I don’t like it at all.  So I’d like to see our Fed lead, instead of being led. We have created seven million more jobs since the election, and if you would have said seven million jobs, nobody would have believed that number. The optimistic projection by the previous administration was two million jobs. Said it would be two million by this time, and it turned out to be now over seven million jobs. So, that’s something really incredible. African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment have reached the lowest level in history. You know that. Median household income has hit the highest level ever recorded. If you look back and you go to President Bush, it’s $450. If you go to President Obama, and that’s for eight years, remember. If you go to President Obama for eight years, $975. And if you go to President Donald John Trump, over a period of three years, it’s almost $10,000. That’s a big difference.  So it’s much more over a much shorter period. And if you think about it, everybody take a look at it, look at the result. Our consumer is so powerful, so strong. It’s really what’s leading our country right now, the strength of our consumer. Nobody has a consumer like we have. So we’ve done a job. For the first time in nearly three decades, every single metro area in the United States has seen their income rise. Every single area. The economy of rural America … I love rural America. All that red. Rural. I love rural America. That’s great. You know, we-  That’s great. We have all those city slickers. They’re in the back. They’re quiet. They’re in the back. We put them in the back corners. That’s okay. How are you doing back there? Well, they’re still waving. Oh I love those beautiful red areas, that middle of the map. There’s just a little blue here, and a little blue, everything else is bright red.  Well, what we did, for your farmers, or it’s been incredible that USMCA. We got out of that horrible NAFTA deal, and now we have the USMCA. It’s going to make a tremendous … like day and night. And then made the deal with China, $50 billion worth of purchases for the farmer. I don’t think the farmers are going to be able to do business. So, $50 billion, the highest ever was $16 billion. The biggest purchase China ever made in a year was $16 billion, so we made it $20 billion in the agreement. And then the day before the agreement was signed, I said, “How are we doing with the farmer?” Because they suffered, of course not too much, because I gave them whatever they got taken. Nobody else would do that. Paid for by China out of the tariffs, and we had a lot left over. That wasn’t so bad. That’s why the other presidents never did it, because they didn’t quite get it.  But I will say the farmer, so they have $20 billion in the agreement. I said, “Do me a favor, make it $50 billion.” They got 1.5 billion people, right? And they said, “No, no, no.” I said, “What does it matter to you? What does it matter? It doesn’t make any difference.” Anyway, they agreed to do it. So instead of $20 billion, highest ever was $16 billion in one year, two years ago. Instead of $20 billion, they made it $50 billion. And now my people look at me and say, “Sir, the American farmer will not be able to produce that much.” I said, “Trust me, they will produce that much.”  Remember I said, “Tell them to go buy more land, and get bigger tractors, right?” we buy more land, assuming they get approval from you people. You’ve got to approve them. but now the farmers, they was so incredible, the farmer. The way when the CNNs of the world would go and interview them, looking for somebody to speak negatively, because when we’re negotiating, China is very smart, and they pulled back all their orders. They didn’t order almost anything. And they’d see the farmer. The farmers were hurt. I mean, until we started helping them out with money from China. But frankly, which was a tremendous thing actually, but the farmers never said anything bad. Normally they’d say, “Oh, it’s terrible what he’s doing.” Well you have to make the deal. There’s some suffering going on. It’s an operation. It’s like an operation. And the farmer, the American farmer, I don’t know that I’ve seen almost anybody, and they tried to stick that microphone, “What do you think of the horrible thing where President Trump is in a trade war with China?” And they’d say, “Sir, it should have been done a long time ago. It’s painful, but this should’ve been 15 and 20 years ago.”  And then CNN would pull that mic away, “I don’t like this guy. Let’s find somebody else.” and they’d put it in front of somebody else. And then they’d interview women in the rural communities. They’d say, “Are you disappointed that you voted,” Democrats that voted for Trump, right? “Are you disappointed?” They had one about two weeks ago, right? You saw. It was a classic. I think they convinced CNN that they were going to say bad things about me, 10 just incredible women, and they convinced them. “And you are women that voted for President Trump last time. Who are you going to vote for this time?” 10, all of them, they go, “Trump.”  “What? What? What?” That was a crowd. Now, now, now. This is not supposed to be a political rally. This is not a political rally. I don’t like talking politics. We’re talking about the economy, Rural America. I don’t like talking about politics. This is a pretty wild group you have here. But it’s a great group of people. It’s a great feeling. You can feel it. I mean, we have a great group of people, and I appreciate it. The economy of Rural America has grown 30 times faster under my administration than during the four years prior to my election. Think of it, 30 times. 30 times! That sounds like an exaggeration. If it is, you’ll read about it tomorrow on the Washington. They’ll give me a Pinocchio. Well, that’s what they have. They had to get it somewhere. One thing I know, it’s grown a hell of a lot faster. 30 times sounds like a lot, but they are. They’re doing great.  Together, we’re building the most prosperous economy, and the most inclusive society ever to exist in this country. Under our massive tax cuts, governors across the country have designated nearly 9,000 distressed community as opportunity zones, and neighborhoods are being revitalized every single day. You see that. The opportunities zones. It’s Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina has been so incredible. He came in with the idea of opportunities zones, and I don’t think there’s been anything like it. We have them all over the … thousands all over the country, and areas that haven’t seen investment in 40 years. People are putting tremendous amounts of money, investors. Sometimes you’d say, rich people are putting money in, they’re creating jobs, and they’re happy with it. Nobody has seen anything like it. It’s really a prospect. Maybe because the economy is so good, but things like that help make the economy good. So it’s been very unusual. Almost never does that stuff work. And then the government comes in with massive subsidies, and loses their shirt. This is something where people are investing in areas that they would have never ever in a million years invested in, and it’s become a tremendous success. The fake news doesn’t like talking about it, unfortunately, but one day they will, because I think you can’t help. It’s become one of the great successes.  We’re also promoting workforce development through our pledge to America’s workers. 430 companies have already committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to over 15 million Americans. And I give my daughter, Ivanka, a lot of credit for that. She came in. She said, “Daddy.” It’s true. She had a great company in New York. She wanted to just come, and just help people get jobs. I said, “Would you like to do this?”  “No, I want to help people get jobs.” She started off with 500,000 jobs, and she just broke 15 million. She did the 500,000, if you know her, I’m not surprised. She did the 500,000 like the first week, but 500,000 jobs is a lot. So she’ll go to a Walmart, and many of the great companies, and Johnson & Johnson, and they’ll hire a large amounts. I think it was Walmart that did a million people where they train them, and government is in no position to train them. You understand that. Government wouldn’t know where to begin. It would just be another program that they have that would be a disaster. So she’d go to these … no, no, you can’t. You just can’t do that.  The private companies … and they all said it’s very specific. They’re very specific needs. One of the problems we have is that we’re having tremendous amounts of companies moving back to the United States, and moving into your communities. And the problem they have is in many cases they can’t get help. And now what they’re doing is they’re taking people that didn’t have jobs and they’re training them, specifically training them. And Ivanka’s had that job, and it’s been incredible.  In the State of the Union address, I called on Congress to support my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every high school . It’s true. And I love the term vocational schools, because to me it says it. I mean, when I went to school, I had people and one person in particular, he wasn’t very good as a student, but he could after hours take apart a motor or an engine of a car, and he could strip it blindfolded, put it back together in 15 minutes. It was the most incredible thing. I said, “This is your real ability.” He just had an ability that was extraordinary, not for sitting there writing out tests, but for doing things like that, which are frankly just as important and high paying jobs. They’re really high paying jobs. And I love the name vocational school.  When I was growing up, we used to use Edison Vocational School, where they train them for cars, and for brick laying, and for plumbing, and all the things that there’s tremendous talent involved, and it was incredible. You don’t see that now, they call them junior colleges. And as junior colleges, you don’t really know what that means. What is a junior college? What does it mean? So we’re getting back to the word vocational. I thought it was very important, and it’s something that they’re very proud of, and I would be very proud also. People have that tremendous ability, and we don’t allow them to use it. We want to help every American acquire cutting-edge skills that they need for the jobs today, and for tomorrow to put more money in American pockets.  We’ve launched the groundbreaking Regulatory Reduction campaign by cutting regulations, yeah, by cutting regulations on one of the most exciting things that happened. If you look at the other side, they want to get rid of all energy. Let’s put up windmills all over your communities, right? Let’s have windmills all over the place. And solar. I love solar, but it’s not powerful enough to power these massive factories and plants that we have being built all over. But by cutting regulations, on American energy, for example, we’re massively driving down energy prices.  You see that happening, unless it’s an area or a community within not allowing that to happen, in which case, New York is an example, we’re unable to build a pipeline through New York state, where they’d love the jobs of doing the pipeline. And because of that, New England has very, very high energy prices. We could cut the energy prices in New York and New England down by half, less than half if they would allow. And we’re fighting them very hard, and I think we’ll be successful. But if they’d allow a pipeline to go through we would cut the prices of energy down by half, and even more so than that. It’s a terrible thing. It’s a very unfair thing to the rest of the country. The American energy revolution is now saving the typical family of four, an average of $2,500 per year. And I will say this, we are now energy independent. How nice is that, energy independent? Energy independent, that’s why you don’t see all those ships going out to the straits, and coming back and they keep looking for our ships. “What happened to the USA ships? I don’t see them too much anymore.” But we’re energy independent and we’re the largest producer of energy by far in the world. It wasn’t that way not so long ago, so …  And we approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, you know that. And we approve the Dakota Access Pipeline. I came in, those two, I did them on my first week or less, and it was 48,000 jobs. But more importantly, it’s actually environmentally better. You’re taking it under the soil. Nobody even sees it. You’re under the soil, as opposed to trains, and the problems that can happen. So it’s been a tremendous thing. But with us today Rebecca Long, Commissioner of Lee County, New Mexico. How am I doing in New Mexico? I hear we’re going to win New Mexico. We’re going to win New Mexico. Rebecca, please come forward and say a little bit about what’s happening on the energy boom, and your state is right up at the forefront, and we’re very proud of New Mexico. Now, if I don’t win it, I won’t say that. I’ll take it. I’ll come back and I’ll say next year, “I was only kidding about New Mexico.” Please, hi, how are you? It’s my honor, thank you very much. Perfect, . That’s great. Thank you very much. Wow. Wow. That’s fantastic. Thank you very much. . Wow, good job. Now again, we’re not getting political, because I refuse to do that. But you know Rebecca, that if Bernie, or one of these characters get in, you can close up your energy. You do know that? They have little things like, we don’t want petroleum products. Well that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot. We’re also building your wall right along the border to stop people from coming into our country illegally, right? You know that.  Say hello to the people of New Mexico. I’ll be there soon. We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated so many of your communities. You know that. You know it probably better than anybody in the country how bad it was. We have successfully renegotiated new trade deals with South Korea and Japan, who were really ripping us. South Korea, remember Hillary Clinton, great Hillary Clinton, she said, “No, no, we want this deal. It will produce 250,000 jobs,” and she was right, for South Korea. It’s true. It got South Korea 250, so you can’t say she was wrong. She wasn’t misleading us. She said 250,000. It was a horrible deal, and we’ve totally renegotiated that with South Korea. Now it’s a good deal for the United States, and a fairer deal. That was a ridiculous deal.  In January we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe, and I signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement into law, USMCA. And we also took the strongest ever action to stand up to China’s trade abuses, which frankly, for years, explain that one, what was happening with China, $500 billion a year deficits, allowing us to reach a landmark agreement that will deliver vast benefits for our ranchers, growers, manufacturers, farmers. Working closely with local officials, we’ve taken bold action to curb the opioid epidemic, which is such a problem no matter where you come from. And for the first time in 31 years, we actually went down a little bit. We went down. Some communities are down 17%, 18%, 19%. One is down 21%, but still it is a massive, massive problem for our country. Drug overdose problems are just a terrible, terrible problem. And it’s a world problem, too. No matter where you go, it’s pretty tough stuff. And frankly, I should say, no matter where you go, unless they have really, really strong measures against the dealers.  Really, really strong measures against the dealers, in which case they have no problem. I wonder how that works. How does that work, Mary, when you go to a country where they have a very, very stringent, unbelievably stringent, like probably we can’t do in our country, they have no drug problem. You go into China, you say, “How’s your drug problem?” They don’t even know… President Xi doesn’t even know what you’re talking about. We have no drug problem. They have quick trials, right? Quick trials. And I won’t even tell you what the punishment is, but let me just say it’s very swift.  You go to Singapore, they don’t have a drug problem in Singapore. A lot of money, a lot of everything, perfectly set up for a drug problem, everything perfect, but they are very, very tough and I just don’t know whether or not this country is ready for that, whether or not it can do it, but the only countries that don’t have a drug problem are countries where the retribution is unbelievably tough.  When we work together, we can dramatically improve public safety. It is just especially vital that all state and local officials cooperate fully with all requests from our courageous ICE officers. I hope I don’t insult anybody, but the ICE officers are taking people out of your communities by the thousands, including MS-13 gang members. If you didn’t have them… and your local enforcement doesn’t want to do that. These are seriously tough, crazy people in many cases. And we’re getting them the hell out of our country and we’re bringing it back to where they came from and we’re keeping them there.  And Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, so many of these countries and in the past administration they couldn’t bring the back because they’d say, “No, no, you can’t bring them back. Get out. You can’t bring them back.” So they’d fly over. They wouldn’t let them land. They wouldn’t let buses go in with these people, would have to bring them back. They don’t do that with us. With us, they say, “Thank you very much. Thank you for bringing these wonderful citizens back.” MS-13 you can have them. And now we bring them back and they take them immediately.  And we just have set records for coming through the border. We’re setting records now on not coming through the border. We built a 128 miles of wall. We’ve already got 100 and we have some going up in New Mexico just now. Well we have 128 miles and you think that was easy getting that thing… I could do anything. I could rebuild the military for two and a half trillion, but if you’re going to spend 25 cents on a wall, it was like you couldn’t do it. They would shut down the country. We actually did shut down the country for a little while, frankly, but we ended up getting the money and the wall is under construction. We’re building a lot. We’re up to 128 miles and we’ll have close to 500 miles sometime pretty early next year.  And in the area where have the walls, as you people know, because you’re also people of great common sense, you’re brilliant, but you have great common sense. That’s why you’re doing what you’re doing. At least the good ones do. The bad ones probably don’t. There must be some bad ones in the room, right? But it’s a matter of common… so much of life and so much of government is common sense. But where we have a wall, the numbers just went down to almost zero. Now they go around and that’s why the wall gets longer and longer. But the numbers have been incredible.  The Democrats used to say, “We don’t want a wall. We’ll give you drones.” They wanted to give me drones. I said, “What good are drones? They’re going to be flying around in the air, watching thousands of people cross the border.” What good are drone? No, no, we’ll give you technology. They were saying, “Walls. Walls are old fashioned.” Yeah, two things will never change a wall and a wheel. Right? Come back in 1,000 years, you’re going to have a wheel. Come back in 1,000 years, you’re going to a wall. They’re probably the only two things that aren’t going to change in life. But it is true when you think of it as that. So we have 128. We’re building it rapidly and it’s exactly what Border Patrol wanted. They did tests on every form of what you can have and it’s an expensive wall, in terms of expensive, very expensive per square foot, but it’s the kind of wall we need. We might as well… if we’re going to do it, we might as well do it right.  They had a big story two weeks ago that the wall fell down, my wall fell down. You know how I’m saying how strong it is. I always liked to brag about it, because it really is. It’s deep set into the ground surrounded by heavy concrete and steel. It’s actually made of steel on the outside, concrete and rebar inside into there. It’s got everything, right. And one of the big newscasters, they said, “The wall fell down.” I said, “Oh, this is bad. I’m building a wall. It falls down. That’s terrible.”  So, I go, “What the hell happened with the wall?” Well, sir, they had a tremendous windstorm and we were just setting it in very wet concrete. We were holding it up as much as we could until the concrete dried and the wind came at 58 miles an hour, sir, and it blew the wall over. We put it back up and we held it with cranes. I said, “You mean you were putting it up and the concrete was soaking wet?” Yes sir. We just put it in the concrete and it fell down. Oh, they didn’t say that. They didn’t say that. They don’t say little things like that, do they? I don’t know how you put up with the fake news. Americans are safest when we support the heroes of federal, state and local law enforcement. My administration… they’re incredible people. They do an incredible job and I’ll tell you what, they’re very much appreciated in our country. You read so many things, but they are very much appreciated. And ICE has done an incredible of getting very bad, some very bad people out of your communities.  My administration is also reshaping our nation’s approach to mental illness. My budget calls for almost $5 billion to improve access to inpatient mental health care through Medicaid. And as you know, county jails were not meant to deal with the mental illness problem. They weren’t. They were. Thank you. Thank you. I didn’t know that that was going to hit such a high note really. I mean, that’s incredible. I didn’t know that that was going to be appreciated the way you get it’s meant to be, but you understand the situations. You understand, the people in this room understand all of the things we’re talking about better than any people I can imagine, even people in Washington. You’re on the ground. So when you make a statement like that, that’s very meaningful to me when you give it that kind of a response. I wouldn’t have thought it would’ve had that response. It’s also not compassionate to leave those with mental illness on the streets and you see that. So we must get Americans the care that they need. From day one, my administration has worked closely with you to overcome natural disasters, such as the tornado in Tennessee. Since I took office, 62% of counties have received major emergency or disaster declarations with the federal government committing over $124 billion to support your citizens in very trying times and we get you the money quickly. We check it. We do what we have to do, but I think everybody in this room would say that you get the money much quicker under our administration than in the past. It used to be unfair. It used to be very unfair, to a point where you really couldn’t even properly do the work. It would take you so long to get the money. You were afraid to do the work. We get it to you quickly.  We’re joined today by Kathryn Starkey of Pasco County, Florida. Good place. Kathryn please come up and share your story about your community and recovering from a very big disaster that I know very well. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Wow. Thank you, Kathryn. Thank you very much. Beautiful. And I have to say, Kathryn, that you had a two governors. You had Rick Scott previously, right? And he did a fantastic job. Now your Senator, and your current governor, Ron DeSantis, and they would come to my office, say, “President, could we see you just for a minute? Oh, good.” Separately, but very similar. They wanted money. I said, “Well, what do you want?” We don’t need much. We did a little bit more for the Panhandle as an example, and I said, “Oh good.” I love the Panhandle. They got everything they needed, that I can tell you. But they’d say, “We need another little bit of money.” How much you need? 500 million more. 500 million. That’s a lot. You’ve got it. But they’d come up… it goes to the Panhandle.  Look these people, having the right governor in a state is so important. The good ones, they bug me, bug me, bug me. You have great ones in this country. You have so many great ones that Governor Lee is a great one in Tennessee. You have so many Texas, Greg Abbott. But Ron DeSantis, the job he’s doing, the job that Rick did as governor, Rick Scott. It’s so important if you’d have the wrong governor, it’s not helpful. Yes, absolutely. But if you have the wrong governor, you understand that better than anybody. If you have the wrong governor, doesn’t work.  But they would come up and they’d want to get everything set and done and they need it fast because you have to rebuild your community and debris was the biggest thing. Kathryn, right? Debris. Debris was the biggest thing. They’d bid it out and they’d had bids that were so crazy. One would be very low and the others would be very high and they weren’t allowed through red tape to use the low one. And I worked at so that they could use the low one. And we did a lot of great things, but Florida has really has done, they have done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. That was beautiful.  Everyone here is devoted and really a devoted public servant. You love your neighbors, you love your country, you love this nation like nobody else. Every day we’re working with you to build a country where every town is booming, every community is prospering. And every child has the chance to reach the American dream. As long as I am president, the federal government is on your side 100%. Thank you. Thank you.  You will always have a very important seat at the table and you will always find an open door at the White House. Many of you have come to the White House and we’ve had a lot of good discussions. No matter what community you represent, we’re all united by our loyalty to the citizens we serve and the knowledge that America is the most exceptional nation anywhere in the history of the world. To every county leader… and it’s so brilliant to have you here because you really are the people that know it the best, and I really know that much more from my previous life. This life is different, to put it mildly. I thought it would be easier. It’s actually much tougher. But I know it from my previous life. I know the talent that you have, the insight that you have. It’s really incredible, and I want to thank you for your unbelievable service. Thank you for your selfless devotion and thank you for fighting for a glorious future of American greatness. God bless you all. God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"And we’re talking about the effects of the virus on the air travel and what they see. In a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down without having to say shut down. To me, they’re to a certain extent automatically shut down. But it’s affecting the airline business as it would and a lot of people are staying in our country and they’re shopping and using our hotels in this country. So from that standpoint, I think probably there’s a positive impact, but there’s also an impact on overseas travel, which will be fairly substantial and Mike, maybe I’ll let you give a little briefing as to what we just discussed. Good, Mike. Thank you very much. I just want to add and to go a little bit further, the Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would’ve made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision. Also, when people come in from certain areas we’re doing checks, not only at the site of takeoff, but at the side of landing. So when they land in our country, we’ll also do, that’s if the planes are leaving from certain destinations. I might ask doctor, if you could, I’d like you to say a few words. You’ve been doing a fantastic job in just a short time. We haven’t had much time, but you’ve really been doing a really fantastic time. Please. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Doug, do you have anything to say? Doug is the head of American Airlines as you know. Maybe we’ll go around the room, if you’d like to say something, please. We appreciate the job you’re doing. Thank you very much. Please. Are you using different things for the cleaning, the fluids? Are you using different ? Thank you very much. Great job. Peter. Good. Thank you very much. Thanks, Peter. Chad, did you have anything to say about all that? And Chad, anything different on the southern border where we’re doing so well? We’re setting records on the southern border in terms of allowing the people that are supposed to be here in but not allowing others in. Anything new on the southern border? Good job. Thank you. Yeah. And we’re we’re doing a good job. These professionals are really amazing, they’ve really stepped up like the airlines have stepped up very much so. Thank you. Thank you very much. Oscar. That’s right. You are a heart transplant survivor. I was reading about that as one of the big executives, great executives of our country, of the world, and your heart transplant. I’ll tell you, you look very good to me, Oscar. You have that one down. Don’t recommend it, but you, that’s fantastic story. Wow, that’s great. Thank you very much, Oscar. Mike, why don’t you finish it up? Great job, Mike. As a certain areas get to be more of a problem, we may close them up as we have done with numerous areas. At this moment, we think we have it very much in hand. We’ve closed certain areas down very strongly. In some cases, not whole countries, but certain areas within countries like in Italy. We are I think doing a very effective job in terms of that. It’s very important.  The one thing that we were discussing before is you really don’t know what the percentage of some people will have this at a very light level and won’t even go to a doctor or a hospital. They’ll get better. There are many people like that. Young people seem to be, you can’t say immune to it, but there’s certainly, the numbers are very small. And it does affect the older people that, like the nursing home situation that we have on the west coast, a single nursing home where we have a pretty big percentage of people. But as things go along, so we’re trying to adjust the number, we’re trying to see what the number might be, but if you add many, many people that have it and don’t know they have it or they think they have a cold and all of a sudden they’re recovering from it. I think that number will probably be a lot different numbers than the twos and even the one and a halves that we’re hearing. And I think that’s an important thing for people to know.  I’m very proud of the people in the administration. I’m very proud of the airline business. You said it very well when you said the airline business always seems to pull together and I’ve seen that over the years and this is a great case of it. And I want to thank you all, you’re great executives and you love the country and you love what you do and thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Don’t ask that question please because they haven’t asked it. So I don’t want you to give them any ideas or you’ll end up heading an airline. He’ll end up heading an airline. That’s a pretty tough question. So I don’t. We haven’t discussed that yet. I think where these people are flying, it’s safe to fly. In large portions of the world are very safe to fly. So we don’t want to say anything other than that. And we have closed down certain sections of the world frankly. And they’ve sort of automatically closed them also. And if they’ll understand that and they understand it better perhaps than anybody. Yes, it’s safe. Well, a lot of people are doing a lot of domestic business now. I can tell you they’re staying in this country. They feel safe because we have a, if you look at a percentage, we have a very, very small percentage and a big percentage of what we have is when we brought in the 40 or so people from the ship. We brought them in, we immediately quarantined them.  But you’re adding that to the numbers that we had, which were very small. Now what we’re going to do is as people get better, because most of these people are getting better. Some are already released, some are going home, some get a full 100% report. We’re going to take them off the list. But we have a very small number of people in this country. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40 plus people, they’re Americans. I mean, I could say don’t let them into the country, but these are Americans and they were literally stranded and it was very unfair. We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers, but if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.  We’ve all done a very good job, all of us. And I think the news has been in the, for the most part, the media has really treated us very fairly, which I appreciate. I think it’s very important. Ask the head of American Airlines or United Airlines. Maybe Dr. Burks, Dr. Burks, you can maybe say something. And I haven’t touched my face in weeks and weeks. It’s been weeks. I miss it. Doug, what would you say about that? I would think, Oscar, how would you handle that? You have a lot of people they’ve booked and now made a- I think people are going to be very impressed with what the airlines do. Well, let’s talk about it. Go ahead. This was a very big move and it was something that we had to do and we did it very quickly and now we have tremendous flexibility, many, many more sites, many, many more people. And you couldn’t have had that under the Obama rule and we ended that rule very quickly. Yes. Go ahead, Chad. And much of that has been done already. Thank you very much everybody. No questions on the election? This has to be . I think the election was a great last night. I thought it was great. I thought the results were, it was a great comeback for Joe Biden. Incredible comeback when you think about it. But if you would’ve looked, if Elizabeth Warren would have done what she probably should have done from their point of view, he would’ve won. Right? He would have won a lot of States including Massachusetts, probably Texas, definitely Minnesota. So Bernie would’ve won states that he lost I think it was fairly easily. But in particular, Massachusetts, I would say Minnesota in particular. I would also say Texas and some others. So had she, I put something out on it this morning. She was really a spoiler because other people got out in those votes in order to Joe. And those people really helped Joe by getting out early. But the couple that got out as the endorsement. In the case of Elizabeth Warren, had she gotten out, it would’ve been a very different situation I think.  It would have been a very different night. Just that one simple move. Had she left, you pick up Massachusetts, Minnesota and probably Texas and those are the three I check. I would imagine there are others that he would’ve picked up, too. So Elizabeth Warren was the single biggest factor in that election last night. It would have been a very different thing and not in a positive way for her, in a very selfish way for her. She was very selfish from that point of view. Now do I care? No, because we’re just waiting to find out who we’re running against. But when you look at it, pretty incredible. If she would’ve gotten out and endorsed, even if she didn’t, she didn’t even have to endorse. I think there’s a lot of bad blood there, but had she gotten out and endorsed, he would’ve been a lot better off. Well now I think it’s a very tough, I think it’s tough. I think Joe has an easier path right now, believe it or not. I see Mini Mike just got out and he’s going to try and save face by putting some money into Biden’s campaign and we’ll see what happens. I don’t think that’s going to have an impact. You got to look, money has to be spent wisely. One thing this whole thing has shown that you can’t buy an election. It’s a beautiful thing. Steyer put in $250, $300 million and now who knows where he is? He’s home probably licking his wounds. And Bloomberg put in probably $1 billion and sometimes you just don’t have what it takes. And I said to him, “It’s not easy doing what I did, is it?” So it’s one of those things, but it’s going to be very interesting to think that this would have changed so much because if you go before Saturday, before South Carolina, I mean, Joe had absolutely no chance according to you people.  But they used to say that about me, too. Not as much though. I think I always felt that I had a very good chance. But I’d watch and they’d say, “Well, it can’t happen.” But it happened and it happened pretty easily. I think Joe actually would have the advantage now. If you look at the states he’s going to with Florida and others, I think he’s got an advantage in those states. But again, had Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie, you’re talking about a whole different subject and that’s not even a question. You’re talking about a whole… because he would’ve gotten 80, 90 almost. I mean, he would’ve gotten most of those votes. So you’re talking about a much different… I think, well, I’ve said from the beginning, it’s partially this, it’s a big part of this, but it’s also the fact that they didn’t like seeing what they’re seeing. But they don’t like Joe either. Joe’s become, a lot of people are with Joe. If you look at those people, they’re worse than Bernie in terms of being radical left. I mean, some of Joe’s handlers and that’s what they are is handlers. I want to be nice, but they are handlers. Some of Joe’s handlers are further left than Bernie. That’s pretty scary. So it’s going to be that way. Well, it couldn’t be less powerful because look what $1 billion did. He won nothing. I mean he got so few delegates. It’s incredible. I would say probably, well, now he’s doing that because he’s spiteful and he’s a spiteful guy. I know him well, he’s a very spiteful guy, he’s very upset. He made a fool out of himself to be honest with you. And he’s not too happy about that. I think the first thing he should do is fire his political consultants because I could have told, I know, I could have told him very easily, you can’t win. You can put $2 billion in, you can’t win. Okay. Thank you, everybody."
"Does everybody understand that? Yeah, sure. Just one second. Let him finish up. Just tell them about how have you done with the testing - They have plenty of materials is what you’re saying? And they have had. Doctor, do you want to make a little statement? Thank you, I appreciate it, and the whole situation is … The testing has been amazing actually, what they’ve been able to produce in such a short period of time. You had mentioned four million tests before? Four million? What number will it be? And they started working when they saw there was a problem in China, that was many weeks ago. So they saw there was something going on in China long before anybody even heard of it. That was actually before it was even in the print. They heard there was a problem in China. That’s when they started working on this and that’s pretty incredible. That’s why we’re in good shape. Doctor? And now it’s all performing perfectly. Just so you understand, now it’s all performing perfect. They’re fantastic people. These are fantastic people. Now it’s performing very well and it has been performing very well. And as you said, you had two of the three that worked perfectly and that’s all you need is two of the group. In fact, you could have one of the three and it would work. So we had two of the three but now it’s performing perfectly in all cases. I do think what’s happening though is you have people that are sick but they don’t go to the hospital or they’re not very sick. It’s a more minor case and it could be of this virus. But we have a lot of people that aren’t going to the hospital so we’re not seeing those people. And if you did see those people, I believe,  service, the statistics actually become much better because they heal, they get better. They don’t see a doctor, they don’t see a hospital. They have a problem, they have the sniffles or a cold or , some of the symptoms, and over a period of time, a short period of time or even a longer period of time, they get better.  If you look at that, then all of a sudden you’re coming into a much lower category of risk in terms of death type risk. Because I think a lot of people aren’t going to the doctors, a lot of people aren’t going to hospitals and so you’re not seeing those people. Well, we’re considering different but we’re also considering the fact that last year you had approximately 36000 deaths due to what’s called the flu. When I first heard this four or five, six weeks ago, when I was hearing the amount of people that died of the flu, I was shocked to hear anywhere from 27000 to 70000 or 77000, and I guess they said in 1990, that wasn’t particular very bad. It was higher than that. As of the time I left the plane with you, we had 240 cases, that’s at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News. I know you love it, but that’s what I happened to be watching. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings by the way? Oh really? I heard it broke  records but maybe- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I heard you broke all  records, but maybe that’s wrong. That’s what they told me. I don’t know. I can’t imagine that. But what happened is if you look at the number, the time we left, it was 240 cases, Peter, and 11 deaths. That’s what it has been. You look at throughout the world, I mean other countries have.. South Korea and Italy, and in particular, China, have many.  Now, I also hear their numbers are getting much better in those places and I’ve heard their numbers are getting much better in China, but I hear their numbers are getting much in Italy, et cetera, et cetera. But when I hear…  So we have 240 cases, 11 deaths, everything is too much and it’s true. I don’t want 11 deaths. I don’t want any deaths. Over the last long period of time, when people have the flu, you have an average of 36,000 people dying. I never heard those numbers. I would have been shocked. I would have said does anybody die from the flu? I didn’t know people died from the flu. 36,000 people died. 27,000 to 77,000, that’s your flu. And again, you had a couple of years where it was over 100,000 people died from the flu.  So I start to say I wonder what’s going on here. Now, if you look at the percentage, the percentage for the flu is under 1%, but this could also be under 1% because many of the people that aren’t that sick don’t report, so they’re not putting those people in there, and you’re smiling when I say that.  Who are you from, by the way? Which? You are? I don’t watch CNN, that’s why I don’t recognize you.  I don’t watch it. I don’t watch CNN because CNN is fake news. Go ahead. Of course it’s an effect. It is an effect. Now, you know if you know anything about me, I like when people happen to stay in the United States and spend their money in the United States. So I think people are staying in the United States more, they’re going to spend their money in the United States,  this is ended. It will end. People have to remain calm.  I do think that if you look at the numbers and you look at the numbers from other years or on other things and you look at these numbers, it’ll be interesting to see what you find and statistics will soon be coming out. But there was a big statistic today that it’s way under 1%. It said one-tenth of 1% in one case, but nobody really knows. We’ll be able to find out.  The problem is for people to get better that don’t see a doctor or don’t go to a hospital, those people get better if they were in the numbers. The numbers would look much better in terms of death rate. Oh, I think you’ll have other things. The amazing thing, and look at the job numbers today. We had a tremendous job number today.  We had a number that when you add last month’s number, which was a correction of plus 80,000 jobs, wasn’t it a 350,000 jobs number today? That was shocking. I was watching a particular network and they said on the net, but they’re pros, they said, “Wow, these are unbelievable numbers.” They were shocked by the numbers. Over 350,000, when you add last month’s correction. Peter? I think it’s fine if they want to do it. I don’t think it’s an overreaction, but I wouldn’t be generally inclined to do it. I really wouldn’t be. Now, it depends on what country you’re talking about. If you’re talking about if they’re going to another country, or are you talking about within the United States? Yeah, they have to feel comfortable. People have to feel comfortable to have a good time. If you look at do I want to go to China, do I want to go to certain parts of Italy, do I want to go to South Korea, right now? That’s a different decision. But you have some parts of the world and some parts, many, most parts of the country.  In this big vast land of ours, this great country of ours, we have 240 cases. Most of those people are going to be fine. A vast majority are going to be fine. We’ve had 11 deaths and they’ve been largely old people who were susceptible to what’s happening. Now, that would be the case, I assume, with a regular flu too. If somebody is old and in a weakened state or ill, they’re susceptible to the common flu too. They would tell me just now that the common flu kills people and old people is sort of the target. And the young. Now, the interesting thing here, it’s very interesting. The interesting thing here is that the young seem to be doing unbelievable well. Actually, better than they do with the flu. Young people and very young people are doing very well, which is another thing I guess they’re trying to figure out. Not at all. No, not at all. Not at all. I’m a person that was never big on a handshaking deal throughout my life. They used to criticize me for it, or laugh about it or have fun with it. But if you’re a politician, like I walk in and the doctors have their hands out, Hello, sir, how you?” If you don’t shake hands, they’re not going to like you too much, and I guess that’s my business. I never thought I’d be a politician. I guess I’m a politician, but the fact is I feel very secure. I feel very secure. I was told that one person maybe that works someplace in the building that I’m not even sure what level, but that one person may have had the virus. And therefore, they said, sir, because of the fact that one person may have had the… It’s a big building with a lot of great scientists, frankly. One person had the virus, and that turned out to be a negative report. That turned out to be negative, and so they called me but it was already canceled. But this morning, I said, wait a minute, I’m going to Tennessee. We’re going down to Florida to have a meeting on Monday as you know, and so we’re going to Florida. I’d love to stop, the CDC. That was a big deal with Secret Service, but they’re fantastic and they worked it out, so we stopped. But it was a report, and the person, it was a negative diagnosis. No, we had another big deal. There were two of them, and there was a thing that we recommended because there was a lot of people, and we recommended that they let them cancel that one. But there was another one in a similar area. No, I haven’t. Well, I’ll tell you what, I haven’t had any problem filling them. We just had one in North Carolina, South Carolina, all over the place, and we have tens of thousands of people standing outside the arenas. So we haven’t had… It doesn’t bother me at all, and it doesn’t bother them at all. Well, that’s a big question. So I was just on the phone with Vice President and they’re trying to make a decision. Frankly, if it were up to me, I would be inclined to say leave everybody on the ship for a period of time and you use the ship as your base, but a lot of people would rather do it a different way. They’d rather quarantine people on the land. Now, when they do that, our numbers are going to go up. Our numbers are going to go up. The 240 is going to go up, and I assume that perhaps it’s a very big ship with thousands of people on it, including the sailors and the crew. You’re talking about a massive number of people. That is a big ship.  If it were up to me, I would do it that way. A lot of people think we should do it the other way. They’re Americans. They’re mostly Americans, and we have to take care of Americans. Bring them off the ship.  No, they’ll be under quarantine and they’ll be tested very carefully. Everyone is tested very carefully. Somebody said today… In fact, the Governor said a story that a friend of yours, Governor Kemp? A friend of yours was saying how tough it is to get into the United States with all of the testing. Maybe you’d like to say. But he was very impressed with how hard it is to get on the plane. He was tested two times, and then one person said three times, just to come in. We’re watching it very closely. The people are doing a good job and instead of being negative, you should be positive. These scientists are doing a phenomenal job with something that came from out of nowhere, a very short time ago. It’s all right. It’s all right. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is. But I think importantly, anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the test, and the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. If there’s a doctor that wants to test, if there is somebody coming off a ship like the big monster ship that’s out there, right now. Which, again, that’s a big decision, do I want to bring all those people on? People would like me to do that. I don’t like the idea of doing it, but anybody that needs a test can have a test.  They’re all set. They have them out there. In addition to that, they’re making millions of more as we speak. But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test, that’s the important thing and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good. We’re handling it from South Korea. We’re testing that you can’t come in from South Korea unless they go through. I’d have to ask the doctors. And this is, by the way, the highest level test. This is the highest level test anywhere. That’s a very good question. From my… Yes. From my standpoint, I want to rely on people. I have great experts, including our Vice President who is working 24 hours a day on this stuff. They would like to have the people come off. I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather it because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault, and it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either. It wasn’t their fault either, and they’re mostly Americans, so I can live either way with it. I’d rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off. I gave them the authority to make the decision. No. No. No, I’m saying whatever it is, that takes precedence over the numbers. No. I like the numbers. I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off. But if that happens, all of a sudden your 240 is obviously going to be a much higher number and probably the 11 will be a higher number too. There is probably risk to both. Probably risk to both. We’re working very closely with South Korea. Yeah. Well, we’re working closely with South Korea. They’re also in a much different position. They have a lot of people that are infected. We don’t. They’re in a much different position, but we are working very closely with South Korea. As you know, we’re allies, even though they’ve made much better trade deals in the past than we did. We’re allies with South Korea. You have heard that, right? And we’re working very closely with South Korea. And a lot of the testing is very similar testing, but they’re in a much different position than we… They have thousands of people and they’ve got some difficult right now, but we’re working very closely. In fact, they’re calling us, asking us and these people for advice. And don’t forget these are the people as an example HIV, I talked about it in speeches and other things, HIV free or essentially free within nine years now it’s a ten year process. These are the people that came up with the answers to this stuff that three years ago, four years ago you would’ve said it’s impossible. What they’ve done is incredible and to others also. If you look at what they’ve done with HIV, it’s incredible. Other countries are all calling the same people that you’re dealing with. And honestly, what you should be doing is giving them a lot of credit because this was a very condensed period of time. Even the vaccine, they’re going to have tests done in 90 days that two years ago you were taking two years to do. And their making great progress. It takes a period of time, but they’re making great progress. Other countries are dealing with the same people you’re talking to now and others in this government universe they’re incredible people, and honestly, you should be giving them tremendous credit. They have done a tremendous job.  When you mentioned South Korea, they’re dealing with us all the time. When you mentioned Italy they’re dealing with us all the time. We’re working together with China. We’re working together with everybody. But these are great people. These are incredible people, and you shouldn’t be knocking them. You should be praising them. They have done an incredible job already. I just think this is something, Peter, that you can never really think is going to happen. I’ve heard all about this could be a big deal from before it happened. Something like this could happen. I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down. We’ve really been very vigilant, and we’ve done a tremendous job at keeping it down. But who would’ve thought, look how long ago is it? Six, seven, eight weeks ago? Who would’ve thought, would he be having this subject? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow. Like it was clockwork, right? It was all going, it was right up, and then all of a sudden this came out.  All I say is be calm, we have the greatest people in the world. Everyone’s relying on us, the world is relying on us. They’ve done an incredible job in a very condensed period of time. The thing is you never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be. This is different than something else. This is a very different thing than something else. So I think they’ve done a great job. And you know what if I didn’t think they did, I’d tell you. I just don’t think that somebody is going to, without seeing something like we saw something happening in China. As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially, not from the White House, we don’t need a lab in the White House, but they saw something happening. I found it very interesting. They spotted something going on in China. When you see these labs that I just saw, I would love to have them see it if it’s possible, but they spotted something going on in China. They started working on it immediately. Just in case it should come here, and also to help China. I mean if we could find something that’s beneficial, we want to give it to China, like they’re going to want to give it to us. China’s working very closely with us, South Korea, Italy, all of them. They’ve been working very close here, but we’re doing, again 240 and 11 that’s where we are right now. We don’t have a forecast because we don’t know. We don’t know how many people have this aren’t going to see a doctor, aren’t going to see a hospital. And the higher that number is, the better the number is from the standpoint of death, the death count. They get better without seeing doctors, without seeing the hospitals. So nobody’s marking it down and I think the number is very high. I think that number is much higher, but it never gets reported because they’re not going to hospitals or doctors. The ones that get reported are people that are really sick enough to go to a hospital or to a doctor. So it makes the numbers look worse.  We’re prepared for anything, we’re prepared. We are really very highly prepared for anything. And in a short period of time, I mean what they’ve done is very incredible. And I’ve seen what they’ve done back there. It’s really incredible. And by the way, NIH, what they’ve done, I spent time over there and I like this stuff. My uncle is a great person who was at MIT. He taught at MIT for I think a record number of years. He was a great, super genius. Dr. John Trump. I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, how do you know so much about this? Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for President. But you know what? What they’ve done is very incredible. I understand that whole world. I love that world. I really do. I love that world. And they should be given tremendous credit, and the whole world is relying on us.  You hear about you’re saying about South Korea. South Korea’s very much reliant on the information we’re given them, and they’re reliant on the vaccines that we will come up with very soon we’re going to come up. Now it takes a period of time to get them tested and then put into the market. It has to be very safe. You can’t give a vaccine that’s going to be unsafe. It would be a disaster. So that’s where we are and I think these people deserve, all of them, the scientists, the doctors, I think they deserve tremendous credit. I really do. He did. So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake. Okay. Inslee. And I said, if you’re nice to him, he will take advantage. And I would have said no. Let me just tell you, we have a lot of problems with the governor and the governor of Washington that’s where you have many of your problems. Okay. So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not. Okay. And he would say that naturally.  And as I said last night at the town hall, if we came up with a cure today and tomorrow, everything is gone. And you went up to this governor who is not a good governor by the way. If you went up to this governor and you said to him, how did Trump do? He’d say he did a terrible job. It makes no difference. If we came up with a cure, right now and tomorrow everything ended at eight o’clock tomorrow morning, everything ended. He would say, Trump, did a horrible job. Okay. And I told Mike that would happen. I said, no matter how nice you are, he’s no good. That’s the way I feel. Goodbye. Good luck to CNN. They’re not testing. They’re sampling people in other countries. Excuse me. There’s a difference. I heard what he said. They’re sampling people. It’s a drive-by. They give samples. Now can we do that? Yeah, we can do that, but that’s not effective like what we’re doing. We’re doing the whole thing in one stop. They’re doing samples in South Korea. It’s a very different thing. Go ahead. Would you like to say something? The difference is that they’re being proactive. We are being proactive. We’re going out and looking for spots. Nobody else is doing that. Not by leaving samples or anything else. We’re going out and proactively looking to see where there’s a problem. We don’t have to do that, but we’re doing it to see if we can find areas which are trouble spots. I don’t even know if I agree with that. You’ll find out those areas just by sitting back and waiting, but they’re trying to find out before you would normally find out by waiting. And I think that’s great, but that’s what they’re doing.  We’re the only country in that sense that’s proactive. We’re totally proactive, and we’re totally equipped to handle it. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Bret. Thank you very much. Thank you. So great. Nice audience. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, actually, we were giving … I think really given tremendous marks. You look at Gallup Poll, you look at other polls for the way we’ve handled it. And one of the things I did is I closed down the borders to China and to other areas that are very badly affected and really having a lot of troubles. I mean, countries and areas of countries that have had a lot of problem. And I closed them down very early, against the advice of almost everybody, and we’ve been given rave reviews. And that’s why we have only, right now, it’s a lot of people, but it’s still 11 people versus tremendous numbers of thousands of people that have died all over the world. We have 11. We have 149 cases, as of this moment. This morning, it was 129. And I just see right now it’s about 149 cases. There are 100,000 cases all over the world. So we were really given tremendous marks for having made the decision. That was a decision I made to close down the border so that people from China, where we take in thousands and thousands of people a day, they stopped coming in very early, weeks ahead of where they normally would have been stopped. Well, I don’t blame anybody. I want to get everybody to understand they made some decisions which were not good decisions. We inherited decisions that they made, and that’s fine. Yes. We undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult, but I’m not blaming anybody. It just seems that the Democrats, some of them, I must say and you know it better than anybody, Bret, it’s become much better. But some of the Democrats have said, no matter what, if we found a cure and everybody is better tomorrow morning at nine o’clock, they would say, “He’s done a terrible job.” It’s just automatic. “How is the President doing?” “Terrible, terrible.” They don’t mean it. And we’ve done a great job. Again, we’ve gotten the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of a thing. And the other thing, I’m working with phenomenal people, with CDC and all of the people involved. Mike Pence is doing a fantastic job. I mean, Mike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this and really doing a fantastic job. Well, when you say “take office”, we just learned about this a very short while ago. I know, but we’re not going to be … I’m thinking about a lot of other things too like trade and millions of other things. I mean, we are doing some job with the economy. So I’m not thinking about this. But as soon as I heard that China had a problem, I said, “What’s going on with China? How many people are coming in?” Nobody but me asked that question. And you know better than again, you know, you both know that I closed the borders very early. We’ve been given A-pluses for that. Saved a lot of lives. Well, the testing, we did it as soon as we found out that it was a problem, we did it. It’s not the kind of thing you say, “Gee, I just got elected. Let’s do some testing on this.” They had some bad decisions. Some bad decisions were made. We corrected those decisions. Well, I think people are viewing us as having done a very good job. What we have to do is do a very professional job. Nobody is blaming us for the virus. Nobody. I mean, I haven’t heard that, even from some of the so-called enemies or whatever you want to call them. They’re not blaming us. This started in China. How it started, there’s question but thousands and thousands of cases in China. And it infiltrated to almost 100 countries right now. Nobody is blaming me. Well, look, we were set to hit 30,000 on the Dow. This is a number that nobody ever even came close to, and already, we have the number. And even though it’s down 10 or 11%, it’s still the highest it’s ever been by far. It certainly might have an impact. At the same time, I have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the U.S., and I like that. You know, I’ve been after that for a long time. You know that. I’ve been saying, “Let’s stay in the U.S. Spend your money here.” And they’re doing that. They’ve sort of been forced doing that. We met with the airline companies yesterday. They’re doing a fantastic job. And they’re just not flying to areas that have a big problem. So, it’s going to all work out. Everybody has to be calm. It’s all going to work out. Sure. We could have a very long-term plan. We hope that doesn’t happen, but we have plans for every single possibility, and I think that’s what we have to do. We hope it doesn’t last too long. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Well, I have to tell you, I think … I appreciate the question. I think the country is far more united than people think. And, ultimately, what’s uniting the country is success. And we’re having more success than we’ve ever had. We got hit with the virus, really, three weeks ago, if you think about it, I guess. That’s when we first started, really, to see some possible effects. But even despite that, the country we are having the greatest year. We had last year was the greatest year we’ve ever had, economically. And I think the way we unite is really through success. But when they hit us, we have to hit back. I feel that. I mean, there’s two ways of doing it, turning your cheek but I wouldn’t be sitting up here if I turned my cheek. If I said, “Okay, let them just keep hitting at me, and I won’t do it.” They’re not interviewing me right now, they’re interviewing somebody else. Maybe they won’t even be doing that, because if they don’t get ratings, they don’t interview anybody. That I’ve learned from. But you know what? You can’t turn your cheek. I mean, we get hit. Thank you. We get hit so hard, and we have a media that is you know, I say, to a large extent, it’s a part of the Democrat Party. It really is. It’s terrible. It’s unfair. I call it fake news. I’ve used that, and people are using that, I guess, all over the world right now. And that’s the way it is. We have to fight back. If we don’t fight back, you won’t be a fan of mine very long. But I appreciate the question. Thank you. You mean they’re blaming me for Schumer? Why not? Well, look, I mean, we had a justice come out and criticize me badly. And I just responded to what she said. I had it twice. And when you look at I had a very harsh criticism, as you know. Justice Ginsburg just before a debate, during the election, as I was getting elected, she came out, she had to apologize. It was a terrible thing she said. She should have never been allowed to say it. But if they say something to me, I’m not allowed to say back. You had another justice say something that was somewhat derogatory, and all I did was respond. But I didn’t respond like Schumer. Schumer that was a physical thing, in my opinion. You know, he tried to say, well, that has to do with the election. That had nothing to do with the election, the way he said we’re going to hit back like you’ve never seen before. That was a real intimidation. And the best you can say is they’re trying to intimidate so the justices vote their way. That’s no good either. But that was a physical/ That was really … If a Republican did what Schumer did, they’d be in jail right now. It’s true. Well, look, I have to state the facts. I’m not threatening anybody physically. But if we have an Obama judge, we don’t do very well. Now, we’ve appointed 220 federal judges the most, I think, in history. It’s a record. It’s a record. Because, number one, Mitch McConnell did a great job and the Republicans did a great job. But the bottom line is, President Obama gave me 142 openings when I first got there. Normally, you would have … There’s never been anything like that. Normally, you’d have no opening. Now, do you say he’s a great President? The most important thing you have to do, I say, is the military, but a lot of people say it’s judges and justices of the Supreme Court. President Obama gave us 142. It’s unheard of. If you have one, it’s like you got lucky. Had 142. We’re up to 220 federal judges and court of appeals judges, two Supreme Court justices. I mean, it’s incredible. But we were going … If you go to the Ninth Circuit, if you go certain places, it’s almost impossible to win. So I was surprised at Justice Roberts. And I have a lot of respect for him. I like him personally. I have a lot of respect. But I think that could have been left unsaid, because a lot of people, a lot of very top legal minds disagreed with him when he said it. Now, I’m just talking about the facts. I’m talking about, sort of, the facts of life. That’s the way it is. Good. Thank you, David. David, I love the question, because our EPA is much different. We’re very tough, but we get things done and we’re taking regulations off like nobody has ever seen. And I say very simply, I want to have the cleanest air on the planet. I want to have the most crystal clear, beautiful water on the planet. And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago. But you know very well, David, because you’re into the world of regulation, I think it was maybe one of the biggest things we’ve done. I’ve cut regulations more than any President, whether they have eight years, four years, or in one case, quite a bit more than eight years. I cut more than any other President in the history of our country, and I did it in less than three years. So it’s a great question. The EPA was … This is why I was able to get the country going because so many jobs were stopped by not only EPA, so many other agencies, where you’d have to go get 11 different permits for essentially the same thing. I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years for 10, 12, 14 years and longer trying to get permits. They couldn’t get permits. I got them built. A 10-billion-dollar plant in Louisiana, the Keystone XL pipeline. I gave it in my first week. I got approval. The Dakota Access Pipeline, I got the approval. 48,000 jobs. And, frankly, it’s more environmentally, it’s better than having a train going up and down tracks, and you don’t know what happens with the train. Plenty of bad things happen with those trains. Here, you’re underground, environmentally better. So I think it’s a great question. One of the reasons the economy is so strong is because of what we did with regulations. If the other side, we’ll call it the other side, affectionately got in, they would have made regulations much, much tougher. Thank you.  Thank you. I think they thought you were going to give them a different answer, and that’s why they asked you that question. That sounded like a set-up question. But, David, you’re my man. David is my man. I like that. Well, Martha, this area of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania itself has the best numbers it’s ever had. It’s got the best economy it’s ever had. It has the best unemployment numbers it’s ever had. And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers and employment numbers too that they’ve ever had by far. So we’re very happy about the job. The people in Pennsylvania, they’re very happy with the job. You know, it was 30 years since a Republican won Pennsylvania, and based on results, I think we’ll win it again very easily. Well, look, if she’s a true progressive, which probably she is, she should have dropped out three days ago. It would have been a whole different race. Texas was close. She got votes. She didn’t do well, but she got a lot of votes, far more than the difference. Think about Maine. Maine was almost a tie. They had to wait a day and a half before they could even call it, it was so close. She, I guess, came in third, and it was very distant third, but she got a lot of votes. Maine would have gone to … I think he would have gotten everything, right? Bernie Sanders would have won five, six, seven states. Would’ve won Minnesota. Would’ve won, at least, another two or three states. So when you look at it, she did him no favors. That was not a good friendship. We started to see that during the debates, by the way. That one became unhinged. But if she would have gone out, she didn’t even have to endorse him. If she just dropped out of the race, without an endorsement, he would have won a tremendous number of states that he lost. You know, he lost states by not very much, and she got enough votes that it would have made a big difference. I think he would be leading by a lot right now had she not been in the race. So it was a fake impeachment. We had a hundred … Think of it. And the Republicans in the House, we had 196 votes in favor, zero from the Republicans. Zero against. We picked up three Democrat votes on top of that. And we had one Democrat was so angry by it, that he left the party and became a Republican which I think is a first time, because he left a majority and went into a minority. Van Drew. And it was a whole fake deal. And everybody knows that. I made a phone call. It was a perfect phone call. There was nothing wrong with it. And they said, “Let’s impeach.” Now, the real backstory is when the phony whistleblower, who’s a total phony, he heard the call, supposedly through somebody, through the informant. Do you notice the way everybody disappeared? Thank goodness I had a transcriber. We had more than one. Thank goodness we had that call transcribed, because the transcripts of the call revealed that it was a perfect call. By that time, they were already talking about impeachment. And they were going by a phony whistleblower rendition of a call that didn’t exist. Just like Adam Schiff, he goes before Congress and he starts talking about eight quid pro quos and “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.” Well, that’s a mob expression. “Don’t call me …” And everybody saying, “That’s a terrible call.” He made it up. It was totally made up. And I said, “Good. We’ll sue him. We’ll take him down.” And then I find out he’s got immunity because he made it in Congress. It should almost be the opposite. You should almost have to be more honest if you’re in Congress. I think that Biden has been damaged, yeah. A lot of people. I saw a couple of statements very strong statements by very respected people in your world, saying they aimed at Trump but they took Biden down. And, really, that’s what happened, when you think. Because you look at the son, here’s a guy, didn’t have a job, who was unfortunately sadly, the military was a very sad experience for him. He goes out, he gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt. Worse just as bad China, I just made a great China deal. China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs. Billions of dollars. I mean, to a point where my farmers are in love with me because I took some of that money and gave it to them. But his son walks out of China with a billion and a half dollars for a fund. Now, a billion and a half dollars for fund meaning he’s going to make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, and much more than that. I’ll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen. You know, we get ready for things, right? So, mentally, I’m all set for Bernie. Communist, I had everything down. He’s a communist. I was all set. And then we have this crazy thing that happened, right? On Tuesday, which he thought was Thursday. But he also said 150 million people were killed with guns and he was running for the United States Senate. “Support me, I’m running for the United States.” There’s something going on there. But I was all set. I was all set. And when I focus and we all focus, sometimes you do well and some people choke. I watched Mini Mike choke. When Mini Mike was hit by a very mean woman, he said, “Get me off this stage. Just get me off.” And that wasn’t a pretty sight to be … But I was all set to take on Bernie. I was ready. And then all of a sudden, I say, “Guess what?” I went to the First Lady, who people love. I go in to the First Lady, and I said, “He just won Texas. He just won …” Et cetera, et cetera. By the way, so close. It was a whole different thing because of her. So now I’m ready for Bernie and now all of a sudden I have a whole different, you know, it’s a whole different deal. Two very different people. I think, in a certain way, Bernie would be tougher because he’s got a base. It’s a much smaller base than my base. I think a lot of my people are here because, and I did nothing to do that, but we have a lot of support in Pennsylvania and I think we have a lot of support everywhere. Look at the rallies. Look at the rallies. But I was all set for Bernie. I was ready to go. And then I say, “You know, I don’t think I’m running against Bernie.” I think it’s going to be very hard for him to come back. Part 2 Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. It’s a great question and very important, healthcare and I think it’s probably the thing that I’m most disappointed that I haven’t been able to say what a good job we’ve done. I haven’t been able to sell what a great job we’ve done.  First of all, I get rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare. That’s where you paid a fortune not to pay for horrible healthcare and insurance, and it had a tremendous impact. Preexisting conditions, 100% we take care of. But we have many healthcare plans now where it’s 60%, even 65% less expensive than Obamacare. It’s better than Obamacare, and what we really have left is the carcass of Obamacare or you could call it new healthcare, because without preexisting… without the whole thing with the individual mandate, it’s a whole different ball game. It’s a much different plan.  And what we’d like to do is totally kill it, but come up, before we do that, with something that’s great. What we’ve done is we’ve really managed Obamacare, the remaining portion, we get rid of the bad part, but the remaining portion really well. And before I got involved, you know what was happening with the rates on Obamacare. They were going up at levels that nobody’s ever seen before. We are managing it.  And I had a decision to make. This was very important. I said to my people, and we have great people, , Azar, I mean great people that are so good at it. I said, “You know, I have a little problem. Do we manage it great until we get something much better? Or do we manage it poorly and say Obamacare’s horrible.” And I said, “We’ve got to do the right thing. We’ve got to manage it really, really good.” So it’s not great healthcare, but we’re managing it fantastically and you don’t see all those stories about the rates going through the roof anymore because we know what we’re doing.  At the same time, we want to get you really fantastic healthcare. If we can win back the house, we’ll be able to do that. We have to win back the House, keep the Senate, keep the White House. . Thank you. Thank you for the question. That’s what I said. Yeah, that’s what I said, we want to terminate Obamacare because it’s bad. Look, we’re running it really well, but we know it’s defective. It’s very defective. We got rid of the worst part and that was a very important thing. Getting rid of the individual mandate was a very important thing. But we want to get something… if we can get the House, you’ll have the best healthcare, health insurance anywhere on the planet, but we have to get the House back. Now that means we have to hold the Senate, we have to get the House, we have to obviously keep the White House. But what we’re doing is managing it really well.  Now it’s a case, it’s called Texas versus… you understand, it’s Texas is suing. They want to terminate it, but everybody there is also saying… and everybody, we have our great Senator from Pennsylvania, thank you very much, Pat, for being here. And Pat Toomey, but very important… and by the way, our great Congressman, I have to say they were warriors, right? Real warriors in terms of the fake impeachment. I will tell you that.  Texas is, and it’s Texas and many states, they’re tried to terminate, but they want to put something that’s much better. They’re terminating it to put much better. And they’ve all pledged that preexisting conditions 100% taken care of. Wow. Well, you know it’s been hard, but we’ve done it incredibly. It could have been… we have things called loopholes and the loopholes are terrible, like lottery where you give lotteries, they pick lotteries and they have people coming into our country. We have ended catch and release. We have right now 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border saying that if they don’t do that, we’re going to have to be very tough on Mexico and they’re doing it, because our soldiers aren’t allowed to be there for a lot of reasons and we’re very politically correct as a nation. Mexico, perhaps a slightly less politically correct. And we have the best numbers that we’ve had in many, many months. We’ve had, I guess, it’s now 9 or 10 months where the numbers are way down and we’ve been keeping them down.  But we need the wall. And most importantly, the wall is way under construction. We’re up to 129 miles already. Where we have a wall, by the way, nobody’s coming through. Practically nobody. We will have by early next year almost 500 miles of wall. And once we have that wall, it’s going to stop drugs, it’s going to stop big percentages of everything coming in. Okay.  And we’re really, really doing the job and by the way, it’s very important, because I could’ve done a much less expensive version. I could have done a much easier version, but a version that people would get over very easily. You’ve seen the people that get caught on top. It’s very high and very powerful. We are building exactly what the Border Patrol wanted. They wanted a very specific wall. You had to be able to see through it to the other side. You want to see where the people… I thought before I got involved I said, “I can build just a nice concrete plank wall, throw it up.” That would be no good. It wouldn’t work. We built the wall that everybody has been dreaming about, in terms of law enforcement for many years. So we’re up to 129 miles. We’ll be at 500 miles in a very short distance. It’s really moving up quickly. Thank you. But I talk about it. I do. I very much, and I’ll always talk about it, because to me it’s very important. Now, the good thing about the debt is we’re paying very little interest, almost nothing. This is a great interest climate. In fact, I want to refinance the debt, but I had to fix the military. The military was depleted. I had to fix the military. It’s one thing to say, “Gee, we did a good job on the debt, or gee, we did a good job on the budget.” And you have people from other countries running up the White House lawn. Maybe they took over our country, but I did one hell of a job on the budget right?  Now I had to fix the military, $2.5 trillion dollars. We had to do other things. The country when I took it over was in very bad shape. Remember this, President Obama had… he more than doubled. He put more debt on than all of the other presidents of the United States combined. Combined all the debt of every other president. And I took it over. We had $20 trillion worth of debt on the country and actually more than that. And we had a lot of commitments for other things and on top of it, it’s one thing, you take over something and you have debt, you have a building, you have debt, but the building’s fixed up. The country was a mess. We were in all these wars all over the place- Oh absolutely. But when the trade deals kick in, now again, we were disturbed by what’s going on with the virus, but that’s going to be fine and everybody, it’s going to be fine. But that was a disturbance. But I will say this, when these trade deals kick in and when all… the economy is the best economy we’ve ever had. It’s nothing compared to what it’s going to be when the trade deals kick in. Well, we’ll be cutting, but we’re also going to have growth like you’ve never had before. We’ve never had growth like we’re experiencing. We will be experiencing when they kick in… China as an example, they didn’t do anything with us. They’re now spending $250 billion a year and that’s only for phase one. Phase two is going to be even more so. It’s $250 billion. I just made a deal with Japan with they’re paying 40 billion. They never gave us anything. All they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the country. South Korea, I’ve made a deal, and then I made the USMCA deal with Canada and Mexico replacing the worst deal, which was made by, by the way, which was made by Joe. Okay. I didn’t want to say Sleepy Joe because I want to be respected. I want to respect him. He looks like he’s going to be a candidate and I just say, “How did that happen?” So, but no, Joe Biden, in all fairness, Joe Biden made a deal. NAFTA, he approved it. He was pushing it. It’s the worst trade deal ever made. We’re terminating NAFTA. We have the USMCA. If you look at what happened between China and Mexico and Canada, what they were doing to this country, how they were taking advantage of us, they were… Canada was judging us 300% tariffs. Now we haven’t really in good shape. I don’t think it’s on the minds of too many Americans to be honest with you, but it certainly, it should be okay. And it’s good that it’s on your mind, because it’s big stuff and they do have a lot of power, a lot of nuclear power.  I don’t get credit for this, and maybe I should, maybe I shouldn’t. But when I became president, I was told by President Obama sitting in the Oval Office in our, probably our only meeting, essentially. That was enough for me. But I was told- I was at the funeral of President Bush, sat next to him and I said, “Hello.” And then I said, “Goodbye.” That’s about it. No, I didn’t like the job he did. I didn’t like the job that he and Biden did. I didn’t like the position they put us in. I didn’t like what he did to our military, our military. We didn’t even have a military. Our military was so depleted. And I tell this story yet, I hate to tell it because it’s embarrassing, but right now we have more ammunition that we’ve ever had. It’s all over the place.  We were having difficulty with a certain country. Remember Donald Trump is going to start a war right away. Well, here it is. We’re almost four years out. There’s been no war and we’re respected again. But I was told by a general, “Sir, please don’t do that.” Why? We have no ammunition. This is the condition we were left in. When you look at so many different problems that we will left, I mean and with countries… but he said, “The biggest problem we have is North Korea.” That’s what you’re alluding to and I have a good relationship with him. I said, “Did you ever call him?” The answer is yes, he did. But I will tell you, I don’t think they admit that maybe they do, but called many times and Kim Jong Un did not want to talk to him and me he wanted to talk to. And we met in Singapore, we met in Vietnam and I also went to the border, the first person ever to walk over from et cetera, et cetera. And we had very good relationship, understanding. Let’s see what happens.  But the pundents say, “Isn’t it terrible what he’s done?” He’s given…” I gave nothing. I gave nothing. The sanctions are wrong. They want to see if they can do something. But I haven’t given anything. If the other side got in, you would right now be in a big war with North Korea. Maybe it would be over by now, but you would right… almost immediately you would have started. And if you remember the rhetoric at the beginning, that was very tough rhetoric, but that rhetoric got us to a place.  And the Olympics became successful because of me in South Korea because all of a sudden they called. They said, “We’d like to be… participate.” They didn’t sell any tickets cause nobody wanted to go to the Olympics. All of a sudden, North Korea calls up and says, “We want to be a participant in the Olympics” everybody fell off their seat. That was because of me. And by the way, the president of South Korea gives total credit for that. So it became successful. The bottom line is I have a very good relationship with them. I cannot guarantee anything. But for three years we’ve spent nothing. We’re getting sanctions and we’re not in war with North Korea, which is not bad. Thank you. I did. Very powerful, yeah. So these are warriors. We’ve been there for 20 years. We’re really serving more as a law enforcement group than a military group. We could win that war very easily but I don’t feel like killing millions of people in order to do it. We don’t want to do that, you don’t want to do that, nobody wants to do that. People are tired, even the biggest hawks are tired of being there. I had a very good conversation with him. There was a group that formed. And again, they have many tribes and they have many different… It’s hard for one… There’s not like perfectly one control. I spoke to a certain man who is the leader, but the leader has not… It’s not the easiest leadership position. And the structure is… Tribes all over the place. A tribe formed and a group formed that was going to attack certain soldiers, Afghan soldiers, and the military heard about it and the military went and they took them out. That was it. I believe they really want to make a deal. I think after 19, actually going very close to 20 years, they’re also tired of fighting, believe it or not, but they are warriors and they are fighters and that’s what they’ve done for a thousand years. Just ask the Soviet Union, which became Russia because of Afghanistan. It’s a tough place. Well, I was right. I was so right. Well, Mattis said that, and I gave him more people for a short period of time and it didn’t work out, and what we were doing is policing- In Afghanistan. As far as Syria, I did pull them out. I pulled them out. We were securing the border between Turkey and Syria. I said why are we doing that? Turkey is big, Syria is fine, let them fight their own battles. What are we doing with our soldiers? Getting people killed. Now, the one thing when I came in ISIS was all over Syria, all over Iraq and we don’t want them coming to us, and it was a mess. You understand that very well. And I knocked out 100% of the territorial caliphate, 100%. We knocked the whole thing out . No, but just so you understand. So we knocked out the ISIS caliphate in vast amounts of the Middle East, and I did that fairly quickly when I came. Again, President Obama, it was all over the place. When I say we’re not doing the borders, we did leave soldiers. We left soldiers because I kept the oil. And I was always against Iraq, going into Iraq. I think it was one of the worst, maybe the worst decision ever made, but I used to say, once they were in there, keep the oil. They never kept the oil. We have an oil area near Syria and in Syria, we kept it. So the only soldiers I have over there, they’re guarding the oil. We kept the oil. So we kept the treasure. That’s okay . Well, there’s a big question about the government of Afghanistan. There’s a big question about that whole situation in Afghanistan. We’re getting along very well with everybody. We have to get our people back home. It’s not fair. We’re a police force over there. We’re maintaining things. Eventually we have to leave. We don’t want to stay there for another 20 years. We don’t want to stay there for 100 years. We want our people to come back home. Hi, Lynette. Thank you. Oh, I like that. I like you too. Thank you. Thank you. Great honor. So I gave an answer before, success, but it’s really a little bit more than that, because we’ve had great success and there is a division, there’s no question about it. Politicians have to be able to be civil. If they’re not, you have to fight back. You have to. Otherwise we’re not going to be. There’s a movement on, and I call them the radical left Democrats, and it really is the radical left, because we have plenty of Democrats that are terrific and they want to see let’s get together, let’s get things done.  There’s so many things we could do. We’ve done a lot. We’ve done more than any administration in three years in the history of our country for the first three years. And I say it all the time and the press doesn’t even dispute me and they would do that. But we could do even so much more. We talked about a great question on the border and the border question’s true, but we should get rid of the loopholes. You can’t do that without Democrat votes. I really believe we’re going to win this next election, and when we do, the other side’s going to say, “Okay, that’s it. Let’s get along. I really believe that. But we have to win the election. Good question. Well, I’m not thrilled. So yeah, it’s a great question because I’ve always felt, I don’t know from the time I was a young guy, I always felt the concept wasn’t good and then you’d read a lot of medical reports, it’s not good. Now especially they’re saying, by the way, if there was ever a time that you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it, okay? This could be it. But you know what I did? I really love the people of this country. You can’t be a politician and not shake hands. People come in and when I leave I’ll be shaking hands with people. They want to shake your hand. They want to say hello. They want to hug you, they want to kiss you. I don’t care. It doesn’t mean… You have to do that. If I went around, no, I don’t shake hands, can you imagine? I’m going to speak with a group of people and they like Trump and they come up, “Sir, thank you very…” I don’t shake hands. It’s over. I don’t care how nicely you say it. The bottom line is I shake anybody’s hand now. I’m proud of it. They’re people that I love. They’re people that I want to take care of. Now, the concept of shaking hands since this, you’re hearing a lot of stuff about trying not to shake hands. It hasn’t stopped me at all but it is a little bit of a problem. But I got over it. Well, I was kidding. I heard the other day you’re not supposed to touch your face. So I went on camera and I said, “Listen, I haven’t touched my face in weeks.” Now, obviously I’m kidding. I said, “And I miss my face.” And one of the networks said, “He said he didn’t touch his face,” and they showed pictures of it there. So I don’t know. These people. I loved my old life. The day before I announced I was running for president, that was the best period ever of my life. My company was the strongest it ever was, especially being in development and do real estate all over the world. I built a great company, but it was the strongest, because you have times when the markets go bad and then you have to fight and then the markets are good and you’re doing great. It was the strongest period of my life. It was sort of the best period of my entire life. And then I announced I was going to run for president.  And the greatest day of your life, they say, is the day before you announce you’re running for president. I don’t know if anybody’s ever heard that but they do say that about people. But in my case I won. I won. I saw as an example that they were using numbers and they were saying how much various people spent to become president. And Bloomberg spent like $550 million. It was in of all places, The New York Times, and this guy, Steyer, we call him impeachment Tom. How did that work out? Not too good. Tom Steyer spent $250 million. Another one I know, Steve Forbes, spent a lot. A lot of people spent a lot of money and I was in the middle.  In fact, this is your own money. I spent $70 million. And they said lost, lost, lost, lost, lost. Donald Trump became president of the United States, lost, lost, and I said, “Isn’t that cool? Isn’t that cool?” So, I love it. You know why I love it? Because we are doing more than anybody can imagine. Even Right to Try. For years they wanted to have Right to Try where we can use our medicines if somebody is terminally ill. So many things we’re doing- Well, yeah, I can’t walk down the street now, before I could. I was well known and we had a very successful business and even my show turned out to be a success. I had many top best sellers of things- But I could walk down the street and I could actually walk into a store. And it was fine. It was not like nobody knew me, but now, today if I ever suggested that to Secret Service, “I think I’m going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and let’s go shopping.” So it’s a lot different. So I do miss that. I miss that free life. This is not a free life. But I love what we’re doing because we’re accomplishing more than anybody’s ever. I’m viewing it as we’re saving this country. This country was going wrong. Well, I don’t want to say because I have a lot of close friends, I really do. I’m putting everybody in this fight. I get along great with our vice president. I keep hearing I’m replacing him. He’s doing a phenomenal job. He’s a great guy and a loyal guy and he works so hard. Every day I read, he’s going to put this one, he’s going to put that one, he’s going to put… If I did that would be a great act of disloyalty because he’s been great. I speak to him a lot, but I speak to all of the senators a lot, I speak to all of the congressmen a lot. We have great people in Washington. And you have great Democrats too. I speak to Democrats also, believe it or not, but we have great, great people in Washington, very smart people in Washington and it’s going to come together. It’s going to come together, and it’s going to be sooner than you think. Thank you very much."
"… In our country, probably the biggest companies in the world. I can’t imagine being much bigger, but these are the great health insurance companies and I think tremendous progress is being made. They’re willing to do things for the people and their customers and probably in a true sense beyond their customers that normally I don’t think they’d be doing. I want to thank them and they’ll ask Vice President Pence maybe to give us a little update to see where we are. That’s true, very true. We are working very closely with the cruise line industry and very, very closely. They’re taking very strong steps in terms of people going on and going off, but they’re spending a lot of money and they are working very hard and we’re going to be helping that industry. Likewise, with the airline industry, they’re taking very, very strong steps for people coming into our country, even getting off the planes, so we are working very closely with them. We’re helping them. They’re two great industries and we’ll be helping them through this patch. So far, I think it’s been going very well. You know all about the big ship that came in yesterday and that’s going along incredibly well. Working with the state of California successfully, very successfully. We’re also with Canada and with UK, so the UK is taking their people, their citizens back and Canada is about 600 people. They’re coming back and they’re being met and brought to planes and being brought up in a very, very dignified fashion back into Canada. We appreciate all the help we’ve had in that and that’s working out very well. With that, I might just ask a couple of folks if you’d like to make a statement on behalf of the industry perhaps. Would you like to make a statement on behalf of your industry? Great job you’re doing. Thank you very much. Anybody else? Would anybody else like to make a statement? Even the ones over here, you’re going to turn your head. Look at those cameras. Very good. Thank you very much. That’s great. Thank you. Thank you all. Please. A lot of people in there are taking advantage of that really strong advantage. Who else would you suggest? Dave, please. Right, thank you. Governor, . Nice to see you, by the way. Right. . Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody."
"Well, thank you very much. And, we are having a meeting, a very important meeting with the, I would say, the greatest bankers in the world, the most important banks in the world, financial centers. And, having a good discussion. We’re discussing the economy. We’re discussing how it relates to jobs and all of the things that are happening right now with the virus that we’ve become so familiar with. I’ll be making some decisions. I’ve already made some decisions, actually, today. But, I’ll be making some, some other ones that are very important.  And, I thought I’d let the press into here some of the wisdom from the folks in the room and maybe Brian, I’ll start with you. And, Brian’s the chairman and you said the man at Bank of America. Highly respected. Everybody in this room is at the highest level, highly respected.  Brian, please. Thank you, Brian, very much. Well, thank you very much, Michael. That’s good. And, I think prior to the coronavirus it was just all go. The numbers were fantastic. And, we don’t even know what the numbers are now. We’ll have to see. The numbers from a week ago were great. And, from two days ago were great. But, now, we’re hitting a patch and we’re going to have to do something with respect to getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.  Our number one priority is the health of the people of our country. And, so, we’ll be making, most likely, a statement… I’ll be making a statement later on tonight as to what I’ve decided to do and what our country will be doing.  Charlie, please. That’s great. I’m glad you saying that. That’s great. Because, maybe some of that, frankly, more so than you’ve been used to for the last three years. Right?  It could happen. David. That’s right. You’ll do it very well. And, we’ll be doing a lot of additional work with small business, as you know. We’re going to be betting many billions of dollars and we’re going to be making lots of small business loans. The banks are, too. So, we’ll be, do you have anything to say, doctor? Right. Yesterday’s, as you know, we met with the insurance companies, the top companies, the top people in the top companies, like yourselves. And, they were very generous. You know what they did with copays and everything else. They’re going all out. So, we appreciated that very much. Steve. Anything to say? Steve. Sorry, Steve. Yeah. They’ve made very good progress, the C-D-C and different places that are dealing with the problem. They’ve made really tremendous, tremendous strides. We’ll be announcing that, also. Thank you. Anybody else have anything to say? Ken? Anybody? Anybody? Thank you. Right. That’s true. Great job you’ve done, too. Please. And, how is Jamie doing? All right, say hello to him. All right? I hear he’s doing fine. That’s great. I think there’ll be a pent up demand when this is gone. I think that everything that, maybe, where it’s stamped down now, people are leaving their homes. I think you’re going to see a tremendous pent up demand. Which, hopefully, won’t be in the too distant future. Please. Great, Richard. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Anybody else? Anybody? Please. Thank you. All right. Right. That’s great. Thank you, very much. And, thank you all. Yes, please. Right. Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much.  So, I’ll be making a statement tonight probably at eight o’clock. And, we’ll be starting some additional solutions. We made a great decision on China and Asia. And, they’re healing and they’re healing at a pretty good rate. And, happy about that. And, we could start to think about getting back involved in that part of the world. And, as you know, we have a another part of the world, Europe, that’s in very tough shape. It’s having a hard time right now with the virus.  And, we’ll be making various decisions. You’ll be hearing about them at approximately eight o’clock tonight. Steve. Well, I’ll be letting you know that a little bit later. We’ll be talking about that later. All those things. We’re making a decision on. I think they’re going to be great. I think the folks around this table are the ones that finance that. And, they understand and they’re great companies. But, we’re having to fix a problem that four weeks ago nobody ever thought would be a problem. Nobody. You read about them. You read about him from 1917 and you read about him from lots of other times. But, nobody thought that we would be seeing. We were just discussing that this came out of nowhere.  And, actually, came out of China, which is the way it works. But, we are going to get the problem solved and the country is so strong. The institutions are so strong. You know, in the past you had problems with institutions. These are powerful institutions. They’re built up, they’re ready to go. And, I know they’ll be helping their customers during this short term period. We think it’s going to be a short term period. I don’t mind that. I mean, it’s actually a very good question. I was going to ask it myself. If you’ve been hearing about the various forms, Brian, of stimulus. Different. Very different forms of stimulus. What would you say would be good appropriate under these circumstances? That’s true. If we get rid of the problem quickly, everything solves itself. We don’t need stimulus. So, that’d be good. But, we are talking about various forms of stimulus. What would you think, Michael? Right. All right. Thank you, very much. Ken, go ahead. Right. I agree with that 100%. Anybody? Anybody? I think so. I think the payroll tax would be great. Democrats are not in favor of it. I’ve tried to figure out why. Because, it would be something that would be very good for the citizens, for the people. And, even longer term, for the country. So, that’s a tax that people have long been talking about either cutting or getting rid of entirely. So, Steve, what do you have? Thank you, very much. That’s C-N-N. Fake news. Go ahead. Thank you, very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Eight o’clock tonight. Eight o’clock tonight. We’ll be another five, very shortly. But, around here. Within 50 feet. Both. Thank you."

"To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a National Emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to 50 billion dollars of very important and a large amount of money for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.  In furtherance of the order, I’m urging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They’re standing right behind me and the side of me. I’m also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with governor Cuomo. We had a very good conversation and we’re working very strongly with the many states including New York.  The urgency orders I’m issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately wave revisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital all hospitals and healthcare providers, maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities, the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that’s happened in the not so distant past. I tell you what they’ve done with telehealth has incredible. It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the greatest need.  Number two, the ability to waive requirements that critical access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. The ability to waive the requirements of a three day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home; big thing. The authority to waive rules to hinder hospital’s ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don’t have any problem getting it done.  The authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself. Ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever. 10 days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on the solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests.  Other countries have called us and worked with us and they’re doing similar things or will be doing similar things as a result of that action. Today we are announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the Coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently but we don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking; only if you have certain symptoms.  Using federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We’ll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night. I want to thank Roche, great company for their incredible work. I’d also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA’s goal is to hopefully authorize your application within 24 hours. It’ll go very quickly. It’s going very quickly. Which will bring additionally 1.4 million tests on board next week and five million within a month. I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.  At the same time, we’ve been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. And we have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover this country and large parts of the world, by the way. We’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country.  Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don’t want everybody taking this test. It’s totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we’re going to be even stronger for it. We’ve learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned. I want to thank Deborah Birx and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what’s happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I’ve gotten to know her very well over the last six days and what we’ve done is we built something that was very old, very old fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. Dr. Birx, please. Thank you, Deborah. Thank you very much. . I’d like to maybe have, Tony, do you want to come up? You’ve become a … I think everybody out here knows you pretty well, but Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours and you’ve seen a lot happen, but this has been … It’s been a great experience and working with you has been terrific. Tony, please. Thank you very much, Tony. If I could, some of these folks, we know they’re celebrities in their own right. They’re the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world, and one of them is Doug McMillon from Walmart and I’d like to have Doug, if you would say a few words wherever you may be.  Doug, please. Thank you very much, Doug. Appreciate it very much. I’ll just stay right over here, and Richard, if you could come up please. Richard, please. Walgreens. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Brian Cornell, Target. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Please. Thank you very much. Great job. Is Tom here? Tom Polen. Tom? Tom Polen, please. Thank you very much, Tom. Great job you’ve done. , Quest Diagnostics. Please. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. And Matt Sause, please, of Roche. Matt. Thank you, Matt. And you can do it. You can do it. You’re a great company. David Pierre of Signify. Signify Health, please. Excellent. Thank you very much. And we’ll be changing a lot of the rules, regulations for future should this happen in the future, which we hope it never does, but it will, I guess, somewhere out there. We had some bad ones over the years and I guess that’ll continue to an extent, but we hope it never happens. But we are going to be changing a lot of the old rules and specifications and regulations. Adam Schechter, who’s really been of tremendous help. LabCorp, please. Adam. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thomas Moriarty, CVS. We all know CVS. Thank you. Thank you, Thomas. Thank you very much. Thanks. Great job. And Bruce Greenstein, LHC Group. Tremendously talented people. Thank you very much. Thanks very much. . Okay. I like that. That’s good. We’re also announcing the following emergency executive actions today. To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest in all student loans held by the federal government agencies and that will be until further notice. That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed. Based on the price of oil, I’ve also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the US, strategic reserve.  We’re going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry and making us even further toward that wonderful goal which we’ve achieved, which nobody thought was possible of energy independence. It puts us in a position that’s very strong and we’re buying it at the right price. And that’s something that would have not even been possible a week ago. The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we’re going to fill it up. It’s a good time to fill it up. I’d like to ask Mike Pence to say a few words please. VP. Thank you. Seema? Where’s Seema? I’d like you to maybe take that a step further please on nursing homes. Thanks. Thank you very much. As I said in my address to the nation the other night, all Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus. Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself. The choice we make-  … spread of the virus itself. The choice we make, the precautions we put into place, are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic which is what it is. The CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable… It’s coronavirus.gov. It’s very heavily used right now, I will say, to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities. While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low, we’ve learned a lot about this over the last two weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions. And those who are most at risk, they have not done very well. Older Americans, especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well.  We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take, and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease. It’s incredible what’s happening with the sporting world, where so many of the great sports that we’ve gotten so used to at this time of the year, they’re not going to be meeting. They’ve done a great service, actually. But that would be another way that problems could be caused.  But this is why I outlined on Wednesday night, my administration’s… The fact that we’ve issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places. But in particular, nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. We need to be consistent in adopting measures to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same whether it’s spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar, no matter where you go. No matter where you go, you have some hotspots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible, and they’re being very seriously affected.  Key among these efforts, are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adopted by many companies, universities and schools. We want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we’ve issued by CDC, and these common sense measures. A lot of it is common sense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gatherings, postpone assemblies, social functions and sporting events, stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren’t canceled, limit in-person meetings, increase scheduled cleanings, and cancel work-sponsored travel, among numerous other steps that can be taken.  Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth. And in the coming weeks, we will all have to make changes and sacrifices. But these short term sacrifices will produce long term gain. Again, I’ve said we’re learning a lot for the future and future problems like this, or worse. Or worse, it could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn, and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through and will flow through, in interesting terms, very accurate. I think you’re going to find in a number of weeks, it’s going to be a very accurate term.  In times of hardship. The true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people. Then we will get through this. All together, we will just get through it. So much progress has already been made. And frankly, the numbers because the steps that have been taken, are at a level that a lot of people are surprised… especially when you compare them with other places with far smaller populations.  The spirit and the will of our nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion. And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal, to safeguard the lives and health of our people. So we’re with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis.  As you know, we are rated number one in the world. We’re also helping other nations. Many of the nations, we’re helping them a lot. And they are doing okay in some cases. In some cases, they are not doing well at all. But we’re working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations. With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed. We will prevail. We will be very, very successful. And we’ll learn for the future. Thank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John, please. And if you’d like to ask some of the folks up here, it would be fine. Please. Well, we just don’t think they’re giving enough. We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough. We’re negotiating. We thought we had something. But all of a sudden, they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to. So we could have something, but we don’t think they’re giving enough. They’re not doing what’s right for the country. Go ahead, please. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that’s true. We are looking at many different things, as you know. Some of them, they’ve been written about very widely. But we’re going to be releasing a paper in about two hours stating quite a few other steps, very important ones. Please, go ahead. Please, go ahead. No. We have a no symptoms, whatsoever. We had a great meeting with the President of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy, a very tremendous… He’s doing a fantastic job for Brazil. As you know, he tested negative. Meaning, nothing wrong this morning, and we got that word too. Because we did have dinner with him. We were sitting next to each other for a long period of time. We’re talking about it, country to country. But we did discuss if he had a problem. It was reported that he may have it, and he doesn’t, fortunately. Yeah. Yeah. No, I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time. It wasn’t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. And what we’ve done is, redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behind me. We’re now in very, very strong shape. I think we’ll be announcing, as I said, Sunday night. This will start very quickly. We’ll have the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time. So, no.  What we have done and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future in case something like this happens again. But it was a… And that’s not the fault of anybody. Frankly, the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers, but not for these kinds of numbers. Tony, maybe you’d like to say something. And interestingly, if you go back… Please. If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late. What we’ve done and one of the reasons I think people are respecting what we’ve done, we’ve done it very early. We’ve gotten it very early, and we’ve also kept a lot of people out. Yes. Please, go ahead. Well, ask them how they did with the swine flu. It was a disaster. Next, please. Next, please. They had a very big failure with swine flu, a very big failure. Well, that was recommended to me by a group of professionals. We are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out, and we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will… you could say ban or whatever it is, during this period of time. But yeah, their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours, so we may be adding that. And we may be adding a couple of others. And we may frankly, start thinking about taking some off. Go ahead. True. I think it has been helpful. We have been working very much with China. I’ve spoken, as you know, with President Xi. They went through hell. Their numbers are starting to look very good. They’re really looking very good. We’re very happy about that. We are sharing data, yes. In fact, we’re sharing quite a bit of data, including the fact that some of our pharmaceutical companies are working over there right now with large groups of people. Yeah. Go ahead, please. Yes, sir. So we didn’t discuss the border. We’ve had a very good relationship. Just about finished with the USMCA, as you know. He called. Actually, he called me to tell me that. I think that was the primary reason for the call. At the time, his wife had not been diagnosed. She’s a lovely lady, wonderful lady, great lady. Since then, I’ve heard, read, that the result was that she has it. I was a little surprised. I think he was surprised also. We did discuss it prior, too. She’s going to be fine. But he thought that she would not most likely have the virus. Unfortunately, she does. But we didn’t discuss the border yesterday, no. Go ahead, please. If you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should, even a business question related to what we’re talking about. Well, I don’t know that I had exposure, but I don’t have any of the symptoms. We do have a White House doctor. I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. I asked them that same question, and they said, “You don’t have any symptoms whatsoever.” We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant. As far as the cruise line business, we’re with them all the way. It’s a great business. It’s a great U.S. business, frankly. I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business obviously, was hit very hard.  We had a tremendous success out in Oakland, where moved… Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K., we worked with Canada. They took their people back in. Canada’s approximately 600 people. U.K. likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom. We have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really… You don’t hear about it anymore. It worked out really well. Mike, you may even want to say something about that, because that was really done properly. Go ahead, please. I might add that we are in the process and in some cases have already done it, ordered a large number of respirators just in case. We hope we don’t need them, but we’ve ordered a large number. Yeah. Go ahead, please. Well, some were making progress. Some are not, as you know. But some are making progress. And as they make progress, as they get down to the number that we all think is right, that they know is right, we know is right, we’ll be opening it up. Some are really moving along rapidly. We hope to be able to open things up as quickly as possible. Go ahead, please. Go ahead. Right, better. Better. Not 100%, but 90%. Go ahead. Okay. OAN please. OAN. No. We have our deal with China. They’re going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and 50 billion from our farmers, and it’s a great deal for our country. It’s about time somebody did that and, frankly, phase two, we’ll start negotiating. I did read one article, but I don’t think that article was representative, certainly not in my conversations with President Xi, and they know where it came from. We all know where it came from. Yes. I just think it’s a nasty question, because what we’ve done is … and Tony had said numerous times that we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. When you say ‘me’, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask, perhaps in my administration, but I could perhaps ask Tony about that, because I don’t know anything about it. You say we did that. I don’t know anything about it. . It’s the administration. Perhaps they do that. People let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. Things like that happen. Okay, please go ahead.  We’re doing a great job. Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great, incredible doctors and business people, the best in the world. I can say that whether it’s retailers or labs or anything you want to say, these are the best in the world. We’re doing a great job. We have 40 people right now. 40. Compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount. One of the reasons we have 40 and others have … and again, that number’s going up, just so you understand, and a number of cases which are very small, relatively speaking, it’s going up, but we’ve done a great job because we acted quickly, we acted early, and there’s nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders to highly infected areas.  Please, go ahead. I hope not long, but it’s there now and it gives tremendous powers for things that we need. Tremendous power actually, and the Stafford Act and various other things that we’re involved with and have studied and memorized in so many different ways and forms. It gives the kind of power that we need to get rid of this virus, and we’re going to do it very quickly, and I hope we won’t need it very long, but whatever it takes. We’re in touch with Italy, and it’s a country that we love. We have millions and millions of people originally from Italy, and we’re working with them. They’re in, probably relatively speaking, the toughest position of all. We’re in touch with everybody. When I say everybody, we’re in touch with many of the countries that you know about that you’re writing about, and they’re calling us asking for advice. They’re asking for the advice of the people behind me. Italy’s got a tough situation, but they have really clamped down, and I think they’re going to see some very good results. It’s tough what they did. They really took their medicine, but they’re going to see some much better results.  Yeah, Jeff. Well, I’ll tell you. First of all, I’m not coming back from someplace. There was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds. I don’t know the gentleman that we’re talking about. I have no idea who he is. I haven’t seen the picture. It’s said there’s a picture of somebody, but I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day, and that night I was taking hundreds of pictures, so I just don’t know. Now, I did sit with the President for probably two hours, but he’s tested negative, so that’s good. Please, go. Go ahead, please.  I would say if you stay home, it’s not bad. It’s not bad. Now, there are certain parts of the country that essentially have zero problem. Washington’s been very tough, in particular, nursing home, but the state of Washington’s been very tough. When you talk about the 40 deaths, that’s been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well, and they all came from a certain area, unfortunately.  Please, go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. As we discussed before, in light of the results, we’re going to be looking at it and I know the task force is looking at it very strongly. Vice President, everybody. It was looking good, but the results have been building up pretty rapidly, so we’ll be taking another look at that. Yes, absolutely.  Go ahead, please. I think they have to listen to their doctors, and I think they shouldn’t be jumping to get the tests unless it’s necessary, but I think they have to listen to their doctors. I haven’t seen the picture. Somebody said there’s a picture of somebody taking a picture with me, but I haven’t seen it, but I can tell you- I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested. Most likely, yeah. Most likely. Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway. Fairly soon. We’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule. You, go ahead please. Go ahead. Yeah. That’s been true for a while, but I’ll let Mike … Why don’t you answer that, Mike? I think you have to remember though, we’re working very closely with states and to those you have a smaller form and more targeted form of government going in and doing it, like in New York where the relationship is very good. Like Gavin Newsom, where he made some very complimentary … that’s California. He made some really complementary comments the other day about how we’re working together. We worked on the ship together, but we worked on a lot of other things together having to do with this, and really, the relationship that we have, I can’t think of a bad relationship. We’re helping them, we’re funding them, in some cases, depending on what it is you’re talking about, and we’re all working together very closely. So we’ve done really, I think, a tremendous job of teamwork with the different states.  All right, one or two more, and if you have questions for these folks … Does anybody have a question for the folks up here? Who has a question up here? You have? Okay, go ahead. If you have a question, go ahead. I thought. I knew you would. I was waiting for that. Go ahead. Ask them first please. Well, I didn’t suggest that it could happen, but I could tell you it’s an industry that was very badly impacted by what’s going on with the virus. It’s a great industry, it’s a very important industry, and we will be helping them and we will be helping the airline industry if we have to, assuming we have to. So far people haven’t been asking, but if they should be asking, we want to make sure our airlines are very strong, and then in one day all of a sudden wasn’t looking so good. Interestingly, I was talking to Doug, and the numbers they’re doing from the retailing standpoint I guess because of this, your business is like the opposite. All of you have been selling a lot of stuff. Do you want to answer the question as to the hand sanitizers? Please. Okay, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, over you. Behind you. Behind you. That’s true. Thank you. On small businesses, the Small Business Administration is now stacked with money to help them, and we’re going to make the money readily available if they need it, small businesses. We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days, and he’s a great friend of mine and he’s a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly, as was I in that stadium. It was an incredible event, and I loved being with him, so just to say “hello” to him.  We talked about everything. We’ve talked about far more than just borders, and as far as President, he, likewise, he’s a friend of mine. I believe that we are dealing in good faith, that we just worked, as you know and as I just said. We just worked an incredible deal, big deal, one of the biggest deals ever made of any kind. Big, even by the standards of some of the people here, the deal with China, but I think that they want to get to the bottom of things also.  We’re working, our drug companies, our pharmaceutical companies, are working very closely with China and with India, as you know, and with all over the world, and they’re all over the world. These are magnificent companies that are very, very knowledgeable and we’re very lucky to have them, because I think you’re going to come up with, whether it’s therapeutic or whether it’s just help. Helping getting better, and then ultimately a vaccine, which takes a little bit longer because of the test periods and couple of other reasons. You’re going to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge. They’ll have it very quickly. They’ve made a tremendous amount of progress.  Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We just completed a very good meeting of the Coronavirus Task Force and they’re really doing a great job, our professionals. The results are very, very good and when you compare this to what’s happening around the world, we’re very proud of our people. There’s been a tremendous amount of coordination with states, with cities, and they’re a little smaller form of government and they have things going well, they’re coordinating with us. And certain in particular, I think California has been terrific. The relationship, New York has been really good. We’ve had some really good relationships in terms of, especially the hotspots and we’re focused on those hotspots. Some areas we don’t have no problem whatsoever and we hope to keep it that way.  Before I turned this over to our great Vice President to provide an update, I just want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by the people behind me and the people back in the various offices, including the fact that I just left the Oval Office, so we have some people there that are probably watching this or they’re just working. We’re using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus and that’s what we’ve been doing. Last week we secured an initial 8.3 billion from Congress for the coronavirus and that was quickly done and very efficiently done. I want to thank all members of Congress. Yesterday I declared a national emergency, which was a very big deal because it opened up avenues that we would never be able to open up without it and it will make more than $50 billion available to us immediately and disaster relief funds and that’s available for states, territories and local governments, so that was really good.  We also reached an agreement yesterday on a new legislative package that will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus, so it was done very, very bipartisan. It was very nice to see it, probably the cooperation. I want to thank Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, who did a fantastic job and worked with Nancy Pelosi and their representatives and it was really great, it worked out very well. And a lot of people are benefiting by a lot of provisions in the bill, which they’re going to be discussing with you today and the tremendous provisions. So that’s something that we should talk about. I was honored to see that the stock market, you were mostly there with us, set a record in a short period of time, over a 45 minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record, all time record. I think we should do one of them every day perhaps. How about five times a day? We’ll do one five times a day.  But that was something to watch and I had no idea. We walked back. I said, “So how did that work out?” They said, “Sir, you just set a new record and the history of the stock market.” So that was pretty good. And those great companies that were there, they couldn’t have been too unhappy either when you think about it, because they’re all very big publicly listed companies, so they did a good job. And more importantly, they’re going to do a good job. When you look at a CVS and Walmart and all of the tremendous people that were there yesterday, these are the biggest and the best and they’re opening up their facilities, they are opening up. They’re right now, literally working right now, on doing something that’s never been done before to the extent that we’re doing it and so we’re very proud of them.  Also, the bill provides for free coronavirus testing for all Americans who should be tested. So people that are getting tested are getting this free, they don’t have to pay. A lot of people said, “Gee, it’s a lot of money.” And it is, it’s a pretty complex test actually, and it costs money and it’s being provided free, so people don’t have to worry about that. It also provides paid sick and family medical leave for those who need it, including for those who have the virus, for caregivers and those looking after children affected by school closures. So that’s all taken care of also. And we’ll continue all of these different actions, we have other things planned. We’re going to also be working with companies that are affected financially. Our country is in the best financial shape, so different then in the past, over the years if you look at some of the real big crises we had. It was financial problems and different things.  We now are in very, very strong financial shape with all of the trade and all of the other things that we’ve been doing. It’s been pretty amazing. We hope the Federal Reserve will finally get on board and do what they should do because we’re doing things that they should be doing frankly. And we can all do them together, but they should be much more proactive. Other boards and another countries and people representing those countries are taking a much more aggressive action than our fed and for the most part. So we’d like to see the… If you look at central banks yesterday, what they did, we want to see our federal reserve be much more proactive. It’s important. But in the meantime we’re doing things that have been really well received. And I guess you saw that yesterday, at the end of the day, with what we’ve done. We have a lot of things to tell you in terms of respirators, in terms of all of the different things or the masks are being made by the millions, millions and millions. We have plenty now, but we’re ordering for the millions. We’re ordering worst case scenario, we always say worst case scenario and that’s where we’re going. So I just want to thank everybody. I think the press has been really, over the last 24 hours, I think the representation’s really been very fair, for the most part been very fair. We’re all in this together. It’s something that nobody expected. It came out of China and it’s one of those things that happened, it’s nobody’s fault. We all will solve this problem. We’ll solve it well. I think the American people have been incredible in the way they’ve acted.  And if you look at companies and sports leagues and all of the things, what they’ve done is just something very special without being told, necessarily. In some cases perhaps they were told actually, but for the most part they want to get it over with. They want to get it over with quickly and with very little death. As of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is a lot of good decisions were made or that number could be many times that but that’s based on a lot of good decisions. One or two in particular, you know that Europe was declared the hotspot yesterday, a big hotspot, number one and we made a decision quite a bit prior to that but we saw what was happening. But if you have any questions, this group will be very happy to do it.  But I just want to say they have been led by Mike Pence. They have been incredible, the job they’re doing. They’re working 20 hours a day. This man is working 20 hours a day or maybe more? Is it more? I think it’s more. Tony has been working, I’m just looking at this whole group and we’ve created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me. I watched him the other day, it was such a fantastic job you did and I really appreciate it. But they’re going to be answering questions and we have a lot of new information, so I think you’ll find it very interesting and I’ll be going back to the Oval Office. I think it’s fine if they do it. I think it’s frankly, it’s good if they do it. I think what Apple did is fine and want to keep people away for a little while, just keep them away. And when it gets better… Well, people are going and buying things and I understand that. By the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room. You did good? Let’s compare. Do you want to compare? Good. Well that means we’re all looking good. I also took the test last night- And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday, people were asking, “Did I take the test?” I don’t know, whatever it takes. A day or two days, whatever it is. They send it to a lab- … but I did take it. Only because the press- No, I’ve been urgent. This is urgent for me right from the beginning. You know that because I closed up our country to China- Because it almost becomes a habit and you get out of that habit and frankly I was a non hand shaker for the most part. I’d never believe that shaking hands, once you become a politician, and I notice it too, political people walk up to me, they want to shake my hand. I said, “Well-”  Just wait a minute, just take it nice and easy, okay? Just relax. People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out. It’s sort of a natural reflex and we’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem. Somebody comes up to you, they put their hand out you probably tend to just shake it and we’re all getting out of that. Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree. But people will put their hand out, sometimes I’ll put the hand out. You don’t think about it. People are thinking about it more and more. We have to think about it. It’s important.  Somebody said yesterday, I touched the microphone. I was touching it because we have different height people and I’m trying to make it easy for them because they’re going to have to touch, because they wouldn’t be able to reach the mic. They wouldn’t be able to speak in the mic. So I’ll move the mic down and they said, “Oh, he touched the microphone.” Well if I don’t touch it, they’re going to have to touch it. Somebody’s going to have to, so I might as well be the one to do it. But no, we all have to get away from… I mean getting away from shaking hands is a good thing and possibly that’s something that comes out of this. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the longterm because it does transmit flu and other things. We have flu in our country that kills on average 36,000 people a year, 36,000 people and that’s something that we’re not talking about. But as of this moment, we’ve lost 50, possibly a little bit less than 50 but probably 50 people. And we’re going to try and keep that number as low as possible. Well, if you don’t have to travel, I wouldn’t do it. If you don’t have to travel… We want this thing to end. We don’t want a lot of people getting infected. We wanted to end and end as quickly as possible. So far I think we’ve done a fantastic job. I really think that the people behind me have not been given the credit that they deserve, because they have done a fantastic job. When you see all these school closures, when you see… The school closures are very important, but it causes a lot of problems. The bill that we signed yesterday takes care of a lot of those problems, with children staying at home and the parents are working. Now we take care of that issue, with what we passed last night. Now it has to go through the Senate, I have to sign it, but that will happen. But I’m now going back to the White House. You have great professionals and if there’s anything that comes up- Yes. Specifically from certain areas, yes we are. And we’re working with the states and we are considering other restrictions, yes. We’re looking at it very seriously, yeah. Because they’ve had a little bit of activity unfortunately, so we’re going to be looking at that. We actually already have looked at it and that is going to be announced. No, I think I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman. He is, so far, made a lot of bad decisions in my opinion. We had this great and we will soon have again, because I think you’re going to have a tremendous bounce when this is over. I think there’s a pent up bounce that’s going to be tremendous. I think you saw that yesterday with the stock market. Now I’m not happy with the fed, because I think that they are following, not leading. We should be leading. I’m not happy because if you look at other central banks, largely they’re lower than us, their rate and their equivalent of the fed rate is lower, in some cases by two points. In some cases, that’s a lot, in some cases very substantially. And I thought that the fed would be and should be much more proactive as opposed to following our fed is following.  We have the number one currency in the world by a factor of many times. As you know, we have the currency, we have the power, we have by far the strong currency also, you look at the dollar, the strength of the dollar. Our fed is not doing what they should be doing. We shouldn’t have a fed rate that’s higher than our competitor nations. You look at Germany, they’re essentially under zero, they’re negative. There are many countries negative. Japan is negative, Germany is negative, others are negative and we’re paying higher interest rates. And what I’d like to do is frankly refinance our debt. We could refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate. We have some tremendous opportunities right now, but Jerome Powell is not making it easy. No, I have the right to remove, I’m not doing that.  No, I’m not doing that. I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge and I haven’t made any decisions on that. Totally normal. . Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. Just a quick review of the numbers as of late afternoon yesterday, let me start off quickly globally and then we’ll go to the United States. Right now there are 129 countries that have involvement with coronavirus globally. The numbers are 132 plus thousand so it’s a little bit more than 132,000, about 7,500 of which are new cases.  Importantly, and this is something we’ve mentioned over the last couple of days, that if you look at what was formally the main feeder of this coronavirus outbreak was China. They have 80,000 or 81,000 new cases, but only 11 new cases and only seven new deaths. Things have switched over now to outside of China, which has actually triggered our decision, the decision of the President to do the travel restrictions in other areas besides China. And I think it’s important to recognize that because when this is all over and it will end, you will see a curve of how the coronavirus outbreak evolved.  It’s not going to be a uni dimensional or homogeneous because countries are going to do this and then that. We’ve it already with China, we’re starting to see it with Korea, which brings us now to what we can expect in our own country. If you look at the domestic cases, there are about 2,226 including the repatriations, 50 deaths, 532 new cases and nine new deaths, which means we have not reached our peak.  Now, we will see more cases and we will see more suffering and death predominantly as the Vice President said among the vulnerables in our society, the individuals with the conditions that we spoke to and the elderly, but built in that is a challenge. And the challenge is we still have the opportunity to influence the course of that curve. What we would like to see is that when this is all over all curve was not like that.  Our curve was like this, so that’s the reason why we’re implementing the things we’re talking about. And finally I just want to make a comment about yesterday, as a physician, which is what I primarily am, who takes care of patients every day before I was doing this is that there are things that happened yesterday that I think are going to be really important to the people out there who are going to be impacted by this, but particularly by the physicians and that is the President declaring a state of national emergency because that will be what I thought the word that I use essentially unshackling us from any of the things that are going to get in the way of our implemented.  Particularly the new powers giving to the Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar, and the departments within his agency, particularly CMS, which you’re going to hear about shortly. And within that group, particularly the nursing home situation, which we’ve really got to protect. The other thing is we always get asked about testing. You saw the CDO out there, now it’s all systems go, let’s look forward.  The responsibility is going to be with us but also with them because as we get knowledge about new testing will alleviate the anxiety that we have in the world about we don’t know what’s going on, but it also will give the individual physician and individual citizen the opportunity to know where they stand. I’ll stop there and happy to answer questions later. Thank you. Yeah, sure. I think that I mean obviously when you’re a senior individual like myself, that my degree of protecting against infections is not as good as it was when you’re 30. But if you’re an otherwise healthy senior, that the things that you really have less of a risk than if you have an underlying condition. Thank you."
"Beautiful day outside. And then I think we have some great things to talk about. I’ll start by discussing the Federal Reserve. As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but to me it makes me very happy. And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve. For starters, they’ve lowered the fed rate from what it was, which was one to 1.25. And it’s been lowered down to zero to 0.25 or 0.25. So it’s zero to .25 that’s a big difference. It’s a quite a bit, about a point.  And in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage backed securities. And that number can increase, but they’re going to start with that and that’s really good news. It’s really great for our country. It’s something that we’re very happy, I have to say this. I’m very happy and they did it in one step. They didn’t do it in four steps over a long period of time. They did it on one step.  And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled. And that brings us, we’re the strongest country in the world by far financially and every other way. And that brings us in line with what other countries are. They actually have negative rates, but look, we got it down to potentially zero. So that’s a big step and I’m very happy they did it.  And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it’s about a month or two from now. So I congratulate the Federal Reserve. I think it’s terrific. Just came out just as we spoke, I wasn’t going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up.  I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications because as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know, this is from Google. They put out a release and you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out, and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.  I just had a phone call with very impressive people, the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all. And I’ll give you the names Dave Clark, Whole Foods. Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company. Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee, Jeff Haremning, CEO of General Mills, great company. Kevin Birkin President, CEO of Sysco. Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco. Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Supermarkets, Donnie King Tyson Foods. David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill. Rodney McMillan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger, big company. Doug McMillan, CEO of Walmart. He’s been fantastic. Doug was here, as you know, on Friday and he watched the market go up 2000 points on Friday. It went up 2000 almost 2000 points. Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation, and Vivek San Quran, President and CEO of Albertson’s.  So these are all phenomenal companies. He’s a great companies. We had a long conversation with them and they’re going to work 24 hours around the clock, keeping their store stocked. I would like to say that people shouldn’t go out and buy. We’re going to all be great. We’re going to be so good. We’re going to do, what’s happened with the fed is phenomenal news. What’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news. But you don’t have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they’re buying more. I remember, I guess during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they buying more than they buy a Christmas. Relax, we’re doing great. It all will pass.  The folks that we spoke to, they’ve done a fantastic job. They’re going to meet the needs of the public. They’re going round the clock if they have to and they’re committed to the communities where they’re serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they’re buying a lot of additional things to sell. But again, they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less please?” I thought I’d never hear that from a retailer. All of them are working hand in hand with the Federal Government as well as the state and local leaders to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they’ll do it. There’s no shortages. We have no shortages other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy.  It’s going to be there for a long time. We’re doing numbers and there’s a pent up demand that’s incredible. When this passes, when this goes through, you’re going to see numbers. I think, I predict, I guess I’m allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict and they’re pretty much in agreement. You’re going to see there’s a pent up demand like a lot of people including me haven’t seen before. But this has to get through.  They know they’re getting through the crisis and will require an all of America approach and that’s very important. They’re committed to remaining open during this crisis. Totally open. They have to stay open. Those doors have to stay open. They supply our country. Our supply chains in America, the most powerful in the world, and they’re all working very hard. They’re working around the clock and the stores are stocking up at a level that’s beyond Christmas time. And it’s great. It was very reassuring speaking to these people. They have a totally in hand.  There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy. Enjoy it, have a nice dinner, relax because there’s plenty.” You don’t have to buy the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they’re refilling them.  And we are using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat the coronavirus. And we will do whatever it takes and we’re doing, I think really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen. I want to thank all of the people standing behind me. These are phenomenal people and we have some of them right over here. But the people behind me have been working around the clock and they’re doing an incredible job.  We see what’s happening. We see what’s going on in other countries. We’re learning from watching other countries, frankly. This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible, but it’s something that we have a tremendous control of. I think very important the young people, people of good health and groups of people just are not strongly affected. Elderly people that are not well or not well in certain respects are a really a very dangerous group. We have to watch them, we have to protect them very much. We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable. And with that if it’s okay I’m just going to go and make some calls. I’m talking about Federal Reserve. I think it’s a tremendous thing that took place just now. I didn’t know I would be surprised on a Sunday. I don’t know if that’s ever happened on a Sunday before, but I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy. And I can tell you that I’m very happy. I didn’t expect this and I like being surprised. So our Vice President who is doing an incredible job is going to take over and I will see you probably tomorrow.  Thank you you very much."
"I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. That’s very good. I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G seven, G seven nations and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation’s governors, and this afternoon we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today. This was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom were standing with me, and that’s available.  Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes. It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way. We especially worry about our senior citizens. The White House task force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It’s all over the world. It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time. On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it and that’s what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.  Avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly and a lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments and we’ve had some promising results, early results, but promising to reduce the severity and the duration of the symptoms. And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes we’re doing, and we’re doing it in every way. And with that I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, Who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend. Thank you. Okay, go ahead. My favorite question, I ask it all the time, how many times Anthony? I think I ask him that question every day and I speak to Debra, I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion. So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is a much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where I say it washes through, other people don’t like that term, but it washes through. We’ll see what happens. But they think August, could be July. It could be longer than that. But I’ve asked that question many, many times. Yes? I think they are very scared. I think they see that we’re doing a very professional job. We’ve been working with the governors and the frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been … Usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornadoes. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally, working with people that they know because they work, like as an example, in California, in the state of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things and they’re very familiar, so they’re working on it. What you can do and all you can do is professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have really the greatest experts in the world and someday soon hopefully it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was, but this came up … We came up so suddenly look, you were surprised. We were all surprised. We heard about it.  We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden we did make a good decision. We closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was … Otherwise we’d be in a very, as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You’re looking at what’s happening in other countries. Italy is having a very hard time, but I think that what we do, and I’ve spoken actually with my son, he says, “How bad is this?” It’s bad. It’s bad, but we’re going to, we’re going to be hopefully a case not a worst case and that’s what we’re working for. Yes? Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much and we are … We’ve been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe but we were very, very early with China and other places and fortunately we were. And as far as containment here, we are. We’re coming out with strong suggestions and it’s becoming a little bit automatic. You look at people, they’re not doing certain things. For instance, obviously not … I wouldn’t say the restaurant business is booming and bars and grills and all. People are self- containing for to a large extent. We look forward to the day when we can get back to normal. What’s your second question? At this point, not nationwide, but, well, there was some point … Some places in our nation that are not very effected at all, but we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We’ll be looking at that, but at this moment, no, we’re not.  … call them. We’ll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we’re not. I had my test. It was late Friday night. The reason I did it was because the … I had no symptoms whatsoever. The doctor said, “You have no symptoms so we don’t see any reason.” But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” Very late on Friday night I did the test. The doctor may have put out something. I don’t know what time the letter went out. Maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back I believe the following day. We tested negative. I told them that and I went totally by what they said, the doctors, more than one. They said you don’t have any of the symptoms. They checked what you’re supposed to check and that I didn’t have symptoms, but I did a test late on Friday night. It came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs. It came back later. Yeah, please. If they can get them faster by getting them on their own, in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government. If they’re able to get ventilators, respirators, if they’re able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government.  We have stockpiles now where we’re ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks, and they’re ordered. They’re coming. We have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot. But if they can get them directly, it’s always going to be faster if they could get them directly if they need them. I’ve given them authorization to order directly. That’s right. First of all, we hope we don’t get there. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why we’re taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas and not only looking, we’re expanding certain areas. We’re taking over buildings that aren’t used. We’re doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don’t have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard. We’re looking at that and we may be expanding that. We are looking at that. We want fairness. We want it for everybody. No, we’re looking at that through the Senate, because as you know the Senate is now digesting that bill. We may very well be adding something on that. Good question. I could get back to you with that number. We’ve ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. If it’s not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully we won’t need them. Yeah, we’ll be able to give you- We can give you a number. If it’s important, we’ll give you a number. Go ahead. When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. There’s been a tremendous amount of the way they’re working together. They’re working hand-in-hand. I think they’re doing really a great job. From that standpoint, that’s what I was referring to yesterday. Yeah, Steve, go ahead. I’m not referring to it. Meaning the- Yeah, if you’re talking about the virus, no. That’s not under control for any place in the world. I think I read- I think I read … no, I didn’t. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus.  Yes, please. Well, it may be. We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. Once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge. We’re not really. We hope we don’t have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision. I think the federal government’s doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping countries out, certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they’ve a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death. I think that we’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint.  With that being said, no matter where you look, this is something. It’s an invisible enemy. But we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people, the nurses, the doctors, they have been doing a fantastic job. We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. For the most part, they either have it or they will be getting it.  But remember this, we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally, from a local standpoint because it can go quicker, we want them to work. We had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There’s a tremendous coordination. There’s a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. That’s pretty much for the most part, bipartisan. Yeah. I don’t number one determine recession. I just say this. We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. I’ve read about it. I read about many years ago, 1917, 1918. I’ve seen all of the different problems similar to this that we’ve had. This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious, sort of a record setting-type contagion. The good part is the young people they do very well and healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. Yes, please. I’ve been watching. I don’t know. That I can’t tell you if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair. I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter. We haven’t really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won’t have to. That’s a very big step. It’s a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it. Jennifer, go. I’ve heard that’s true. I don’t know that for a fact, but I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, have been dealing with them or with him. That’s nice. We’ve had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help. I believe he was one of them.  As far as the airlines are concerned, were going to back the airlines 100%. it’s not their fault. It’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source, but it’s nobody’s fault. We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them. We’re going to be helping. We’re going to be backstopping the airlines. We’re going to be helping them very much, John. It’s very important. We’re going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It’s not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season. Everybody was. They were having record seasons. Then this came out and it came out from nowhere. Not their fault, but we’re going to be back the airline. Yeah. Best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That’s what I can do. That’s the best thing we can do. That’s what I think about. Once this virus has gone, I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody’s ever seen before. Oh, okay. Yeah. That would be the outside number. Hold on one second. Please, go ahead. I think they may make it even better. Look, they’re working together very well with the House. They are working very much in unison, like the question before. They’re working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. That’s what we’re looking to do. We may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion. Please. Let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please. Go ahead, Yes, Mike. Admiral, perhaps you could- I think the admiral can answer that and you might want to talk about the roving also. I think just to put it a different way, a lot of testing has been going on. I don’t believe anybody has been able to do what we’re doing and what we will be doing. This has never been done before. That’s never been done and certainly not on a level like that. I will say that I think I can speak for the professionals that if you don’t have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn’t think you need it, don’t get the test. Don’t get the test. I think that’s very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test, but we’re able to handle tremendous numbers of people.  John? We’re looking into it. We’ve heard that. We’ve heard it from really two places. There are two places that have specifically, New York being one. We are looking into it very strongly. Yeah.  Steve, go ahead please. I’ve always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot. Maybe, if anything, more, certainly not less. Not something I want to do every day. I can tell you that. It’s a little bit of … good doctors in the White House, but it’s a test. It’s a test. It’s a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it. I think he can do more. I think he can do more. It’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now. I think New Rochelle, a place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle.  Place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle. I think it’s a very, no I think it’s an area that has to be tamped down even more. Because it’s a hotbed. There’s no question about it. So I think they could look at doing it. But we’re getting along very well. We’ve had a very, in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. That federal government has done everything they’ve wanted us to do.  But we can, I think it’s very important that all of the governors get along very well with us. And that we get along with the governors and I think that’s happening. Well, we haven’t thought of it. But you know, I will say this, we’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me they’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested and we have to be very careful. But everybody should be very vigilant. We have to be vigilant. Yeah please. Go ahead please. Hold it, hold it. Before you. I’d rate it a ten. I think we’ve done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country despite, even the professionals saying, “No, it’s too early to do that.” We were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country. If we didn’t do that. I would rate ourselves and the professional. I think the professionals have done a fantastic job.  As far as the testing. You heard the Admiral, I think the testing that we’ve done. We really took over an obsolete system. Or put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn’t meant to do anything like this. We took it over and we’re doing something that’s never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well. We took the system, we worked with the system we had and we broke down the system purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we’re doing now. And within a short period of time and even now we’re testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately you’re saying, it will be what? It will be up to how many people will be able to test? Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the, “This has never been done before in this country.” If you look back take a look at some of the things that took place in ’09 or ’11 or whatever it may have been nobody’s ever done anything like what we’re doing. Now. I will also say Admiral, I think we can say that we’re also getting this ready for the future. So that when we have a future problem, if and when, and hopefully we don’t have anything like this. But if there is, we’re going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base. We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose and for that purpose it was fine. But not for this purpose. So we broke down the system and now we have something that’s going to be and is very special and is ready for future problems. I think we can say that very strongly. Yeah. Go ahead please. Well, I’d leave that up to the states. It’s a big thing. Postponing an election. I think to me that really goes to the heart of what we’re all about. I think postponing and elections is a very tough thing I know they’re doing, because they’ve been in touch with us, they’re doing it very carefully. They’re spreading people out at great distances as you can see. And I think they’ll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely, but I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room and a lot of the electoral places. And I think that they will do it very well, but I think postponing is unnecessary. We think about it. We think about it. If we don’t have to do it, that’ll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the Southern and the Northern borders. And we are talking about different things, but we’ll see. Right now we have not decided to do that. Steve. Go ahead please. Yeah, no the marked will take care of itself. The market will be a very strong as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes. I haven’t heard that. I haven’t heard that from Devin or anybody else. Well I have to see what they said. But- Well, I would disagree with it. But right now we don’t have an order one way or the other. We don’t have an order, but I think it’s probably better that you don’t. Especially in certain areas, Oklahoma doesn’t have a tremendous problem. You said the Governor of Oklahoma? And Devin. Yeah, well I had heard that.  I would said verse to what the professionals are saying. Yeah. I’ll take a look at it. Absolutely. Do you want to answer that? Well we haven’t said that yet. We’re recommending but- … we’re recommending things. No, we haven’t gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven’t gone there yet. Please. Well hopefully it will pas through and hopefully everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be at a fairly quick period of time. But we’re taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions, we may enhance those decisions. We’re going to find out as per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be hence. How about one more? Jennifer. Yeah. One thing Mike just said, it’s very important to get out that this is for the next, much of what we’re talking about is for the next 15 days. Mike go ahead. Just one more. Steve go ahead please. Yeah. We had a G7. It was- It looks like it. I am very confident. They’re in a position that some of them are in a rough position. If you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory. We had a very good a conference. It was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone, every leader. And almost a hundred percent was devoted to the subject that we’re talking about today. And they are working very hard and they’re very concerned obviously, but they’re working very hard. But I would say just about all of it was Steve, all of it was devoted to what we’re talking about. I think so. I mean so far it seems, we didn’t even discuss that. It’s still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion and there’s a great comradery. There’s a great togetherness. I think I can say that very, very strongly. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much everyone. Thank you. Progress being made and I appreciate you’re all joining us. Last night the FDA announced groundbreaking new policies to further increase testing, very substantially so. All states can now authorize tests developed and used within their borders in addition to the FDA. So the states are very much involved. They have been involved from the beginning, but we’re stepping it up as much as we can and the testing procedures are going well and within a short period of time, all of the private labs will kick in. This never been done before and it’s going to be something very … I think it’s going to be incredible if it’s done properly and these great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world actually. So the state is going to be dealing through themselves and with local government, local physicians, local everybody. They’re also dealing with us, but we have a tremendous testing capacity.  Today we’re also announcing a dramatic expansion of our Medicare Telehealth services. Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional costs, including with commonly used services like FaceTime and Skype, a historic breakthrough. This has not been done before either. In addition, states have the authority to recover Telehealth services for their medical patients and by doing this, the patient is not seeing the doctor per se, but they’re seeing the doctor so there’s no getting close. During this time, we will not enforce applicable HIPAA penalties so that doctors can greatly expand care for their patients using Telehealth. So the penalties won’t be enforced. We encourage everyone to maximize use of Telehealth to limit exposure to the virus. It’s been a very successful method of communication but never used on a scale like we’re going to use the Telehealth. And you’ll be able to also better maintain hospital capacity by doing this.  Earlier this morning, I spoke with executives from America’s fast food industry, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, all of the big ones, Burger King, and they were great. We were talking about the pickups in light of yesterday’s guidance. You heard to avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, or public food courts. We discussed the important role that the drive-through pickup and delivery service can play in the weeks ahead. So that’s happening and they have been fantastic. They have been absolutely fantastic and they’ve been doing it already, but they’re keeping it open and smaller staffs of very capable people and very capable companies and they’re doing it, pickups.  Our guidance yesterday urges Americans to take action for 15 days to help stem the outbreak, so it’s a 15 day period. I guess now we’d say it’s a 14 day period. It’s 15 days from yesterday and we’re asking everyone to work at home if possible, postpone unnecessary travel and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people. By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy because I think our economy will come back very rapidly. So it’s 15 days from yesterday. We’ll see what happens after that. If we do this right, our country and the world frankly, but our country can be rolling again pretty quickly, pretty quickly. We have to fight that invisible enemy that I guess unknown, but we’re getting to know it a lot better.  Today, the Senate has taken up coronavirus legislation that includes free testing for those who need it, as well as paid sick leave and family medical leave for workers affected by the virus. We’re also committed to getting small businesses the support that they need. In fact, one of the things we talked about with the fast food operations, we spoke to the chairman and CEOs of all of the companies, but one of the things we discussed is exactly that, getting small businesses’ support and flexibility that they need for themselves and for their workers and that’s being worked on right now.  At my direction, Secretary Mnuchin is meeting today with senators on additional stimulus packages. I can tell you he’s meeting with them late until the night last night and for a big part of the day yesterday and tremendous things are happening. There’s great spirit, tremendous spirit, and I can say that for Republicans and Democrats. I can say that with respect to Governor Cuomo. We had a great talk this morning. We’re both doing a really good job and we’re coordinating it and we agree. Different states need different things and we agree on that 100%, but we had a very good talk and I think we’re right down the same track and it’s going to be very successful.  New York has a pretty big problem I guess would be the number one hot spot. That’s no fault of anybody’s. It’s just the way it is. But we’re working very closely together. We’re also getting FEMA very much involved. They’ve been involved but now we’re getting them to a different level and we’ll have everything ready. We’re dealing with the Army Corps of engineers should that be necessary. We have them working in some cases, on standby in other cases, but my conversation with Andrew Cuomo was a very, very productive one and a very good one and I appreciate that.  We’re giving relief to affected industries and small businesses and we’re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to pop. One day we’ll be standing possibly up here. We’ll say, “Well, we won,” and we’re going to say that. Sure as you’re sitting there, we’re going to say that, and we’re going to win. I think we’re going to win faster than people think, I hope.  Later today, I’ll meet with the leaders from the tourism industry as well as industrial supply retailers and wholesalers to discuss their critical roles. As you know, I met with the department store people, all of the retailers, the big ones including Walmart and others, and it was great meeting. They’re stocking up their stores like they’ve never stocked them before. We’re trying to get people to actually buy less, if that’s possible. Buy less. Don’t take everything, just buy what you need for a while. They’re going to stay open all hours of the day and they’ve really been, they’ve been fantastic.  We’re taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger, frankly stronger than ever before. And we recognize that while many American workers can work from home, many others cannot. Many of our healthcare providers, first responders and men and women in the food service and manufacturing are showing that … They’re showing up and standing up to provide us with the goods and services we need. So we want people to stay home where they can, but many cases when you talk about food service and manufacturing certain items in particular, they’re going in and they’re practicing all of the safety rules and regulations that we talk about. So with that, I’d like to just introduce our great vice president, Mike Pence. He’ll say a few words and then I’ll make some other introductions. Thank you very much. I want to thank Chad Wolf and Homeland Security and the job they did at the airports was really incredible. They screened thousands and thousands of people. O’Hara got backed up a little bit, but they got them out but everybody was screened and screened very carefully. They didn’t want to rush it. I think it was 13 airports and it was an incredible thing. Then they had a big surge also from the UK and Ireland and that went very smoothly, but they did a fantastic job. They work long hours and they did a fantastic job.  I’d like to introduce Steven Mnuchin and then I’m going to ask Steve to leave because he’s going to the Hill. He’s been working very hard with the Senate and with actually with the House on a very, very big bold package. It’s going to be big and it’s going to be bold and the level again of enthusiasm to get something done, I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything quite like it. So, Steve Mnuchin, please. Do you have any questions or the Secretary of the Treasury? Please, please wait please. The airline industry will be in good shape. Yeah, go ahead please. I think I think we’re going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible. That may not be an accurate way of doing it because obviously some people shouldn’t be getting checks for $1,000 and we’ll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day what we’re going to be doing. I have to say this, there are four different ways you can do it. You can hear me well enough, I imagine. People at home; those are very important people, especially your people.  Look, we have four or five ways we can do it, four ways in particular. I think there’s a fifth possibility but there are some very good ways of getting the money out and getting it out quickly. Payroll tax is one way, but it does come over a period of months, many months and we want to do something much faster than that. So I think we have ways of getting money out pretty quickly and very accurately. We don’t want to talk about it but it’s a substantial number. We’re going big. The expression, we could do it two ways. We could keep going back every day or every week. We’re going big and that’s where Mitch McConnell, that’s the way he wants to go. That’s the way I want to go. I think we want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through a little meetings every couple of days. We don’t want to do it that way. We want to go big, go solid.  The country is very strong. We’ve never been so strong and that’s what we’re going to be doing. We don’t want with this invisible enemy, we don’t want airlines going out of business. We don’t want people losing their jobs or not having money to live when they were doing very well just four weeks ago. So we’re going big and that’s the way it’ll be and that’s the way everybody seems to like it on the Hill.  Any other questions for Steve? Thanks, Steve. And the banks are record setting strong, so we have that, which is a much different event than what we had not so long ago. John, go ahead. Yes, we’re starting to. We’re starting the process and it’s a process. We hope it’s not going to be necessary, but it could be necessary.  The state is working on it very hard themselves, but we’ll probably supplement what they’re doing. No, I don’t see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well. They have every incentive to do so. Jeff. Well, the Governor of Ohio is doing a great job. He called that off and we’ll see what happens, is a court case and it hasn’t been fully determined yet, but if he called it off I could understand that because you know he’s definitely somebody that knows what he’s doing. We’ll be seeing very soon, they’re going by the rule of 10 as opposed to 50 and it’s pretty tough. I would say probably you could violate that if you wanted to for an election.  I just think an election is a very special thing he’s going to chose. He chose a different date, I think a date sometime in June but that would be a decision that would be made by him. He felt it was necessary. The courts are, somebody challenging it, so the courts will ultimately decide. What I’m doing? Yeah. What I’m doing John’s, very simple. We’re getting rid of this virus. That’s what we’re doing. That’s the best thing we can do.  By the way, for the markets, for everything. It’s very simple, very simple solution. We want to get rid of it. We want to have very, as few deaths as possible. This is a horrible thing. You look at what’s going on with Italy. We don’t want to be in a position like that but a much larger because we’re a much larger country. We don’t want to be there and I think we’ve done really well. I think we’ve done well. I think the states have done well. We’re all working together.  The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that’s gone, it’s going to pop back like nobody’s ever seen before. That’s my opinion but I think it will pop back like nobody’s ever seen before. Please. I ordered a massive numbers of ventilators. We have by any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators. We have tremendous amounts of equipment but compared to what we’re talking about here, this has never been done before. Yesterday I gave the governors the right to go order directly if they want, if they feel they can do it faster than going through the federal government.  Now we’ve knocked out all of the bureaucracy. It’s very direct, but it’s still always faster to order directly and I gave them, that was totally misinterpreted by the New York Times on purpose unfortunately. But it’s very important. Yes, Mike. Please. The Army Corps is very prepared to do, as we say, and we’re looking at where it’s going, and they do call them MASH hospitals, but the field hospitals go up very quickly there. We have them, we have all of this equipment in stock and we’re looking at different sites in a few different locations and we’re not going to need in West Virginia where so far I guess they have none. Still none. Still none. Right. West Virginia. Big Jim, the governors, he must be doing a good job. That’s what’s reported. Well, that’s all.I just see. West Virginia is the only one that has no cases. So obviously that’s being treated differently than a New Yorker or a California; different parts of California. I do say this though. The the Army Corps of Engineers is ready, willing and able.  We have to give them the go ahead, if we find that it’s going to be necessary. We think we can have quite a few units up very rapidly. I’m going to work with Governor Cuomo. I’m going to work with a number of the governors. Governor Newsome has been very generous in his words and I’m being generous to him too because we’re all working together very well and I think a lot of very positive things have taken place.  We’re talking to California about different sites but we can, we can have a lot of units up fairly quickly if we think we need them.  I think what I’ll do is I might ask Sema to say a few words on the telehealth and then we can get back to this, please. Sema. Any questions? Will you be posting numbers also? That might be the easiest way to do it. If you post in ads, if you post some numbers. Thank you. Thank you very much. Admiral, if you’d say a few words about where we’re going. Then I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to say a couple of words, but how the system’s working? Thank you very much. Thank you, Admiral. This has never been done before. It sets a great roadmap for our future should we have something like this in the future. I hope we don’t, but it’s never been done before. They’ve done an incredible job. But again, we’re working with the states and relying on the states. We have to because it’s point of sale, its point of sight. We’re in I think just about every instance getting along really well with the states. If I could, Dr. Birx, if you could say a couple of words, please? It’s a big thing. Doctor, maybe a couple of questions? We’ve been very tough on those states. I know exactly who you’re talking about. We’ve been very tough on them. Thank you. Please, go ahead. The states are actually doing a lot of it. The governors and the states are doing a lot of it with even our tests. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please. It’s possible. It’s possible. We’ll see how it goes. There’s been great cooperation with the local governments, states. We’ll see how it goes. It’s going right now pretty well. Yeah. Please, go ahead. Go ahead. We’re able to do that if we have to. Right now we haven’t had to, but it’s certainly ready if I want it. We can do it very quickly. We’ve studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We’ll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don’t need it. It’s a big step. When you say the states- In particular, three states need some help. Some states have two people, three people, no people. In the case of, again, West Virginia. We’re looking at it very closely. We’ve taken it apart 15 different ways. It’s a very difficult thing to do. It’s a very big step. If we need that step, we’ll take it. Okay. I would just say enjoy your home, stay. I would just say right now we have to get this problem fixed and then we’ll get back into business really quick. We’ll open up our country. We’ll open up our society. The world will hopefully open up. We see areas of the world that haven’t done well. We see areas that are doing very well. I would put us in the category of doing very well for a country so big. I think that I would recommend that they just enjoy their living room.  Yeah, go ahead please. I’m not happy with those people if they’re not, but those people are being shouted down by other people. They know it. It’s almost like self-policing. People went in. There were a couple of instances, I guess, probably more than a couple of where people are not happy when they see others doing what they’re not supposed to be doing. We have to get rid of this. We have to win this war and ideally quickly, quickly. Because the longer it takes, it’s not a good situation. I’m not even talking about the economy. I’m talking about the lives of a lot of people.  Yeah, please. Did you have one? I think I’m going to ask Mike, answer that question. We’ve had so much incredible … I don’t know. It’s almost the word spirit is the best word. It’s like a spirit. The banks have come in. The banks are doing things that they would’ve never done. They’re working on extensions and lots of things that they wouldn’t have done. Copays with regard to the insurance companies, I mean for them to be doing what they’re doing. You know all about the copays. They would have never done that. They did it. They were in my office. I would say the 11 biggest in this country, I guess probably the 11 biggest of the world. The big ones, all the big ones. They did things on copay that nobody would be doing that they wouldn’t have done in a million years, but they’re doing it. There’s a great spirit going on right now in the country. You want to … yes, please. Go ahead, please. Go ahead, please. We’re looking at many ideas. That’s one of them, frankly. We’re looking at creating incentives for companies. Not only that type of company, but other companies. We’re also looking to help companies such as the airline industry, within the airline industry. We’ll be doing that. We will be doing that. This is not their fault. They’ve been very understanding actually. We’re going to be helping them. We will have a very powerful airline industry. It’ll start up as soon as this is over. We’ll have those planes ready to go. We have to help them during the short term. It’s very important.  Yeah, please. We’ve looked at every model. We’ve relied on the very talented people and there’s no better team than the people behind me. I will say that all of the people that have done those models are all in constant touch with Dr. Birx and Tony and everybody that you’ve been hearing so much from over the last couple of weeks. We’ve looked at many different models. The model we have is we want to save a lot of lives. We want to save a lot of lives. If we get too steep on that curve, you’re going to lose a lot of lives, perhaps unnecessarily.  Now we’re going to find out, everything has a risk. We’re going to see. But if people do what we’re telling them to do, what we’re asking them to do, you’re going to see the saving of a lot of lives. Now, Boris, in UK yesterday, you saw what happened. It looked like they were going a different way, but then he went away of similar, I guess similar, I don’t know exactly. But I would say we had a conversation yesterday similar to what we’re doing. A lot of people seem to think this is going to be … we are looking to save the maximum number of lives.  We are looking to save the maximum number of lives. Everything else is going to come back. A life is never going to come back, but everything else, our economy is going to come roaring back. You’re going to know. We’re going to know. We’re going to all know that day. Somebody was asking about the day. When will you know? When will you know? We’re going to know. All of a sudden we’re going to say, “Wow, that’s looking good. That’s looking good. That’s looking good.” We’re going to be on the other side of the curve, and that’s a day that we look forward to. Okay? No, I don’t think so. This is where we’re going. I really think from the beginning, this is where we were going. This is what we had in mind. We’re just going step by step. That was the next step. The next logical step as Dr. Fauci said and I think very importantly, one of the most important things when you write the history of this was the fact that we closed it down to China and Europe, but in particular China, we closed it down to China, the source very, very early, very, very early, far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. I think in the end that’s going to be, that will have saved a tremendous number of lives. I mean I have seen that where people actually liked it, but I didn’t feel different. I’ve always known this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries. I think now it’s in almost 120 countries all over the world. No, I’ve always viewed it as very series. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn’t. It could be. I mean, I don’t think in terms of recession. I think in terms of getting it out, because when we’re finished with the virus, we will win. We will win, and when that victory takes place, our economy’s going to go through the roof. It is so pent up. It is so built up. It is so ready to go in an upward direction, but we have to knock out this enemy. This is a really tough enemy, but we have to knock out, all of us. That’s all of us. I don’t think in terms of recession, not recession, it’s words. We have to knock out this and we will have an economy. I actually think we’ll have an economy like we’ve never had before. It’s all pent up. Did you have something say Mike?  Yes. In other words, reduce the number of people that die. That’s what we’re trying to do. When you do the steep curve, a lot of people are going to die. A lot of people. The worst ever, they say 1918, and I don’t have to go into the numbers, but they were unbelievable numbers. Had they known and had they done what we had now, it would’ve been a very much different story. It would still be tragic, but it would have been a very much different. But that was the one that people write about. That was an incredible pandemic like we haven’t seen, but we have done something that, I hope, hopefully we will all have made the right moves. We’re all in this together including you and we want to see fair press.  I’ll tell you what it’s been, generally speaking, I think it’s been a great thing to see. Getting along with Democrats getting along with Republicans for the Democrats themselves. There’s been a lot of spirit. There’s been a lot of things happening that I haven’t seen happen in the first almost now three and a half years. It’s been very nice to see. That’s one of the good things, but really the good thing is we have to knock it out. We have to win and we want to keep that slope as low as possible because that’s a lot of lives in there. Let’s go back there for somebody that didn’t get one, please. Go ahead. Well, they need our product very badly. No, I haven’t received any. Good relationship with China. I have not received anything to that. No, we have a signed agreement. They’re going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product.  Yeah, please. Well, I’ll know the point by speaking with Governor Cuomo and other governors, we’re going to know the points. It’s going to be different for New York then it’s going to be for Iowa or from Idaho or from West Virginia, frankly, or for any. It’s different. New York has got a big problem. The state of Washington has a big problem. California has some big problems. Everyone’s doing a good job, but we’re going to know when it will be.  I believe it’ll be more spot that it will be, it’s not going to be the whole thing. It’s going to be spots. There are some hotspots that are in trouble, big trouble, and there are other areas that are in no trouble at all. They watch it on television. They don’t know. It’s just not affecting them. They’re lucky. They’re lucky. But there are areas of the country that don’t have much of a problem and some that don’t have any problem, they’re not going to have a problem with hospitals. But some areas like New York, California, state of Washington, they’re going to have some difficulty. When we see that coming, we’re going to be in there. We’re already making preparation for it. Well, we’re looking at different things, John. I don’t want to say exactly right now. China has been sending us everything we need but we’re looking at some alternatives. Yes, we are looking for alternatives.  And we have other places. Ireland does a lot of work for us. You know that. In that world, in the pharma world. A very tremendous producer and we are looking to bring a lot more back home.  Excuse me, you know me for a long time, I’ve been talking about this for many years, long before I decided to run for president, I’ve been talking about this. We have to be able to take care of our country and that was one of the many things on the list, so we’ll be talking about it. But we are discussing it and Marco is very much involved and Peter is very much involved. A lot of people are involved. A lot of people feel that way. But we’ll be discussing. Let’s go, please. Not to the United States. Well, Canada has not closed it to the United States. We’re working very closely with Canada. But they have not closed it. They have closed it to the world, but they have not closed it to the United States. I don’t want to say that, but we are discussing things with Canada and we’re discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly. Again, the relationship is outstanding with both. Outstanding. We just signed our deal, USMCA, and the relationship is very strong.  Go ahead, please. Well, China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false. Rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. I think it’s a very accurate term. But no, I didn’t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody. No, I don’t think so. No. I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.  Please. Well, we’re going to help. They need help. Look, let’s face it. You know they go from having record-breaking years. This is the third year of record-breaking years. Travel and tourism, airlines, everything. They were doing record numbers, ordering new planes, building new hotels. Everything was really a hunky dory. Then one day we hear about this rumor in China and then we find out it’s much more than a rumor and then all of a sudden we make a great decision to close it up early. It would be a whole different world. It would be a whole different world, but we make a decision to close it up to China and all of a sudden tourism. Then we close it up to Europe, which people never heard of this before. I’m not sure that that’s ever been done. I know that when I made the decision to close it China people told me that’s never been done before, but it was a great decision.  We make good decisions. I’ll tell you my best decision. The people behind me are total pros. All over the world, they’re respected. Dr. Burks, Anthony, who’s become a … Where’s Anthony. He’s become a major television star for all the right reasons. No, he’s just so professional, so good. The people that we have working here have been incredible. They’re totally respected.  The admiral has been incredible having to do with the testing. Incredible. He’s viewing this as testing also for the future. We’re building a platform. When we took over this platform, first thing the admiral said was “This was not designed for what we’re talking about. Millions of people.” It wasn’t.  It’s nobody’s fault. It’s not like who could have ever predicted a thing like this? But we broke it down and it’s really going to be an incredible system. It is now a great system.  I just want to say these are incredible people standing behind me. They’re the most respected in the world. Every country that you’ve mentioned today so far has called them and they call them all the time for advice. There’s nobody better than what we have. I don’t know. I can’t imagine. I can tell you he’s doing a good job. We’re very happy with him.  Please, you have it. Go ahead. Right. It wasn’t about the payroll tax. Well, I didn’t make a change. We’re looking at payroll tax and we’re looking at various other forms of getting money to people. The payroll tax is something that I’ve always liked. The problem is, it does take a period of time, months before they really see something. We don’t really have months in terms of people living. You have people that work on tips. It’s a large number of people. Who would think this, right? And they do nicely. They work very hard, but they work on tips. We have to take care of our people. We don’t want to have people suffering during this period. It wasn’t their fault that this thing all of a sudden was upon us. We’re looking at various, we’re also looking at payroll tax. It’s possible. It’s also possible we’ll do a percentage of payroll tax and then other things. But we’d like to be able to get money to people. We’re very lucky. Our country’s doing so well. We can do this and we can do it easily, but we have to do it. I have to say Mitch McConnell, if you look at Mitch and Kevin and the whole group and it’s been incredible how they’re reacting, how Congress is reacting, whether it’s the House or Senate, how they’re moving. I’m talking about Democrats and Republicans, but we’ve had a tremendous leadership meetings and they want to see it done right, and they do want to go big.  I think going big is important. I don’t think we want to go up there every day with a different idea, a different concept. Oh gee, let’s worry about the airlines. Let’s do this one. You have a big problem with the cruise ship industry. It’s an industry that we’re setting all sorts of records two months ago. Then all of a sudden there’s nobody on the ships. Okay? We have to help these. These are great industry. These are going to be taking care of people and passengers and for years to come and paying tremendous taxes, tremendous taxes for years to come. We have to make sure that this is done.  Yes, John? I only do that when I have to respond. I watched her on television. She said something that was false and therefore I did do that and I will continue to do that. If they’re not going to play fair because you know they have the media on their side. I don’t. I just have me. If they’re not going to play fair, I’m going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there’s going to be nobody. There’s going to be nobody better than Donald Trump in terms of a bipartisanship. But if they’re going to say things that are false, like the story that was written yesterday. A lot of people, I don’t know somebody, I think I know who, but they taped the conference call that I had with the governors. It was a good call. It was fine. I assume somebody’s going to tape it. They handed it to various people and one of them was the New York Times and the New York Times chose to write totally inaccurately about it. It was a disgraceful thing. It was bad journalism, but they do a lot of bad journalism. But we respond to that, and actually people get it. People get it. No, I want it to be bipartisan and nobody’s going to be better than me, but when they attack me or the people, these incredible people behind me, I’m not going to let them get away with that. I can’t do that.  Okay. How about one or two more questions? Go ahead, please. Please. Well, you can do a national lockdown. Hopefully, we’re not going to need that. We think of everything. I mean we have every idea that you mentioned we’ve thought of. It’s a very big step. That’s a step that, I mean in one sense it would work. It’s a very big step. It’s something we talk about, but we haven’t decided to do that. Please, go ahead. I just don’t think it’s going to be an action that we’re going to take. I don’t think I’ll talk, but Anthony, all of the people standing behind me, we’d get together in a room plus some additionals and we would make a decision, but I don’t think that’s a step that we’re going to be taking.  One more question. You didn’t have one, did you? Come on. We’re looking at that. We’re certainly looking at Boeing. Boeing got hit hard in many different ways. Boeing never had a problem for years. It was unthinkable what happened with respect to Boeing. Unthinkable. Probably I would consider it the greatest company in the world prior to a year ago. Now they get hit in 15 different ways and they have different management. I’ve met the new people running Boeing. I think it’s going to be outstanding. But yeah, we have to protect Boeing. We have to absolutely help Boeing. They were doing a job. It was coming along well and then all of a sudden this hits. Obviously, when the airlines aren’t doing well, Boeing’s not going to be doing well, so we’ll helping Boeing. Yeah. That’s what I heard. I’m going to let Tony answer that question or whoever’s best at answering that. But I do have to say, when you talk about politics, I watched the debate, not too exciting, but what they said about me, and we’ve done a great job when you talk about not being bipartisan, what they said about me. If you look at a swine flu, the whole thing in I guess it was 2009 and what they did and the mistakes they’ve made, they were terrible. They were horrific mistakes. 17,000 people died. I’ll be honest, they shouldn’t be criticizing because we’ve done a fantastic job.  The only thing we haven’t done well is to get good press. We’ve done a fantastic job, but it hasn’t been appreciated. Even the closing down of the borders, which had never been done, and not only did we close them, but we’d close them early. The press doesn’t like writing about it. We’ve done a poor job on press relationships. I guess I don’t know who to blame for that. I don’t know. Maybe I can blame ourselves for that? I will blame ourselves. But I think we’ve done a great job. I think we’ve done a poor job in terms of press relationship. But let me have somebody answer your question. Please. Good answer. That’s a good answer. Would you have something on that? That’s what I heard too. Number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful. Listen, thank you very much. No, he made a mistake. I assume that he’ll apologize for that mistake. Thank you all very much. We’ll be back."
"Well, thank you very much. We have the tourism industry executives, the biggest anywhere in the world. These are the great ones, and they’re going to say a couple of little words pretty soon, I think, we’ll talk about their company quickly and the number of employees, and what’s happened since the Chinese virus came about, and they’ll be discussing that. So we’re join this afternoon by the true leaders of our nation’s travel, hospitality and tourism industries, and I want to thank you all for being here. I’ve known many of you for a long time. Great people. I want to thank vice president Pence for his tremendous leadership on the task force. He’s done a great job, and thanks also to secretary Mnuchin over at the Hill. They’ve been working and Wilbur Ross, and everybody basically, they’re all working. We’re all working very hard. We’re profoundly grateful to all of the companies and organizations here today representing tens of thousands of American workers, and really representing something so important.  It’s a place to stay when they come to our country. Such a big business. One of the biggest businesses. And thank you for adopting additional protocols to keep Americans healthy, including enhanced cleaning processes throughout your hotels and buildings. We know that your industry is among the hardest hit by the economic impact of the virus. Our goal is to beat the virus, and we will, we call it the hidden virus, the hidden enemy, with aggressive action now, so that we can rebound stronger than ever before, and that’s what we’re doing. And everyone’s cooperating. We’re really getting tremendous spirit, the Republicans are getting along with Democrats, and a lot of good things are happening. Yesterday we issued new guidelines for how all Americans can minimize their risk of exposure, and stop the transmission of the virus. My administration has taken decisive action to support American workers, and businesses. We love our workers. We love those workers. They’re incredible. And we’re going to come out stronger than ever before, and it’s not going to be so long. The IRS will defer tax payments for effected individuals and businesses.  Today, the Senate has taken up legislation to provide for free testing, and that’ll happen, paid sick and family medical leave and nutritional assistance for the vulnerable, we’re announcing, and we will be announcing again later on, that we’re working with Congress to provide rapid relief for affected workers in industries. And this will allow us to emerge from the strongest economy on earth, because we had literally the strongest economy on earth. And now this is in, as of last count, over 124 countries, I understand. 124 countries, unbelievable. But we’ll emerge, I really believe we’ll emerge stronger, because we’ll be doing things differently than this country’s done them in the past for many, many decades. And we’re deeply committed to ensuring that small businesses have the support they require, the Small Business Administration announced disaster loans, which provide impacted businesses with up to $2 million. And we’ve asked Congress to increase the SBA lending authority. We’re going to be going up to 50 billion, and actually much more than that for small businesses. So there’ll be help. In your cases, they’re very big businesses, but it’s a lot of employees, and so we appreciate it very much.  We appreciate your being here, and maybe in front of the media, you could say a couple of words about your companies, and the number of people that you employ. I pretty much know every one of you in that respect. It’s a lot of people, and they’re great companies. Please. And tell me, so you’re in many countries, and how are you doing in other countries? Some are in very, very bad shape. And that’s pretty much all over the world. Well, we’ll get it open soon and we’re doing a Yeoman’s effort. I think we’re going to be very successful. You’ll be back in business soon. But we have to keep your employees going. And the businesses going. And we will be able to do that, Chris, thank you. But all over the world it’s a disaster. Yep. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you very much. With the banks. Yeah. We’re dealing with the banks too. The banks have been very accommodating. They will be. I think they will be. Thank you David. Appreciate it. Please. How many hotel rooms now, worldwide? And this all started in China. That’s where you first saw the problem, and it’s where you first got hit. Hope you all heard that. Is China doing better now? 2%. In Macau? So that means it’s coming. We’re in the process. We haven’t hit that top yet, we’re in the process. Thank you Arne. Thank you. Yep, we will. Okay, give us those suggestions. Yeah. To what? Okay. So it’s individual properties instead of accumulated primaries. Okay, I got it. Thank you very much. Thank you Patrick. You have some of the sports leagues right? You have quite a few. Yeah, I would think so. When this ends, do you see a quick buildup? Hopefully you can retain them. That’s what we’re shooting for. You want to retain them. What kind of a fund would that be? In terms of dollars. I got it. I think so too. I think so too. Thank you very much. Hi Jim. We couldn’t get you a chair? What happened? I think so. Okay, we’ll get it done here. We’ll get it done. Is that what you like the best of the various scenarios? Most direct, not as quick, but most direct. Thank you. Let me ask you, the parks outside of the United States- Closed? You closed all of the parks, everything. Closed. That’s a real worldwide problem, isn’t it? That’s incredible. You guys okay? Yes, please. But they’ll come back as we age a little bit, right? Yeah, I think so. May come back fast. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you all very much. Thank you. Please. That’s all being figured now, and we’re also helping industries like Boeing, we have to help Boeing, we have to help the airline industry. It wasn’t their fault. This wasn’t their fault, and we will do that. We’ll be doing that. So we’re adding it up. It’ll be fine. It’ll come back very quickly once we’re finished with our war with the virus. They’ve done it in smaller amounts, yeah. Well, it can definitely afford it. The question is, do we want to go through payroll, and do what we want to do. There are four other ways of doing it, and that’s what we’re determining, along with the Senate right now. Senate and House, we’re all working on this together. Thank you all very much. Well, the message is that this was something that happened. It’s nobody’s fault. It happened. And we’re going to take care of it. We’ll be bigger, stronger, better than ever before, and it won’t take that long. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus. We’ll be invoking the defense production act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while. Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it. It’s prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act. Last week I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which is we invoked previously and which activated FEMA National Response Coordination Center, FEMA is fully engaged at the highest levels.  Today FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level which we will work with and we’ve been working with FEMA. I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA. They’re incredible. It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes. There right now in Tennessee, a large group working in Tennessee have been incredible. It was tragic event Alabama last year, also a tornado and then obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were in some cases very devastating and in every case FEMA came through. This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do.  We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA. We’re sending upon request the two hospital ships, they’re being prepared right now. They’re massive ships. They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called The Mercy and the other is called The Comfort and they are in tiptop shape. They soon will be. They’re getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with governor Cuomo about it. He’s excited about it. We haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West coast. The Comfort is located now in San Diego and it’s going to be… We’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly, so those two ships are being prepared to go and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need.  Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington state, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January, but thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. It’s a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this and now we did it just in a very short while. That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine and making very, very big progress.  Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We’re working with several groups to determine if the self swab a much easier process than the current process. That’s a not very nice to do. I can tell you because I did it. But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult. If you haven’t done. The groups are working on determining if a self swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The others very effective, very accurate but we’re going to see if we can do a self swab which would be a lot more popular. I can tell you that. So and that would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do. The fact is that the health professionals would… It would free up a lot. Let me just say the self swab is what it is. It’s a self swab. You do it yourself.  The other has to be issued by a health professional and it’s something that is quite difficult and we think it’s working out for the self swab. If it would test positive that people would go and they would do what they have to do, but we think that’s probably working out. I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things and I’m going to be holding the second news conference either today. We’re going to talk about the FDA. Some things are happening that are quite exciting and we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow, fairly early tomorrow. So we’ll see what happens. But the FDA, my instructions is I’ve been working very, very hard on a number of developments and we’ll be discussing that with you later today or tomorrow.  This afternoon I’ll be meeting with nurses on the front lines of the battle against the virus. They’re truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They’re incredible people. So we’re going to be meeting with nurses and I actually look forward to that. Very brave. They’re taking a lot of risk and they have done an incredible job and they never complain.  Today I’m also announcing that the department of housing and urban development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD. Every generation of American has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.  In World War II young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight. They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refuse to go home and slept in factory floors to keep assembly lines running. The numbers of ships that they built during World War II to this day has never… Nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships literally on a daily basis. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it and to this day nobody seen anything like that. What they were able to do during World War II and now it’s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.  We are all in this together and we’ll come through together. It’s the invisible enemy. That’s always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we are going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought and it will be a complete victory. It’ll be a total victory.  So we’ll have a second conference, again having to do with the FDA on this. I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference and we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow. And I’ll, with that, ask, Mike Pence to say a few words and thank you very much. Thank you very much. Dr. Birks, please. Thank you, Deborah, very much. Mark, please. Thank you very much, Mark. Seema, please. Thank you very much. Robert, please. Thank you very much, Robert. Thank you. Thank you, all. That’s very nice. Any questions, please? Go. No. Well, I don’t agree with that. Yeah. No, I don’t agree. That’s a absolute total worst case scenario. But no, we don’t look at that at all. We’re nowhere near it. Because it comes from China. It’s not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate. Yeah, please, John. I have great love for all of the people from our country. But as you know, China tried to say at one point, maybe they’ve stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I’m president. It comes from China. John, please. Yes. Yep. We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there has never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it’s not enough. That would be the case. It’s being signed. It’s essentially drawn and I’m going to sign it in just a little while. If we need to use it, we’ll be using it at full speed ahead. Well, we’re going to know whether or not urgent, but we will… Yeah, we do have targets. We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks, you know, the masks, the numbers of masks are incredible. We’ve ordered millions of them, but we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested. We’ve never had to even think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered. We need respirators. We need, ventilators is a big thing because it’s a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we’re going to be ordering more. To be determined. We’re working with the Senate right now. We’re working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There has been tremendous… There really has been. I mean, with some exceptions obviously because it’s always the way it is. They have been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It’s a nice thing, very bipartisan, and so forth. Well, we’re going to see. I don’t want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We’re looking at timing. That would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments. We’re looking at a lot of different things. It hasn’t been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined and people want to go big as opposed… Everybody seems to want to go big and they want to get to the recovery. The big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible, I call it the unseen, the unseen enemy, you call it. There is a thousand different terms for it. It snuck up on us. It did 128 countries, I think. It’s in something like that, very close to that. Think of that, so it spreads violently. It’s a very contagious, very, very contagious virus. I do. I actually do. I’m looking at it that way because, you know, if it got out of control. The big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. It was a very good move and it was very early, very, very early when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn’t want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives. And yeah, I look at it. I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that’s what we’re fighting. It’s a very tough situation. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And then one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But, we’re doing it and we’re doing it well. And I’ll tell you, the American people have been incredible, for the most part, they’ve been really incredible. Yeah, please, . Sure. Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too. And when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn’t be doing testing and they decided to do it, very, very hard to ramp up. Now, we’re getting highly sophisticated tests and it’s going very well. But, nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you’re talking about. Well, we knew. It depends. It depends on how it goes. Worst case, absolutely, a best case, not at all, so we’re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they’re complex. You know, these are complex machines. But, we’re ordering them. Does anybody have a, Mike maybe you do, how many do we have? Please. Yeah, please. Do you know the number? We can give you that exact number. We’ll give it to you. But we’re ordering a lot more. Yeah, go ahead in the back, yes. Yeah, one second. One second, Kaitlin. We’ll do it in a second. You’ll be able to do it. Yes. No, I said not yet. I spoke with the prime minister, Trudeau, a very good relationship obviously between us and our two countries and no tipping point. It’s just that we want to isolate from the standpoint we don’t want people coming into contact because that’s the way we’re going to win this war. That is so important and we both thought it was time.  Now it’s not affecting trade. It’s non-essential. It’s non-essential crossings. It won’t affect trade at all. And it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please. . Go ahead, please. Well, they’re doing it in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. It’s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries. Yeah, please. It could be. It could be. And we’re also playing with a lot of numbers, a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers, frankly. We want to take care, we have to help everybody. It was nobody’s fault this happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody’s fault actually, but it was nobody’s fault. And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers in planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened. But I will say that, they can’t be blamed for this. And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it’s, there is going to be a comeback very, very quickly as soon as this is solved. And it will be solved. We will win. And there will be a comeback and it’ll take place very quickly. Well, I don’t want to say that because it’s a moving… Every number that you mentioned, yes, we’ve talked about those numbers. We’re also moving those numbers in both directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast.  What directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast. Again, there’s a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven’t really seen before to this extent. No. They’re looking at it. It’s down the line, and they’re looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing, because the others, to use a nice word, it’s very inconvenient. It’s very tough. Well, I think we’re doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word calm, calm doesn’t mean that I’m not taking it seriously, and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm. But yeah, 95% within the Republican party and over 50%, and, also, we have very great approval numbers. People like the job that we’re doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country, and you look at what’s happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally.  We have the greatest professionals in the world. We’re doing a good job. Nobody’s ever been swamped like this, and nothing’s been so contagious. The level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody’s seen anything quite like this.  Yeah, Peter, go ahead. I’ll let Mike answer that. You’d have to ask them that question. No, I wouldn’t say so, but perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly. Look, we inherited a very- Excuse me, excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we’re talking about. Millions and millions of people. If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn’t test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better. Hopefully they got better. That was it. Now all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing.  What we’ve done is we broke it down. We broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn’t meant to handle the kind of volume that you’re talking about. We’ve rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route. But this was never done before, and I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we built it into a very good system by using private companies, the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They’re doing a lot of work, a very good job.  But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.  John? Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check. I know, I’m sure of free trade… Look, China’s paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there’s no reason to do that. They haven’t even spoken to me about that. China hasn’t asked me to do that, but we’re getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China, and I can’t imagine Americans asking for that. But it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We’ll see what happens. China’s having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years as I understand it. They’re having a very, very tough time. And then on top of it, this happened with the virus.  But no, we’re taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs. The answer is yes. Very soon. Probably today, yes. Well, I think essential is medical. We have military working together. We have industry working together. And again, it’s not affecting trade. So things like that, but just leisurely, let’s go to a restaurant and have dinner, which a lot of people do. They come both ways. They go in both directions, that kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis. Yeah, please go ahead. Not close it. No, we’re not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do.  Please. Yeah, go ahead. You know what? Go ahead. Sure.  Doctor. Go ahead. No, I haven’t seen the article. We are making a lot of progress therapeutically. I will say that, but I have not seen that article, no.  Go ahead. There were certain industries that people know. The airlines would be number one if you look at what’s going on. They go from having the best year they’ve ever had to having no passengers because of what we’ve had to do in order to win this war. It’s a war, and so basically, you know what many of the industries are. What we want to do is we want to make sure they all stay together so that after the war is won, we can immediately go right back up to where we were and even beyond. I think we’re going to go beyond where we were, and a lot of people are saying that by the way. We’re poised to do that, but we have to win the war first.  Yeah, please go ahead. We’re talking about all of it. Haven’t detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we’re coming up with numbers. Haven’t gotten there yet, but certainly hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines. Those are all prime candidates. Absolutely. Which border? I would say 30 days, and hopefully at the end of 30 days, we’ll be in great shape.  Jeff, please. Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm. I do want people to be calm, because we’re going to win this. And we’re going to win it, it’s just a question of time ,and I want it to go quickly. So based on the fact that I want it to go quickly, I hope they just listened to what we’ve been saying over the last period of time. We don’t want them gathering. And I see they do gather, including on beaches and including in restaurants, young people. They don’t realize. They are feeling invincible. I don’t know if you felt invincible when you were very young, but they were feeling totally invincible, or are feeling that way, but they don’t realize that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents. So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice, and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through.  Jim, please. If they’re what? Well I think I just said it. Heed the advice. I just said. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Peter. Not think. No, no, I don’t think, I know where it came from. I don’t know if you’d say China’s to blame. Certainly, we didn’t get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier, but it comes from China, and it’s not a question about that. Nobody’s questioning that. Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he’s been saying. And there are those people that say that. So we’ll see what happens. Thank you.  .  It’s your turn. Go ahead.  .  Please. He’s been waiting a long time, please. You’ve had your hand up so nicely for a long. It’s your time. Yeah, I’m not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don’t like seeing that at all. I’m not happy about that at all.  Yes, please. No, I don’t believe they’re inflicting. I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice, absolutely. Please. Who are you asking of that question, because I see that they’re very high. If you look, I’m 95% of the Republican party. We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group. We’re beating sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida, the state of Florida, and in other states. So I don’t really know who you’re talking about.  Jennifer, go ahead, please. Please. I did, and they explained to me where they’re coming from. They went from, as I said, full planes packed, the best year they’ve ever had by far to, boom, one day empty because of what we have to do to win this war, or we would have a level of death like people haven’t seen before. So they’ve been fantastic. They’ve been great, but they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help, and we’ll help them, Jennifer. It’s going. There’s a lot of influx to those loans, as you could imagine. A lot of people are looking at it, but we’re going to be increasing funding a lot, and they’re very well prepared to do what they have to do. And the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator.  John? , go ahead. Go ahead in the back, please. Go ahead, please. No, we’re not seeing that at all. I wonder who said that. You know who said that? Say the term again. No. No, no. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree.  How about last question, please? Please, go ahead. My message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them. We’re with them and we will not let them down. Thank you all very much."
"Thank you very much. I think this is going to be a very important conference and I’ll get to that toward the middle, but I have a few things to report and a want to thank you all for being here and I have to say I think with social distancing that the media has been much nicer. I don’t know what it is. All these empty, these in-between chairs … You probably shouldn’t have anybody sitting behind you either. You should probably go back, but I love it. It’s so much nicer, but I shouldn’t say that because you’ll get me now. Thank you all for being here, and we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus. Before I begin, I want to start by announcing that today we are bringing home another American citizen. It was a big thing, very big. Amer Fakhoury is on his way back to the United States after being imprisoned in Lebanon since September of 2019. He’s battling late stage cancer.  Mr. Fakhoury will now be able to receive the much needed care and treatment in the United States. We’ve been working very hard to get him freed, and he’s finally able to have his entire family at his side, so I’m very grateful to the Lebanese government. They worked with us and we are very proud of his family. They stood by him so strongly and they are thrilled. The United States has no higher priority than the safety and wellbeing of our citizens. We’ve gotten a tremendous number of hostages out, as you know. I think we’re 42 and O, and Robert O’Brien, as you know, was our chief negotiator for a large part of it. In fact, did so well that now we have him in a different position. So I want to thank and congratulate Robert and his team and I want to let everyone know that recovering Americans held captive and imprisoned abroad continues to be a top priority for my administration. We have one young gentlemen, Austin Tice, and we’re working very hard with Syria to get him out. We hope the Syrian government will do that, and we are counting on them to do that. We’ve written a letter just recently that he’s been there for a long time and was captured long ago. Austin Tice, his mother’s probably watching, and she’s a great lady and we’re doing the best we can. So Syria, please work with us and we would appreciate you letting him out. If you think about what we’ve done, we’ve gotten rid of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. We’ve done a lot for Syria. We have to see if they’re going to do this. So it would be very much appreciated if they would let Austin Tice out immediately. As you know, my administration is working every day to protect American people and the American economy from the virus. Yesterday I signed into law a critical support for American workers, families and small businesses.  It’s a big thing. We’re providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus, and more help is on the way as we speak. Our entire team headed by Secretary Mnuchin is on the Hill. We’re working with Democrats and Republicans and there’s a lot of good will going on. This was something that happened that was … Some people would say an act of God. I don’t view it as an act of God. I would view it as something that just surprised the whole world. And if people would’ve known about it could have been stopped in place. It could have been stopped where it came from, China. If we would have known about it, if they would have known about it, but now the whole world almost is inflicted with this horrible … With this horrible virus, and it’s too bad … It’s too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago, but we’ll be back and I actually think we’ll be back stronger than ever before, because we learned a lot during this period of time.  I also just invoked the Defense Production Act to help facilitate distribution of essential supplies if necessary. We’re working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest hit industries. We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on so that when we recover all of these companies and these great businesses, both very, very small and very, very large, they’re not going to be broken up and you’d have to put them back together. That would take a long time because we really believe in … I believe in the V curve. I believe it’s going to go … When this is defeated, this hidden scourge is defeated, I think we’re going to go up very rapidly our economy and get back to where it was and beyond. Today, I want to share with you exciting progress that the FDA is making with the private sector as we slash red tape like nobody has ever done it before.  Somebody was on yesterday, on one of the networks and said that there’s never been a president at even close that’s been able to do what I’ve done in slashing all of the red tape and everything to get very important things to the market medical. So we slashed red tape to develop vaccines and therapies as fast as it can possibly be done, long before anybody else was even thinking about doing this. And as you know, earlier this week we began the first clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for the virus, and that was launched in record time. It was just a few weeks, and that would have taken years to do not so long ago. As we race to develop a vaccine, we’re also pursuing antiviral therapies and that’s what really we’re going to be talking to you about today. That’s the purpose of being up here today, and to me that’s even more important.  Vaccine by its nature, you have to have long tests because you have to make sure what goes into somebody’s body is not going to do destruction, do bad things. So you need long tests, and they’re doing great with the vaccines, but it’s still a long process. But the therapies and something we can move on much faster potentially. And the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms and make people better. Essentially we’re looking at things to make people better or at the very earliest stages, they wouldn’t even know they had it. And that’s where I believe it’s going to work even the best. The FDA commissioner, Steven Hahn, who’s with us, he’s fantastic, and he has been working 24 hours a day. He’s been … He’s worked probably as hard or harder than anybody in the group, other than maybe Mike Pence or me.  What the FDA is doing is incredible. They’ve done things in times that were not even thinkable. And I’ve directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and I mean fast. And we have to remove every barrier. There were a lot of barriers that were unnecessary, and they’ve done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments, and we think we have some good answers. We’ll find out very, very soon. Clinical trials are already underway for many new therapies and we’re working on scaling these to allow many more Americans to access different drugs that have shown really good promise. We’ve had some really good promise. We will do so in a way that lets us continue to collect good data, to know which medicines are safe, and which medicines are working the best. We have a couple that we’re in really good shape on, and that’s for immediate delivery, immediate. Like as fast as we can get it.  The FDA has also approved compassionate use for a significant number of patients. You know what that means. We’re also reviewing drugs that are approved abroad or drugs approved here for other uses. And one of the things that I’m most proud of that I got was right to try. That’s where somebody who’s ill, somebody who’s very sick, terminally ill, usually. In past administrations, we signed this a year and a half ago, you wouldn’t be able to even think about getting any of the drugs that may be showing great promise now. And they’ve been trying for many decades to get this approved. And it sounds simple, but it’s not because there’s liability involved and lots of other things. And I was able to get it approved, working with Congress, right to try. This is beyond right to try. What we’re talking about today is beyond right to try. Right to try has been, by the way, a tremendous success.  People are living now that had no chance of living where we take treatments that would … Things that would have to go through years of a process. And if somebody was terminally ill and I would say, “Why wouldn’t they be able to try this?” They’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe, they’d go all over the world to try and find something. Or some people, if they had no money, would go home to die. They’d go home to die. They had no hope. Right to try has been an incredible success, but this is beyond right to try. If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan or other nations are effective against a virus, we’ll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people. Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any Avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus. Now, a drug called chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxy, hydroxychloroquine, so chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.  Now, this is a common malaria drug. It’s also a drug used for strong arthritis. Somebody who has pretty serious arthritis also uses this in a somewhat different form, but it is known as a malaria drug and it’s been around for a long time and it’s very powerful. But the nice part is it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it … If things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody. When you go with a brand new drug, you don’t know that that’s going to happen. You have to see and you have to go long test. But this has been used in different forms, very powerful drug in different forms and it’s shown very encouraging, very, very encouraging early results, and we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that’s where the FDA has been so great. They’ve gone through the approval process, it’s been approved, and they did it. They took it down from many, many months to immediate.  So we’re going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states … I spoke with governor Cuomo about it at great length last night and he wants to be right on … He wants to be first on the line. And so I think that’s a tremendous … There’s tremendous promise based on the results and other tests. There’s tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that and it was approved very, very quickly and it’s now approved by prescription. Individual states will handle it, they can handle it, doctors will handle it. And I think it’s going to be great. Then we’re quickly studying this drug and while we’re continuing to study it, but the studying is going to be also done in … As it’s given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places.  We’ll study it there. There are promising therapies produced by Gilead, and that’s remdesivir, remdesivir, and that’s a drug used for other purposes that’s been out, and it’s had very good results for other purposes, but it seems to have a very good result having to do with this virus, and that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA, and I can’t tell you how much we appreciate what the FDA, these people are incredible patriots and the job that Stephen Hahn is doing, Dr. Hahn, who’s one of the most respected doctors in the country by the way, where we took him … I said, “You sure you want to do this?” Now we didn’t know that this was going to be in the playlist of what happened here. But he really has stepped up to the plate, wherever you are.  Where is he? You really have. I’d shake his hand, but I’m not supposed to do that. Get in a lot of trouble if I did that, but he’s been fantastic and I thank you doctor. He’s going to speak right after I’m finished. So Regeneron, again, is a company that’s done fantastically well as I understand with Ebola and some other things, great company and they’re looking at some very promising events also. So you have remdesivir and you have a hydroxychloroquine. So those are two that are out now, essentially approved for prescribed use. And I think it’s going to be very exciting. I think it could be a game changer, and maybe not and maybe not, but I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful. They’re very powerful.  So I want every American to know that we’re doing everything we can and these actions are important next steps. I mean, for the FDA to act the way they acted with this kind of speed is an incredible thing. Normally they’d say, “Well, we can have it by next year or we can have it by in two years from now.” You understand, this is the way. Normally it’s like years and years and years, they had it immediately. Based on the fact that it’s been used for other things. Totally unrelated things. We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans. We really hope that’s going to be, this could be a tremendous breakthrough, tremendous breakthrough, and we will work toward a much needed vaccine in the future, as I said, and what we’re doing with the FDA is so exciting and so many other fields, so many things are happening.  It’s a very exciting time for medicine, and we appreciate that the American public has pulled together, they’re really staying home and I think there’s tremendous spirit in this country right now. It’s spirit like a lot of people have not seen. People have not seen anything like it for a long time. And that means Democrat, Republican, they’re pulling together. I hope everything’s going good on the hill. Maybe I shouldn’t say this until I check out what’s going on, because you never know. But I think there’s a great spirit where the Democrats, the Republicans and everybody else, they’re getting together, they’re trying to get things done. But most importantly, the American public has been incredible. We took the best economy we’ve ever had and we said, “Stop. You can’t work. You have to stay home.” There’s never been a case like this. Normally you pay a lot of money to get things going.  Here’s a case where we’re paying a lot of money to stop things because we don’t want people to be together so that this virus doesn’t continue onward. So there’s never been anything like this in history. There’s never been it, nobody’s ever seen anything like this. But we’re doing the right thing, we have to get rid of, and our big war, it’s not a financial war, it’s a war … It’s a medical war. We have to win this war. It’s very important. With that, I’d like to just introduce Dr. Steven Hahn and he, again, I’d like to send back with Steven our thanks to all of the people working in the FDA who are fantastic, talented people. We appreciate it very much. Everything you’ve done, especially the speed that you got, these two elements, these two very important drugs passed. Thank you very much. Thank you, doctor. Thank you very much. Mike, talk about the masks. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Doctor, please. Thank you, doctor, very much. Jerome, please. Thank you, Jerome. Yeah, please. Go ahead, John. Well, we don’t want that. In fact, some companies, as you know, did stock buy backs and I was never happy with that. It’s very hard to tell them not to, but I would tell them not to. I would say, I don’t like it for that reason. Some did and it turned out that they could have waited a long time and it would have been much better off if they didn’t. We can. We can. I mean, it takes many, many people in this case to tango. But as far as I’m concerned, that conditions like that would be okay with me. John. Yeah. No, because we hope we’re not going to need that. First of all, governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work and they are doing a lot of this work. The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. We’re not a shipping clerk. The governors are supposed to be, as with testing, the governors are supposed to be doing it. We’ll help out and we’ll help out wherever we can. And we can buy in volume and in some cases, great volume with the masks as an example, which were really a problem. We have helped out and they’re right now millions of masks being made. But, this is really for the local governments, the governors and people within the state depending on the way they divided it up. And they’ll do that, and they’re doing a very good job of it.  Where you have a problem with ventilators, we’re working very hard trying to find… Nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we’d need tens of thousands of ventilators. This is something that’s very unique to this, to what happened. Well, if we were desperately in need of something and we, frankly will know about that very shortly, we want to be ahead of it. We don’t want to do it as it happens, but before it happens. We’re going to know a lot over the next two or three days. We’ll know a lot. No, I’m not, but we’re trying to find that out. This has been going on for years. Many years they’ve been trying to find Austin Tice. He was in Syria, as you know. His mother is an incredible woman and I’m doing it for him, but I’m doing it for his mother. His mother is an incredible woman who is desperate to find her son. And I’m not confirming a lot, but if he is alive, we would like very much to get him back quickly. Well, I haven’t seen that, but I will let Mike answer that question. Vice President. How many masks are being made and when will they be ready, or at least we start getting them ready? Some of that had to do with the liability in the company. They had a big problem with liability and much of it had to do with the liability to the company. We’re looking at that issue directly with them. And that’s a separate issue, but we’re looking at that issue very directly. Well, we’re going to do our best on it, but we’re working with Democrats and Republicans on that. We’re looking at that very specifically. Yeah. I hope very soon. We’ll see. This is uncharted territory, as you know. We think we have ideas and does it help to say what the idea are? I would hope very soon. We’ve pulled together as a nation. People are, for the most part, doing what they’re supposed to be doing. The social distancing is very interesting. A whole new term that’s become a hot, it’s become somewhat of a hot term, but people are listening and they’re really doing a great job. This country is an amazing country. I think you’re up to 141 different countries right now, so it’s very uncharted territory.  It could have been stopped. It could have been stopped pretty easily if we had known, if everybody had known about it a number of months before people started reading about it. Excuse me, excuse me. Before we started reading about it, we could have, it could have been stopped in its tracks. Unfortunately, they didn’t decide to make it public, but the whole world is suffering because of it. We were very prepared. The only thing we weren’t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly. I’ll tell you how prepared I was, I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was… In fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was many of the people in the room, they call me racist and other words because I did that because I went so early. So when you say we weren’t prepared, had I let these tens of thousands of people come in from China a day, we would have had something right now that would have been, you wouldn’t have even recognized it compared to where we are.  How many people have passed away? How many people have died as of this moment? You could multiply that by a factor of many, many, many. So when you say that I wasn’t prepared, I was the first one to do the ban. Now other countries are following what I did, but the media doesn’t acknowledge that. They know it’s true. They know it’s true, but they don’t want to write about it. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Sure. Governors are supposed to get it. The States are supposed to get it. But we’re helping the States. Well. Look, for years they bought them and now all of a sudden they’re coming to- … the federal government. We’re working with the States. We’re working with the governors. We’re working with everybody. The relationships are great. One of the things that happened this morning, I spoke with Micky Arison of Carnival Cruise Lines and he’s going to make ships available. So in addition to the big medical ships that you have coming, if we should need ships with lots of rooms, they’ll be docked at New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco and different places. So I want to thank Micky Arison, and that’s Carnival Cruise Line. I’ve done it. Yeah. If we find that we need something that we will do that. And you don’t know what we’ve done. You don’t know whether or not we’ve ordered. You don’t know if we’ve invoked it. You don’t know what’s been ordered and what’s not been ordered. I can only tell you that as an example, masks, nobody ever heard of the number of masks that’s been ordered and they’re being made now and many are available now. But people, I think in the media probably don’t know that. Go ahead, behind him. I cannot explain a gap. I’m hearing very good things on the ground and we’re dealing with… Look, they had a ramp up. They had an obsolete system and they had a system simultaneously that was not meant for this. It wasn’t meant for this. Nobody knew there’d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion. Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.  I can tell you that what we’re doing is we’re working with local governments, with States, governors, even mayors on getting them to be able to get what they need and the system is starting to work out very well. But we had to break a system, like breaking an egg because the system we had was obsolete and didn’t work and that was a system we inherited. And now, we have something that’s really been very good and certainly going to be great for the future too. Yeah, . Well, we don’t want to pick winners and losers. We want everybody to benefit. We want, I think more than anything else, the workers to benefit. And sometimes for the worker to benefit, you have to go through the company because they have thousands of workers. And if the company goes out of business, no fault of their own, those workers aren’t going to be able to receive a check.  Look, our ultimate goal are the people. Our ultimate goal are the great people of this country and we will have things worked out, I think that are going to be very well. It’s a very complex formula, you understand that. It’s very complex, but it’s working out. I think it’s going to be very well. I think we’re going to have pretty uniform support for it. Please. We’re speaking with the State Department later. I can’t say right now because I haven’t had the meeting yet. Oh, please. Jeff. I can only tell you on the 14th day and we’ll have to see. We’ll have indications later on. I think they actually are doing a lot. I mean, I know New York is working very diligently, been very strong. I assume San Francisco is one of the areas and Los Angeles and the state of Washington, obviously. That’s one that has to be up there. They’re all working very hard to quarantine or words just about the equivalent of quarantine. We are and we’re using the medical term of telemedicine, and it’s been incredibly busy and really what people don’t have to… I mean, some people can’t do it anyway. They can’t get up. They can’t see a doctor. But we’re using this and it’s been tele-health, different names, and I will tell you that it’s been really successful and it’s helped a lot of people out where they don’t have to and they can’t. And even from a safety reason, if they are positive, if they are feeling poorly, they can’t do it, or we don’t want them transmitting anything to anybody else.  All right, John. Well, it would’ve been much better if we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And certainly the world is paying a big price for what they did and the world is paying a very big price for not letting them come out. Everybody knows that. We all know that. As far as believing what they’re putting out now, I hope it’s true. Who knows? But I hope it’s true.  Big difference. I don’t want to comment on that right now. Yeah, please. Worst case scenario you would have terrible job numbers. If we can get this thing wrapped up and finished earlier things will go very nicely. One of the things they’re working, as you know, one of the elements that is being worked on very much so in the Hill is to keep the jobs going so that when we do get rid of the virus, we’re going to be able to just really, I think, go like a rocket. I think the economy’s going to be fantastic. Now, when he said that he was using that as the ultimate bad outcome. I don’t think anybody believes that’s going to happen.  Go ahead. You. I know all of them, and I don’t know if they’re sitting like you people are sitting. You’re actually sitting too close. Really we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I’ll have just two or three that I like in this room. I think that’s a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it. But you’re actually much too close. You two, you should leave immediately. But, look, I know all of them. They tested positive. Hopefully they’re all going to get better. And it’s one of those things. It’s Congress. It’s one of those things. Well, I don’t think they’re going to the Hill. I mean, I know some where they tested positive, they’re in quarantine. I know Lindsey and many others, they didn’t test, but until they got the result, they put themselves in quarantine. A number of people in Congress right now are in quarantine. They don’t know the results. When they get the result, they’ll either stay there and get better… Because people get better. I mean, most people are getting better. Most, by far, the people, you get better. Doesn’t mean it’s not a tough one. It is a tough one, but no. Many people in Congress have felt not perfect or they met somebody that wasn’t perfect. It turned out to be positive and they’ve put themselves in quarantine. I think Congress has behaved unbelievably well in that regard.  We’ll know about that later. We’ll see what happens. So much depends on what’s going on in this room in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its tracks, the virus, it’s plenty. If we can’t, we’ll have to go back and talk. I do. I really do. I’m not going to say, but I think so. Look, people are coming in for money, in some cases no fault of their own, but in some cases where they did certain things over the course of the years, including buying back stock, they bought back stock and they paid a high price for it as it turned out. But maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn’t and somebody that built plants all over the United States, of which there were plenty of them too. We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry. We’ll probably be… where jobs are created. You don’t want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries. You can’t lose them. So we’ll be focused on many industries. And I have to say, I can’t say that struggle enough, we will be helping small businesses. That’s where it’s complicated because there’s a lot of small… That’s the engine of the country. We will be helping small businesses.  No. There could be. We’re looking at a couple of things that I could do. Hopefully won’t need it, but we can do. There’s a lot of executive power. If we don’t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing. Yeah, please. Thanks for telling us. We appreciate it. Go ahead. What’s the rest of your question? We know that. Everybody in the room knows that. We’ll be able to tell you that very, I think, in the near future. We’ll see where we’re going. You’re going to see numbers. You’ve seen the graphs. You’re going to see numbers and we’ll be able to let you know. I will say that the American public has been incredible for the most part, not in all cases, but for the most part. So you’ll be able to see what’s happening over the next… As we say, we had a 15-day period. You’ll be able to tell a lot in a week or so, not everything, but we’ll be able to see over a period of time.  And I have to say if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works or any of the other things that they’re looking at that are not quite as far out, but if they work, your numbers are going to come down very rapidly. So we’ll see what happens, but there’s a real chance that they might work. Go ahead, please, in the back. Well, he’s a friend of mine, number one. And number two, we had dinner the other night and everybody said he was positive and he wasn’t positive. He tested negative, so I was quite happy when I heard that. But I have no message for him other than he’s doing a good job in Brazil. He’s doing a good job in Brazil and he’s very popular. I can’t tell you about that. I don’t know about that. I have not heard that. He’s doing a very good job. Brazil was very troubled before he got there. The people love him and is popular. I think he’s doing a very good job.  In Peru? Where? Where? We know about it. We have groups. We have a group of young people in Peru, and we’re working on taking care of that with the military. Yeah, we’re looking at… No, not evacuation. We’re trying to get them out, and they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time. They didn’t make it, but we’re looking to get them out with military, probably through the military. We have a group of young people, I think young men or young people, could be women also with them, from Alabama, the great state of Alabama. They’re in Peru and we’re working on that right now trying to get them out. It’s a large group. It’s about 300. We’re going to work it out. Jeff? Yeah, we did discuss it. As you know, Prime Minister Abe was on the call, and that’s a big decision for him. We don’t know what his decision is, but we’d live with his decision. It’s a tough situation. They’ve done an incredible job. Japan has done an incredible job when building the venues, getting them built. You’ve seen so many Olympic venues that have been a disaster over the years where they cost five times more than they’re supposed to, they weren’t ready in time. Japan has been just the opposite. They built it beautifully. They built it for what it was supposed to be built for. But then he got hit with the same thing that the rest of the world got hit with unexpectedly. He has told us that he has not made a decision as to what to do. Well, the one thing I will tell you is that from the standpoint, you always get a little bit torn because until we became the leading producer, I was always for the person driving the car and filling up the tank of gas and you’d have gasoline. And the prices, if they were too high, I would always raise hell with OPEC. I was always somebody that likes it. And I never thought I’d see 22 and 24 and $28 a barrel, but that’s what we have. And in one way our consumer is very much helped. It’s like a massive tax increase. That’s bigger than any tax decrease that you could give. We can give all these big tax cuts, but they’re paying so little for gasoline. But on the other hand, it hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry. So I spoke with numerous people that have a lot to do with it, and we have a lot of power over the situation. We’re trying to find some kind of a medium ground. It’s very devastating to Russia because when you look, I mean, their whole economy is based on that. We have the lowest oil prices in decades, so it’s very devastating to Russia. I would say it’s very bad for Saudi Arabia, but they were in a fight. They were in a fight on price. They’re in a fight on output and at the appropriate time I’ll get involved.  Well, Mickey called up and he said if you need them and we haven’t said yes, I’ll call Governor Cuomo. I’ll call Gavin, Gavin Newsom, governor from California I’ll call. A few of the other governors are going to bring it up today because we’re meeting through phone, through telephone, telephonically as they say, in a little while at FEMA. I’m going over to FEMA from here. Well, you can increase places to stay. Let’s say places to stay, if it works. I mean, I don’t know, maybe people won’t want them. But he made the offer. It was a very generous offer, and he said that he has some ships that would be ideally suited for what we’re doing. And certainly they have a lot of rooms. They’re big and they have a lot of rooms, so we appreciate it from Carnival.  Go ahead. Not needing the tests? Well, no, you should only get… I didn’t have any symptoms and I got a test, but I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy. So that’s the only reason. I had no symptoms, but I had a test. My doctor told me, “Don’t get it. You don’t need it. Everybody said you don’t need it.” But I had to do it because the press was going crazy. And then after I got it, they said, “You shouldn’t have gotten it. You had no symptoms,” the whole thing. So in other words if you get it, it was no good, but I’m a unique case unfortunately. But no, people that don’t show symptoms and people that have doctors that say they shouldn’t get it, I would rely on that, yeah. I would rely on that.  OAN. Very good. Thank you very much. They treat me very nicely. Go ahead. No, I don’t think it’s racist at all. It amazes me when I read the things that I read. It amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read… The New York Times is not even… I barely read it. We don’t distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post because, you see, I know the truth. People out there in the world, they really don’t know the truth. They don’t know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week trying to catch something. Last week it was, okay… As you see me, there’s no chaos. I have no chaos. I’m the one telling everybody to be calm. There’s no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It’s really, I mean, I think I came up with the term. I hope I came up with the term, but it is fake news. It’s more than fake news. It’s corruptness. They write stories without calling anybody, they write a story. Today, I had a couple of stories where… They never call me, ever, that I know of. At least nobody tells me. They’ll write a story about me without even asking my opinion on something. It’s totally fake.  I mean, there is a story in the Wall Street Journal today about how we’ve done. We’ve done a phenomenal job on this. The governors even, even Gavin Newsom, who I’m usually fighting with over the fires and I think you should do a different kind of a job in the forest and lots of things. We argue a lot, but Gavin Newsom has been very, very generous. Andrew Cuomo has been really very generous. I mean, they’re saying we’re doing a great job and everybody is saying. But then you’ll read this phony story in the Wall Street Journal, or the Washington Post is going wild lately. I don’t know what happened to them. I guess something happened like we don’t call them back or whatever. But the Washington Post… These are very dishonest media sources. They’re very dishonest. And you know what? Someday, hopefully in five years, I won’t be here and that’ll be fine. I will have done, I think, a great job. Because I don’t think anyone’s done as much in three and a half years as I’ve done, I don’t think, and the administration. This administration has done a great job. But the press is very dishonest. Well, I think they do. I mean, they are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn’t be doing. They’re siding with many others. China’s the least of it. So why they’re doing this, you’ll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.   So ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We are very excited about, specifically, what we talked about with the chloroquine. I think it could be something really incredible. It could totally depress the times that we had mentioned.  Wait. Excuse me, excuse me. It could totally depress any time that we’re talking about if it works. There are a lot of reasons that I have to believe, again, Dr. Hahn is the expert, but a lot of reasons that I would have to think that it could have a very positive effect or a positive effect, maybe not very, but maybe positive. I think it’s, to me, very, very exciting. And the beauty is, I think I can say this, Steve, the beauty is that these drugs have been out there so the really danger part of the drugs, especially chloroquine, it’s been out there for years so we know it’s something that can be taken safely. So it’s very important.  Go ahead. Go ahead. And they are.  We’re going to have other times to meet. We’ll be meeting, hopefully not for very long. I mean, I would like to see this get cleared up, and we think we’ve… To me, this was a very important conference because I really think there’s great potential here. A lot of people are going to be trying it soon, literally very soon, literally in a matter of days, if not sooner in some cases. It’s already being experimented with and there’s been some very good results. We’ll see what happens, but if we can be even partially right, maybe we’ll be fully right, but even partially right on it, this whole subject becomes a much more pleasant subject. So thank you all. We’re going over to FEMA now, so I don’t know who’s going. But we’re going to FEMA. We’re going to be discussing with the governors and lots of other people. Now I think that’s enough. Thank you.  Thank you, everybody. "
"Thank you very much. I had a very good telephone conversation, extremely good with Senator Schumer a little while ago. We’re working on various elements of the deal and the Democrats are very much wanting something to happen and the Republicans likewise are very much wanting something to happen. And I think it will. I spoke at length with Mitch McConnell and there’s tremendous spirit to get something done, so we’ll see what happens. But my conversation was very good with Senator Schumer. I thank you all for joining us and I’d like to begin by providing an update on what we are doing to minimize the impact of the Chinese virus on our nations students. With many schools closed due to the virus, the Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing requirements. Very importantly for students in elementary through high school, for the current year. They’ve been through a lot.  They’ve been going back and forth, schools open, schools not open. It’s been all standardized testing and we’re not going to be enforcing that. So I think you can let the people know. I think probably a lot of the students would be extremely happy. Some probably not. The ones that work hard, maybe not, but it’s one of those things. Unfortunately, very unfortunate circumstance. We’ve also temporarily waived all interest on federally held student loans. There’ll be very happy to hear that. And I’ve instructed them to take that action immediately. And today, Secretary DeVos has directed federal lenders to allow borrowers to suspend their student loans and loan payments without penalty for at least the next 60 days. And if we need more, we’ll extend that period of time. Borrowers should contact their lenders, but we’ve given them very strong instruction so we’ve temporarily waved all interest on federally held student loans.  That’s a big thing. That’s going to make a lot of students very happy. And we have more to come on student loans. More good news for the students, but we’ll do that at a different time. This morning the Treasury Department also announced that we’re moving tax day from April 15th to July 15th. So we’re moving it out to July 15th so that people will have time and people will be able to, hopefully by that time we’ll have people getting back to their lives. Families and businesses will have this extra time to file with no interest or penalties. We’re getting rid of interest and penalties. However, if you have refunds or credits you’d like to claim, you may still file. In other words, you can file early if you are owed money by the IRS. Other than that, we’re moving it all the way out to July 15th. No interest, no penalties.  Your new date will be July 15th. Today, our team will also provide an update on our continuing effort to prevent the transmission of virus across America’s borders. And I watched what’s been happening in California with Governor Newsome and this morning with Governor Cuomo, and I applaud them. They’re taking very strong bold steps and I applaud them. And we’re all working together. We’re working very closely together, including those two governors. But, I would say based on the call, the media was there. I think we can say that with respect to virtually every governor in that call, I think every governor, we had almost all of them, if not all of them. And I would say that you could see for yourselves that the level of respect and  core working together was extraordinary. There was nobody angry, nobody upset. We’re able to help them and that’s what we’re all about.  We want to help. We’re doing things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do. But the relationship with governors in states is I think very extraordinary, especially under the circumstances where this just came upon us. We’re working with Canada and Mexico to prevent the spread of the virus across North America very closely. You heard what we did yesterday with Canada and Secretary of State Pompeo will be making a statement in a little while having to do with Mexico and the border. And Chad, likewise, Chad Wolf will likewise be making a statement. There’s a joint comprehensive effort in collaboration with our neighbors. The measure and all of those measures that we’re putting in place will protect the health of all three nations and reduce the incentive for a mass global migration that would badly deplete the healthcare resources needed for our people. And so we are working very closely with Mexico. Very, very closely with Canada and the relationship’s never been better.  We’re all working for the same, toward the same goal. Our nation’s top healthcare officials are extremely concerned about the great public health consequences of mass, uncontrolled cross border movement. And that would be mostly, and even beyond, but mostly during this global pandemic. Every week our boarder agents encounter thousands of unscreened, unvetted and unauthorized entries from dozens of countries. And we’ve had this problem for decades. For decades. You know the story. But now it’s with the national emergencies and all of the other things that we’ve declared, we can actually do something about it. We’re taking a very strong hold of that. And we have before, but this is now at a level that nobody’s ever approached. In normal times these massive flows place a vast burden on our healthcare system, but during a global pandemic, they threaten to create a perfect storm that would spread the infection to our border agents, migrants, and to the public at large.  Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our healthcare system, and severely damage our national security. We’re not going to let that happen. So we have a lot of information and they’ll be discussing that in a moment. To confront these public health degrees, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has decided to exercise its authority under the Title 42 of the US Code to give customs and border protection the tools it needs to prevent the transmission of the virus coming through both the Northern and the Southern border. So we’re treating the borders equally. The Northern border and the Southern border. They’re both being treated equally. A lot of people say that they’re not treated equally. Well, they are. As we did with Canada, we’re also working with Mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel. These new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.  Furthermore, Mexico is taking action to secure our own Southern border and suspend air travel from Europe. So we’re coordinating very closely, the air travel going to Mexico and then trying to come into the United States. The actions we’re taking together with our North American partners will save countless lives. At the conclusion of my remarks, Secretary Azar, Secretary Pompeo, Secretary Wolf, we’re going to be also taking some questions with Tony and Deborah, who you’ve gotten to know very well. But, there’ll be discussing certain things and I think you’ll find them of great interest. We’re going to be providing tremendous amounts of detail over the coming days, but a lot of it will be provided right now, if you’d like to find out about it. There’s been a week of resolute action, tremendous action, tremendous relationships have developed with people that frankly didn’t get along. People that didn’t like each other.  They’re now working together and maybe even in some cases learning about each other and liking each other. It’s a nice thing. I invoked the Defense Production Act and last night we put it into gear. We moved the National Response Coordination Center to the highest level of activity. I mean, if you take a look at what we did, the level of activation has been increased to a grade one level, which is the highest level. We’re providing historic support to small businesses and to the states. The states need support. Normally, they’d this themselves, but because of the magnitude of it, the federal government has gotten very much involved in terms of getting the equipment they need. So we’re helping them. It’s a responsibility they have, but we are helping the states a lot. That’s why the governors, I think in every case, have been impressed and very nice.  We enacted legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers at no cost to employers. And I think it’s very important, so they get paid sick leave at no cost to employers. We’re accelerating the use of new drug treatments. We’re advancing legislation to give direct payments to hardworking families. Throughout our country Americans from all walks of life are rallying together to defeat the unseen enemy striking our nation. In times of struggle, we see the true greatness of the American character. And we are seeing that. A lot of people are talking about it. We’re at 141 countries from what they’re telling me, and some of those countries, they’re really working in a unified manner and they’re working very unified with us. Almost, I could say, a good number of them. Doctors and nurses are working nonstop to heal the sick citizens. And churches are delivering meals to the needy.  Truckers are making the long haul to keep shelves stocked. We’ve been dealing with the big stores and the big chains, Walmart, they’ve been fantastic and others, they’ve all been fantastic. We’ve made it much easier for them to stock in terms of travel and travel restrictions. We’re lifting restrictions so they can get their trucks on time. You’re seeing very few empty shelves and yet the amount of volume that they’re doing is unprecedented because people want to have what they have to have, what they feel they have to have. And they’re also buying in slightly smaller quantities, which is good, because we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to be here. So I want to thank all of those very great companies for working so well. Americans from every walk of life are coming together and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are, we’re winning and we’re going to win this war.  America will triumph. And America will rise higher than ever before. We’ll be stronger than ever before. And we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about relying on other countries. And I can say that I think in both a very good and a very bad way. Some good things came out of it and some not so good things came out of it. So I’d like to move now to invite our team to provide information on the new measures to prevent viral spread at our borders. And I’ll start by asking Secretary of State Pompeo to speak. He’s doing a fantastic job. And like everyone else, he’s been working very, very long and very, very hard, and he’s doing the other more normal jobs of a great Secretary of State. But, he got tied into this like everybody else and he’s been really doing a fantastic job. Mike, please. Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. And we’ll take questions right after this. Chad Wolf. Thank you. Thank very much, Chad. Thank you. Secretary. Thank you very much.  Tony or Deb? Thank you very much. Tony? Good. Thank you, Tony. Mike? Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you. Go ahead. It is. I did it yesterday. We invoked it, I think, the day before. We signed it the evening of the day before, and voted yesterday. We have a lot of people working very hard to do ventilators and various other things, yes. We are. For certain things that we need, including some of the very important emergency … I would say ventilators, probably more masks, to a large extent. We have millions of masks which are coming, and which will be distributed to the states. The states are having a hard time getting them, so we’re using the act. The act is very good for things like this. We have millions of masks that we’ve ordered. They will be here soon. We’re having them shipped directly to states. No, it’s no different other than we need certain equipment that the states are unable to get by themselves, so we’re invoking it to use the powers of the federal government to help the states get things that they need like the masks, like the ventilators. Yes, ? I don’t think so. Essentially you’ve done that in California, you’ve done that in New York. Those are really two hotbeds. Those are probably the two hottest of them all in terms of hotspots. I don’t think so, because you go out to the Midwest, you go out to other locations, and they’re watching it on television, but they don’t have the same problems. They don’t have by any means the same problem.  New York, California. Miami, the governor’s doing an excellent job, Governor DeSantis in Florida. We have some pretty hot spots in Florida too, and the state of Washington, of course. But that was largely, if you look at it, it was one nursing home that had problems like you wouldn’t believe.  No, we’re working with the governors. I don’t think we’ll ever find that necessary. I am happy. I am happy with it. We’ll have to see what the results are at the end of 14 days, let’s say. We’ll know by the 15th day, to see what we do.  I’m certainly honored by the way the American people are working, because it’s work. It’s work not to work. This is the first time this has ever happened. We’re working on a tremendous financial package for them so they don’t work. Whoever heard of this? Usually you work out a financial package to get people working. We’re asking people not to work. Social distancing, that new term that’s become probably the hottest term there is. No, I’m very honored by the way the American people are are taking this so seriously. Yes, ? I think that really all of that is being discussed right now. We talked about, as an example, stock buybacks. I don’t want to have stock buybacks. I don’t want some executive saying, “We’re going to buy 200,000 shares of stock.” I want that money to be used for the workers, and also for the company to keep the company going, but not for buybacks. I haven’t spoken to a lot of the Republicans or Democrats on it. We discussed it. I don’t like buybacks. I didn’t like them the first time. We’re discussing that. We’re discussing many things. We’re not so far away. I’ll tell you, we’re not very far away. I think, without seeing too much, I’m probably more of a fan of that, maybe, than anybody. I’m a big fan, and we’ll see what happens. We all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct. It’s early, but I’ve seen things that are impressive. We’ll see. We’re going to know soon. We’re going to know soon. Including safety. When you get that safety, this has been prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem, and it’s very effective. It’s a strong drug. It was, as I understand that … Is that a correct statement? It was fairly effective on SARS? We were ordering … Yes, we have millions of units ordered. Bayer is one of the companies, as you know, big company, very big, very great company. Millions of units are ordered. We’re going to see what happens.  We’re going to be talking to the governors about it, and the FDA is working on it right now. The advantage is that it has been prescribed for a totally different problem, but it has been described for many years. Everybody knows the levels of the negatives and the positives. But, I will say that I am a man that comes from a very positive school when it comes to, in particular, one of these drugs.  We’ll see how it works out, . I’m not saying it will, but I think that people may be surprised. By the way, that would be a game changer. We’re going to know very soon. We have ordered millions of units. It’s being ordered from Bayer, and there is another couple of companies also that do it. I think we only disagree a little bit. I disagree. Maybe and maybe not. Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. We have to see. We’re going to known soon. No, I don’t think so. I think got- Such a lovely question. Look, it may work, and it may not work. I agree with the doctor, what he said. May work, may not work. I feel good about it. That’s all it is. Just a feeling. I’m a smart guy. I feel good about it. We’re going to see.  You’re going to see soon enough. We have certainly some very big samples of people. If you look at the people, you have a lot of people that are in big trouble. This is not a drug that, obviously, I think I can speak from a lot of experience, because it’s been out there for over 20 years. It’s not a drug that you have a huge amount of danger with. It’s not a brand-new drug that’s been just created, that may have an unbelievable monumental effect like kill you. We’re going to know very soon.  I can tell you, the FDA’s working very hard to get it out. Right now, in terms of malaria, if you want it, you can have a prescription. You get a prescription. By the way, and it’s very effective. It works.  I have a feeling you may … I’m not being overly optimistic or pessimistic. I sure as hell think we ought to give it a try. There’s been some interesting things happened, and some very good things. Let’s see what happens. We have nothing to lose. You know the expression? What the hell do you have to lose? John, go ahead. I say that you’re a terrible reporter. That’s what I say. I think it’s a very nasty question, and I think it’s a very bad signal that you’re putting out to the American people. The American people are looking for answers and they’re looking for hope, and you’re doing sensationalism. The same with NBC and Comcast. I don’t call it Comcast, I called Concast, for who you work.  Let me just tell you something. That’s really bad reporting, and you ought to get back to reporting instead of sensationalism. Let’s see if it works. It might and it might not. I happen to feel good about it, but who knows? I’ve been right a lot. Let’s see what happens.  John? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. I agree. My message to the American people is that there is a very low incidence of death. You understand that and we’re going to come through this stronger than ever before. If you get it, if you happen to get it, it is highly unlikely. It’s looking like it’s getting to a number. That’s much smaller than people originally thought in terms of the ultimate problem, which would be death. My message to the American people is, number one, you’ve done an incredible job, incredible what you’ve gone through. It wasn’t their fault. It wasn’t the fault of 140 other countries where this has happened and there is tremendous hope and I think we’re going to come out stronger, better, bigger in every way.  I think we’re going to be a better country than we were before. And we learned a lot. We learned on reliance who to rely on who not to rely on. Our country has been incredible the way they pulled together, including the fact that I just spoke to Senator Schumer. We had a wonderful conversation. We both want to get to a good solution, but it’s been a really, for me, watching and seeing people that weren’t speaking, getting along well because we all have one common aim and that’s to get rid of this invisible enemy. Get rid of it fast, and then go back to the kind of economy that we had. And maybe even better. Yeah, please in the back. No, the back, please. We’re going to be helping them a lot. We’re going to be focused, a big focus and including my conversation with both Mitch and with Chuck, a big focus of that conversation with small businesses, because they are really the engine behind our country more so than the big ones. They are the engine behind our country. I’m not aware of it, I saw some names. I know all of them. I know everyone mentioned Dianne Feinstein, I guess, and a couple of others. I don’t know too much about what it’s about, but I find them to all be very honorable people. That’s all I know. And they said they did nothing wrong. I find them the whole group. Very honorable people. Yeah, please. Well, it also includes Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. You didn’t mention her name. What didn’t you mention her name? And I think she’s a very honorable person by the way. So I’m not saying, but you know, it’s interesting that you mentioned two people, but you don’t mention one that happens to be a Democrat. I don’t know, because I’d have to look at it possibly, but I find them to be honorable people. Yeah. I do. Because I think Peter is, I’ve dealt with Peter for a long time and I think Peter is a not a good journalist when it comes to fairness. I think it’s a good message because I think that the country has to understand that there is indeed whether we like it or not, and some of the people in this room won’t like it. There’s a lot of really great news and great journalism and there’s a lot of fake news out there and I hear it all and I see it all and I understand it all because I’m in the midst of it. So when somebody writes a story, or does a story on television, and I know it’s false, I know it’s fake. And when they say they have 15 sources have said, and I know there’s no sources, there’s no sources, they’re just making it up. I know that. And I call Peter out, but I call other people out too. And you know, this is a time to come together, but coming together is much harder when we have dishonest journalists. It’s a very important profession that you’re in. It’s a profession that I think is incredible. I cherish it, but when people are dishonest, they truly do hurt our country. Yeah. In the back. Please, go ahead. Well, I have to say this, we have, and I can speak for myself, but I have a very good relationship with China and with President Xi. I have great respect for President Xi, I consider him to be a friend of mine. It’s unfortunate that this got out of control. It came from China, it got out of control. Some people are upset. I know President Xi, he loves China. He respects the United States and I have to say I respect China greatly and I respect President Xi. No, I never liked stock buybacks from their standpoint. When we did a big tax cut and when they took the money and did buybacks, that’s not building a hangar. That’s not buying aircraft. That’s not doing the kind of things that I want them to do. And we’re now talking about buybacks. We didn’t think we would have had to restrict it because we thought they would have known better but they didn’t know better. And some cases, not in all cases, obviously some people did an incredible job. They built plants all over the country. I mean you’d see what’s happened.  Until this invisible enemy appeared. I mean we never had an economy like this, but there were some companies that use that money to buy back stock, driving up the price of the stock artificially in many cases. I don’t like that. I don’t like it. And as far as whether or not we’ll have that allow them when we give them money because we have to keep these great companies in business because of the workers. Frankly, for the most part because of the workers, the workers are my number one concern. But the way we take care of the workers is we have to keep the companies going. I am fine with restricting buybacks. In fact, I would demand that there’d be no stock buybacks. I don’t want them taking hundreds of millions of dollars and buying back their stock because that does nothing. Yeah, please. Sure, and one thing, Secretary of State Pompeo is extremely busy. So if you have any question for him right now, could you do that? Because you know what I’d like to do? I’d like to him to go back to the state department or as they call it, the deep state department. You know, Mike. I’d like to have him go back and do his job. So does anybody have any question? Please.   Yeah, how about you? Only for the secretary. Just to put it, you know when you said before you said the non Mexicans going to Mexico, we’re not sending them to Mexico, we’re sending them back to their own country. It’s not to Mexico. Why would Mexico take people that aren’t from Mexico? We’re sending them back, in the case of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, lot of other countries, they go back to the country from where they came. Okay. Mike, please. Go ahead, finish up. Maybe we shouldn’t say that. We know plenty. They know the answer, they know the answer. Iran, the leaders. They know the answer to your question. What a good answer. Yes, go ahead. Very true, too. Excuse me, we’ll do that in a second. Let Mike- I’ll rather have, if you could finish up with the Secretary of State- Is everybody finished with the Secretary of State? Well I can just say, the entire world is agreeing with us because, they all have their choice and everybody’s doing the exact same thing. We want to shut it out and we can do that and we’ll see what happens in two weeks and three weeks. But if we can save thousands of lives and even millions of lives potentially, you don’t know where it goes, but you could be talking about millions of lives. So if you look at the the world, I mean you have some very smart people in the world. You have some smart leaders in the world and everybody’s doing it the way we’re doing it. I think we’re doing a better job than hopefully most, if not all, we’re doing a very effective job, but we’ll know better in 14 or 15 days. But you know, you’re talking about hundreds of thousands and maybe more than that numbers of people and you know, we can bring our finances back very quickly. We can’t bring the people back. Yeah, I agree with it, but I think I’d like to have Anthony answer that because to be honest, that’s what he does and we had a lot of very talented people telling us what they think we should do. Secretary of State will be leaving. Any other questions? Go ahead in the back, please. In the back, for Mike.  Excuse me, I didn’t call on you. Go ahead, please.  I’m not dealing with him, I’m dealing with the governor and the governor agrees with me and I agree with him. So far we’ve been very much in sync. I guess they’re not agreeing with each other necessarily, but the relationship with New York, I love New York. I grew up in New York as you probably have heard and the relationship’s been very good and I think government and the governor have been getting along incredibly well with the federal government. Okay. Anybody? Well, I believe in a lot of things. I want to get workers money and whichever way, the best way to get it, and I want to keep the businesses open too, because without the businesses, they’re not going to be getting money for very long. . If there’s not, we’ll do something later I’m sure. We’re not talking about $1,000 check. We’re talking about much more than that. We’re also talking about doing phases. If this doesn’t work, we’re going to keep doing until we get it going and frankly, once we get the economy back and once this enemy is defeated, the invisible enemy as I call it, once it’s defeated, we get the economy back, it’s going to all come back to us very quickly. It comes back very quickly. We have a tremendous economy. We do numbers like no other country has ever done before.  Number one in the world, if you go back two weeks and still obviously, but if you go back two weeks, number one in the world by far. That money comes back to us very rapidly. We want to keep it. We want to have it so that when we are, not if, but when we win the war with the invisible enemy, when we win it, these companies can immediately start. Not that they have to start rebuilding, which takes a long time. Steve.  Steve. I’m confident. I’m confident. We’re looking at different numbers. We have a best case and a not best case but the big thing is to defeat the virus. Once that virus is defeated, Steve, I think everything else falls in place very rapidly. I think you’re going to have a tremendous upswing. A lot of people agree with me. If you look at your stock market geniuses and some of whom are not geniuses, but they think they are, a lot of people think that I’m right about that, that once we defeat the virus, I think you’re going to have a very steep, like a rocket ship. It’s going to go up and everything will be back and I really believe we’re going to be stronger than ever before. Go ahead. You heard my news conference yesterday.  yesterday’s news. No, that does happen because they want to buy supplies. We want to buy as a backup to them in case they can’t and sometimes that will happen, but regardless of who gets them when they need them, we’re getting them to them. Now we’re doing the Production Act, we’re doing it very much and we have a lot of things cooking right now at a high level.  Remember this, nothing like this has ever happened before. Over 140 countries and you have supply chains that are broken down for two reasons because they can’t supply that much and because people are sick and they can’t be on the chain. So you have a lot of interesting things all over the world. You have supply chains that broke down because of the illness and also because of the fact that the quantity. But we’re getting it ordered, we’re getting it done and you just have to look. Some of you were at the call yesterday where I spoke with the governors, almost all of the governors, and every one of them was very impressed with what we’ve done. Go ahead. In the middle.  I would have to talk to them. I would have to talk to them. So far we haven’t had to. It’s an amazing thing that happened. We’re getting calls from automobile companies. We’re getting calls from other companies saying they have plant capacity. They want to make ventilators. They want to make other things. We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work. They want to do the job. They want to help us. They want to help our country, so we haven’t had a problem with that at all. Well when they call us they let us know. If there’s a conflict they will call us and we will drop our bid because we want them to go first because their point, at point of sale. So we’ve had four or five instances where literally that was happening because you know we’re both trying to get stock and if we’re going against, they will call us, the smart ones frankly, will call us and we will immediately, we want them to buy it because it gets to them quicker if they buy it. They know that and it’s happening more and more where they’re calling and they’re saying, we’re bidding against each other. They want to get it. They’ll get it much quicker that way.  Go ahead, please. Well, it’s going very well. I tell you what. We inherited an obsolete deal and we’ve made a good thing out of it. I haven’t heard that question in awhile, but go ahead. When we need something because of the act. When we need something, we order something and as you know, two days ago I invoked the act, which was a big step. I’m not sure that it had been done before, certainly not very much and when we need something, we will use the act. What has happened is before we even go out, many, many companies, great companies, companies in a totally different business are willing to do things and make things because that’s what they do, they make product. They’re willing to make product for us, medical product that we need very badly for the States that the States can’t get, they haven’t been able to get. And you know most of the States in no way did they do anything wrong. They were stocked up, they were all equipped. Unfortunately they’ve never had a thing like this. So they need help from the federal government.  I have. I have, yes. A lot. A lot. And they’re making it a lot of ventilators and they make it a lot of masks. Go ahead, please. Go ahead. I can’t say they are, but they will be very shortly because we’re working with one in particular, the ones to make ventilators. They called us yesterday and they’re already, we’re working on a transaction. They’re going to make ventilators. They say they’ve done it before, which surprised me, but they can do it very easily.  No, not donate. That’s not the word, donate. He’s not giving them. He’s going to let me use them. I spoke with Micky Arison who is the president, chairman, CEO and owner.  He said to me that he was willing to, if we need ships, if we need ships for helping people, that Carnival would be absolutely willing to help us in Los Angeles, in New York, wherever they may be in Miami where they’re very big. If we needed something, they would be willing to. So far we haven’t needed to. And we’re bringing the big hospital ships up in California. We haven’t, we’re working with the governor of California as you know, with Gavin and we haven’t made a determination. We’re also talking to folks who would like it in Seattle, so where we’re discussing where it can be most useful. We’ve spoken with governor Cuomo and we’re bringing the big hospital ship up in two weeks and we’re going to have it in New York Harbor someplace in New York Harbor. No, I haven’t taken them up on it yet. I said, if we need it, I’ll let you know. That’s called taking them up. Right now, we don’t need it. What I can tell you, they’re very clean and also those surfaces, the germ, as you know, the virus disappears over a period of time and these ships are very clean. They’ve been kept very clean, they’d been gone over. But the virus, as you know, if it’s on a surface for a certain, they have actually charts different kinds of surfaces, it disappears over a period of time. What are you trying to get at? Go ahead. It disappears. The virus disappears when it’s on surface after a certain number of days or in some cases, hours depending on the surface. I will be, but first I want to get the approval from the company because I don’t want to be doing that. I assume they’d like it, but I’ll let you know. One company that has openly stated it is General Motors, one of the companies,  but I didn’t speak to them about announcing it, but I’ll announce it. I’m sure they wouldn’t be. But we have others also. We’re hearing very positive things about testing and just so you understand, we don’t want every American to go out and get a test. 350 million people. We don’t want that. We want people that have a problem, that have a problem with they’re sneezing they’re sniffling, they don’t feel good, they have a temperature. There are a lot of different things. You know them better than I do. So ready. We don’t need that. But what we are having is we’re having these private labs have come in, they’ve been really fantastic and we also have a great system for the future because as I said, we inherited, we meaning this administration an obsolete broken system that wasn’t meant for anything like this. Now we have a system that you can see because look, we’re well into this and nobody’s even talking about it, except for you, which doesn’t surprise me. Well, okay, I’m not hearing it. But we don’t want everybody to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it. Yeah, we’ll do one more after this. But I do think, and that’s after listening to Tony and everybody else that’s an expert. I do think it’s important that not everybody be tested. If you feel great and if you have no symptoms whatsoever, it’s just not a good thing to be doing. Steve. Want to finish up? Go ahead. Just so you know, just for the probably a hundredth time, I, this administration, inherited an obsolete broken old system that wasn’t meant for this. We discarded that system and we now have a new system that can do millions of people as you need them, but we had to get rid of a broken old system that didn’t work. It worked only on a very limited basis and we’re very proud of what we’ve done. It’s incredible what we’ve done and this system will now serve for the future, for future problems.  Hopefully you don’t have a problem like this, but something will come up. We have now a great system and it’s almost fully in gear, but it’s able to test millions of people. But we inherited a broken old, frankly, a terrible system. We fixed it and we’ve done a great job and we haven’t been given the credit that we deserve, that I can tell you. The one that really deserves the credit are the American people because they are doing things that nobody thought they would do. What they’re doing is incredible and we’re making a lot of progress and we’ll see you folks tomorrow. Thank you very much. "
"Thank you very much. A lot of things going on and we’re going to be going over the Hill and there were a lot of meetings and from the financial, this is a medical situation, not a financial situation. Financial though is moving along very nicely. I want to thank you for being here and update you on the progress we’ve made after a week of extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus. Governors, mayors, the businesses, charities and citizens are all working with urgency and speed toward one common goal, which is saving American lives. We’re in communication with foreign countries. It’s now at 148 foreign countries. Can you believe that? 100. You talk about a spread. You talk about a violent spread, 148 countries, not even believable. There’s been a week of national action and of great national solidarity. People are getting along. We’re getting along with the Republicans and Democrats and Independents and liberals and conservatives and actually it’s a very nice thing to say.  We’re all one beautiful big American family and that’s taking place right now. Last night I approved major disaster declaration for the state of New York, worked very closely with Governor Cuomo and this is the first time in our nation’s history that a President’s used the Stafford Act to a major disaster in response to a public health crisis. Never happened before. I’m considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that and I’m working very closely with Gavin Newsom, governor of California and others. We may be doing the same thing depending on their needs, depending on what they’re asking for. It’s been unprecedented action in New York and we’ve had a tremendous federal response all over the country and I want to thank all the people in the federal government and obviously in the state governments and local governments. We are working hard, everybody is working hard and the people standing alongside of me are working very hard that I can tell you.  We’ve also reached agreements with Canada and Mexico on new travel rules at our Northern and Southern borders to halt the entry of the Chinese virus. Well continuing trade and commerce and we’ve had very good talks. I’ve with Prime minister Trudeau and today this morning with President Lopez Obrador. We talked about joint measures that we’re taking to prevent the spread of the virus in our countries and to temporarily suspend non essential travel. We had a great conversation this morning, President of Mexico and our close cooperation with Mexico and Canada will keep our people healthy, keep their people healthy, keep everybody safe. Yesterday I had a call with 12,000 small businesses, representatives of these businesses. That’s the engine of our country. People don’t realize that, you read all about the big ones, but the small business, when you add them up together is really the engine economic engine of our country, and I assured them that my administration is doing everything within, it’s very considerable, considerable power, frankly, to support them and their employees.  Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Likewise, I had calls during the week with all sorts of representatives and systems like the hospital system. We spoke to many of the hospital systems throughout the country, nurses and doctors, representatives representing hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors. Airlines and cruise ship companies, the business round table, which was fully attended and it’s all of the top CEOs of our country and beyond, frankly. The businessmen have really, these are world world styled businessmen. These are businessmen that control the biggest companies in the world. Many of them have taken hits and many of them are just going forward.  I’ll tell you, businesses have been, have been great. Some have been very badly affected, some haven’t been affected at all and frankly, some are doing very well. They continue to do very well. It’s a, Walmart i an example. It’s been really helpful to us. Doug McMillan, the head of Walmart really helpful to us and I guess I assume they’re doing pretty well cause people are certainly buying, buying more than even a clip at Christmas by substantial numbers. Pretty amazing, but they’re doing incredibly, they put on tremendous extra staff. You don’t have empty shelves. A lot of things have happened that are very good.  Restaurants, fast food executives, grocery stores, all retailers. Literally all of them in groups. And we spoke with the G7 leaders at length. As you know, you probably know about that. Spoke to many of the governors, spoke to almost all of the governors, had conference calls and many of the governors individually. And very importantly the religious leaders. We had a great conversation yesterday, the Vice-President and myself with the religious leaders of our country, many of the religious leaders and we’ve had a number of them during the course of the last two weeks actually, but yesterday we had a very, very significant call with the religious leaders of our country.  I signed legislation providing American workers with paid sick leave and paid family medical leave at no cost to employers. And free testing for those who need it. The testing’s going very well and the Admiral will speak to that along with Tony. We’re working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families. There’s never been anything like we’re doing on the Hill right now. Their negotiating, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, they’re all up there. Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi, they’re all negotiating and everybody’s working hard and they want to get to a solution that’s the right solution. I think we’re getting very close. We’ve also announced that we’ve moved tax day from April 15th to July 15th which is a big deal giving businesses and individuals extra time to file and pay without interest or penalty.  So we’ve moved the date way back and so it’ll be July 15th instead of your traditional April 15th and very importantly you will have a lot of time but you’re not going to have interest penalties or any kind of penalties by filing. At that later date, HUD announced that foreclosures and evictions are suspended for single family home owners with FHA insured mortgages for the next 60 days. And our great head of HUD, who’s with us today, Ben Carson’s going to say a few words in a moment. The Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing, which is another big deal requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year. Not fair to do that. So we were waiving that. I would imagine it’s probably the first time ever that’s been waived, but I think it’s only fair to the students and to the parents of the students.  It is also waiving interest and other things that we’re discussing right now on federally held student loans and directed that borrowers be allowed to suspend their student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days. And we’ll be talking about student loans, going to help the students. They’re under a great burden right now so we will be talking about that further. But we’re waiving during this 60 day period various elements and very important elements on student loans. Big subject. I signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, as you all know, giving us powerful new authorities to help states, cities, and hospitals procure needed supplies.  There’s been a clear call to action to the private sector and the call is made right here. It’s been really pretty amazing what’s happened with the private sector. They are really in a sixth gear I think, which has responded in full force helping to produce and supply much needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else is a, there’s a move on that’s incredible right now. And by way of example, Hanes, everybody knows Hanes, great company, great consumer cotton products company is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks. And they’re in that process right now. And at my direction, the FDA has taken rapid steps to make these items available for medical use right now. I mean most excitingly to me is what the FDA has done in order to get a possibly a very successful number. It’s not just one or two number of therapeutics, medicines that can help people that are already sick, help people not get sick. And obviously you know about the vaccine and Tony, we’ll discuss that a little bit later, but the vaccine is moving along.  But this is something that right now for right now, like this is what we really, it’s incredible. And what the FDA has done, and Dr. Steven Hahn, who’s highly respected, came as a, just a highly respected man. He’s been fantastic. He’s only been here for a couple of months and he’s gotten thrown into the swim of it and he’s really standing up. But the FDA has really moved mountains. I said it this morning they moved mountains to get approvals on things that maybe work we’ll find out very soon, it won’t take along.  Along an example of the , which is a, this is really an example where we’re purposing alcohol. They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer. That’s a big difference and they’d been unbelievable. They really, , their first delivery will be on Tuesday. It’s going to go to various states. They’re going to start, I think in New York and they’re going to work their way around. They’re making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer at a very high level too, by the way.  We’ve activated the National Response Coordination Center to level one, that’s your highest level. There’s the nerve center of all of our government response to crisis and it’s coordinating very closely with our nation’s governors. Our nation’s governors, as many of you were at the call yesterday with the governors and I think you can see the relationship. And we’ve had numerous calls with governors by the way, but the relationships are pretty amazing. They’re loving what we’re doing and the coordination between the federal government and the governors States and even local has been pretty incredible. FEMA administrator, Pete Gaynor, who is with us will soon be providing you with an update on the center’s operations and FEMA has been incredible. We got them involved last week, very much involved and now they’re involved nationwide.  We’ve dramatically expanded telehealth so Americans can see a doctor without leaving home something which more and more people are using and now they’re really using it. And now the ones that are using it are loving it. And I think we’re going to change the way our country functions medically and probably in other ways because of what’s going on right now. This will reduce the chance of infection and preserve hospital capacity. So it solves a lot of problems.  Every American has a role to play in defending our nation from this invisible, horrible enemy. It really is. It’s an invisible enemy and we will be successful, very successful, hopefully very much sooner than people would even think. So we say stay at home and save lives. There’s a time of shared national sacrifice, but it’s also a time to treasure our loved ones and to take stock of what is most important, our faith, our families, our neighbors, and our great country. And I want to thank all of the incredible people of our country, the citizens of our country, that what you’ve done and the way you’re responding has just been a very special, something that we will never forget, that the history books will never forget. And we’re going to have a great victory. We’re going to be celebrating a great victory in the not too distant future.  And I just want to thank everybody and now I’ll introduce our vice president Mike Pence, who’s led the task force. And I will tell you this, he has not slept much, maybe a tiny bit, maybe a little bit, but not much. And he’s done an incredible job. Mike, thank you. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike. Admiral. Thank you very much, Admiral. Dr. Fauci. Thank you, Tony, very much. Thank you very much, Pete, appreciate it. Ben, please. Ben, thank you very much. A few questions, please. I just took one. I feel great. I hope I look good. Those people are going to be. . Well, what they do right now is keep receiving their paycheck and hopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. We want to keep everything together because we think we’re going to have a tremendous bounce back. Now, some people agree with that very strongly. Some of our top economists, they think we’re going to have a very, once we solve the problem of that we’re working on, the medical problem. So we want them to keep their jobs, stay where you are and we’ll see what happens. Now if they don’t, we have unemployment, we have checks, we have a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things nobody has ever done. Now this is working with Democrats, this is Republicans and Democrats and myself working together. Nobody’s ever done a package like this. It’s a great package. But ideally we want them to be able to keep their jabs, keep the pay coming. And I think that’s going to happen. Kelly, go ahead. Because we have so many companies making so many products. Every product that you mentioned plus ventilators and everything else. We have car companies without having to use the act. If we don’t have to use specifically, we have the act to use in case we need it, but we have so many things being made right now by so many they’ve just stepped up. In fact, Mike Pence and I were discussing it before. We’ve never seen anything like it where they are volunteering. We want to make masks who are not, like Hanes. I brought that up as an example. General Motors, I bring that up as another, Ford. They’re going to go on the open market. We want them on the open market from the standpoint of pricing because otherwise it’s going to be, we could be very unfairly . We are directing states and sometimes we’ll be competing against states, which I don’t want and we’ll drop out of the bidding. We want the states to go first and you know what we’re doing is we’re helping states. That’s what we want to do. Same thing with the testing. We’re helping states, we’re helping states get to where they want and we’ve made tremendous progress in every aspect of it. Well, it’s happening pretty fast right now and the governors are out there trying to get and if they are competing with us, we immediately drop out. Please. My people are and I’ll be staying here. I’ll be in the Oval Office and various other places in the White House. So I’ve spoken with, I’m not going to say who I speak with, but I’ve spoken with directly or indirectly everybody many, many times. We’re doing very well. I think the Democrats and the Republicans are going to come up with a package that’s going to be really something very special. It’s going to help people. This is the first time there’s ever been a case where you want people not to work. It’s always, you want to create an incentive to work. We’re creating not an incentive not to work, but the fact is we’re asking people not to work because of they have to stay away from each other. If we’re going to kill this horrible hidden enemy, we have to stay away. So there’s never been a thing like this in the history of the world. And other nations are doing similar things, some effectively, some not effectively. They’re doing similar things.  We are creating a package that’s going to keep companies together, keep workers paid so they can live and sustain. We’ll see what the timing is. The biggest thing we can do is get rid of the problem. The problem is exactly what we know, the medical problem. We want to have this whole incredible situation that it can start right away. Not that all of these companies break up, all the workers are out of jobs. You can’t put them back together and it would take years to put them back together because we had the greatest economy in the history of the world until we got hit by this problem. And we can be back very, very quickly. And it’s our intention to be back very, very quickly.  So we’re doing a package the likes of which nobody’s ever done before. I’m obviously the one that has to approve the different things and the recommendations of the different things. And like buybacks as an example and stock buy backs. I didn’t like it the first time and this time I’m saying, “You’re not doing it.” I don’t want money to be used for that. I want money to be used for workers and for opening businesses, keeping businesses not buy backs. And well, I would, I am strongly recommending a buyback exclusion. You cannot buy back your stock. You can’t take $1 billion of the money and just buy back your stock and increase the value. Please. When will the masks start coming in? Switch it. We have a lot of them, a lot have already come in. I have to tell you, the throwing away of the mask being in private business, the throwing away the mask right away, they’re thrown away. And when you hear 55 million masks, what I’m saying, 55 million, how could it possibly be such a number? And they say, “Oh, that’s just a small fraction of what we need.” And I said, “Why aren’t we sanitizing masks?” You look at the mask, I’ve looked at all the different masks. Some don’t lend themselves to doing that, I think, but many do. And I said, “Why aren’t we …” We have very good liquids for doing this, sanitizing the masks. And that’s something they’re starting to do more and more. They’re sanitizing the masks and I don’t know if anybody who would like to speak to that.  You might want to just … I would’ve liked that much better personally. Yeah, go ahead, Mike. You mean the ones that are saying good things or bad things? Well, I’ll tell you the way I look at it. So many administrations proceeded me. For the most part, they did very little in terms of what you’re talking about. This is unprecedented. You could speak to Tony, you could speak to anybody. This is unprecedented or just about unprecedented. As time goes by, we’re seeing it’s really at a level that nobody would’ve believed. Nobody would have thought possible that this could happen and we are making much of this stuff now and much of it’s being delivered now.  We’ve also gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people that can’t believe how fast it’s coming. When I hear they have an order of 55 million masks and that’s just one order, that’s one order at our many and that there are many millions of masks beyond that that are … and I keep saying, “How is it possible to use so much?” But that’s the way it is. And part of that is because they’ll use a mask for a short period of time and they throw it.  The fact is that we are doing a tremendous amount. We started with very few masks. We had some, but nothing for an event like this, and now we’re making tens of millions of masks and other things and I think it’s unprecedented what we’ve done and what we’re doing and many doctors that I’ve read, many, many doctors, they can’t believe the great job that we’ve done.  Yah, Kelly, did you have one? Well, if you remember … I was the one that closed the country down. I was the one that closed the … You don’t write that or you don’t say it too much. Certainly on CNN, but I just read an article yesterday. I just read an article yesterday that by closing the country down so early, very early, we saved tens of thousands and much more than that lives. So you might want to report that too. Tony? And again, what we’re doing is we’re trying to help the states get things faster and that’s what we’re doing. We’re implementing. And the magnitude of this, it’s a tragedy. It’s an absolute tragedy, but the magnitude is something that no matter who you were, no matter where you come from, nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen. You read about 1917 and you read about certain things, but you think in a modern age, I thing like that could never happen.  Well it comes back, it is genius. It comes back and it’s too bad. But I think the people working on this have been incredible. The job they’ve done has really been incredible. But there’s tremendous amounts of not only masks, of ventilators and respirators and everything you can think of. It’s all being much of it and almost, I could say all of it is being manufactured right now. Steve, please. Well, I don’t know that resolved. I can say that it’s going to distributed. I know New York is getting I think 10,000 units and numerous other people. It’s really, it could be the malaria drug plus the Z-Pak. But, and we’re going to find out, we’re going to find out. I feel as the expression goes, what do we have to lose? Because I feel very good about it. Tony would feel, like he’d like samples done in a certain way and I understand that, too. Many doctors agree with that. We don’t have much time.  We have a lot of very sick people right now in hospitals all over the place and speaking with the governor in New York, Cuomo, I said, “How’s it look?” He’s got a lot of sick people, so we’re going to be delivering a lot of samples to New York and other places and we’re going to find out very shortly whether or not it’s going to work. I feel very confident. I’ve seen things that surprise me frankly.  There are, as Tony said, there are other things we’re looking at too. Vaccine of course is incredible, but this is more immediate. Right now, this to me would be the greatest thing that could happen. This would be a gift from heaven. This would be a gift from God if it works. So we’re going to pray to God that it does work. It’d be a fantastic thing. Yeah, in the back. My businesses? Sure. Well, I wouldn’t say you’re thriving when you decide to close down your hotels and your businesses. No, I would say, I’m very under levered and everything, so that’s good. But is it hurting my … yeah. It’s hurting me and it’s hurting Hilton and it’s hurting all of the great hotel chains all over the world. It’s hurting everybody. I mean, there are very few businesses that are doing well now. There are some that are like as an example, the Walmarts of the world because everybody’s lined up to get things and stock up their house and this and that. But sure, it hurts my business. No, I didn’t speak to anybody. I speak to my sons, but I talk about the coronavirus, but not as it pertains to my business. They basically follow the rules. When they say close them down in New York, we close them down or wherever they may be having. I actually have them all over the world and when they say, close them down, we close them down.  What Kelly? Well, I have nothing planned at Mar-a-Lago. But right now I think Mar-a-Lago, I guess I haven’t even asked, but I imagine that’s closed down just like a lot of other businesses in Florida. Right?  Go ahead. I don’t know. I just don’t know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I have hotels. Everybody knew I had hotels when I got elected. They knew I was a successful person when I got elected. So it’s one of those things, I guess I get paid $450,000 a year. I give it up, I put it back into the nation. I usually, I have to, by the way, you have to designate where you want it. So I oftentimes give it to opioid research and things.  But as far as the hotels and everything, I have to do what everyone else is doing. I would probably decide to close things up. I think it’s a good thing. You don’t want people getting together and hotels and clubs and everything. You get together. We want to beat this deal. So I have many of them, hotels, clubs, things like that where people get together. I would think it would be a good practice to close them up.  Yeah, go ahead, please. Well, I do it. I do it. I have temperature tests and I didn’t ask everybody here, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they had temperature tests. Otherwise, I’m going to run off the stage. Oh, I think they are pretty much. The easiest thing is the temperature. I think they are. I don’t know. Are you learning a lot from the temperature tests, Tony? Could you maybe discuss that for a second? I took his temperature. And I’ve seen things when Tony mentions thermometers. They aim something at your forehead. They say this far away, boom, and they tell you what your temperature is. I said, “I’ve never seen that before.” I’ve learned a lot. I’ve learned a lot. It’s incredible. Go ahead in the back, the back corner. Well, I love whoever you’re with that’s because I think that’s such a nice, that’s such a nice question. No, I think the Washington Post covers us very inaccurately. Covers me very inaccurately. I saw this story. I think it’s a disgrace, but it’s the Washington Post and I guess we have to live with it. It’s a very, it’s a very inaccurate, quiet, quiet. It’s a very inaccurate story. From many people, I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country, China. Unfortunately, China, I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China long prior to us reading about it. Even though the news isn’t exactly disseminated. As you know, China kicked the Washington Post out of China and they kicked the New York Times out of China and I guess the Wall Street Journal.  That’s okay. I mean that’s what they do and I think it’s a terrible thing they did. But I also think it’s terrible when people write inaccurately about you and they write inaccurately about me every single day, every single hour. And by the way, your group really, I really think, and I just say fair, not good or bad, I think you write very fairly and do very fair reports about the great job that all of us are doing. That this group behind me is doing. It’s so insulting when they write phony stories that they know are fake news because they’re not insulting me. They’re insulting everybody. These incredible people that have worked so hard, so long that are thinking about nothing other than this invisible enemy. They have done such an incredible job. And they will continue and we’re going to win and there’ll be a lot of celebration when we win and we’re going to win with as few lives lost as possible.  That’s the game. Win with as few lives lost as possible. It’s a tough enemy. It’s a tough killer, far bigger, far more vicious than ever before. But I appreciate you saying it because the fact that we closed so early to China and most people …Hey look, I was called xenophobic by sleepy Joe Biden. I was called a racist by Democrats. A racist. I was a racist because I decided that I didn’t want to have people that could hurt our country come in, and I was pretty much in a very small group of people. I will tell you, it was a tiny little group. Most people even that worked in the White House disagreed with me very strongly.  Saving of those many weeks was a tremendous thing and where they keep talking about acting early, that was the ultimate act. That was the biggest act because we didn’t, and then I also closed Europe early, very early and I took a lot of heat for that too, but that was a good thing. Now they’re doing similar things that we’re doing. So I didn’t act late. I acted early. I acted far before anybody thought I should be. I took tremendous criticism from the various papers, from many of the papers. So I very much appreciate the question.  It might’ve been more of a statement that a question. But whatever it may have been, I appreciate it very much. No. No. They can do what they want to do. If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them through all of the things we’re able to do and we we’re going to end up with a big oversupply at some point. At some point this is going away and we’re going to end up with a big oversupply and you know what, in this case that’s going to be okay.  But if California, if Gavin can go out and order gowns faster or masks, good masks faster or other things faster, that’s good. We do have a lot of … The coordination with the ships that we’re sending in, as you know, the medical ships that we’re sending in and even cruise liners. We’re going to be sending in probably cruise liners into some areas in particular California and in particular New York. But if somebody can do something faster, if they can order that mask faster than us, I want them to be able to do it. We coordinate very much with them. Yes. Well, it doesn’t have to be at this moment because we have places in the country where, states where they have two people, or three people and those people are in quarantine and you can’t put on them what you’re putting in New York where you do have a tremendous problem. We have large portions of the country, middle America where they have a few people. So it may be a time, I hope that never happens where we need to take very drastic action. But right now that’s not in the same ballpark. Yeah, go ahead, please. Yes. I think they are, and some people are not. But, I think they are. I think it’s going to have a very profound effect. We’ll know a little bit more on day 14 and 15 and we’ll see. Well we’re going to see. We have to see what the result is. We want to flatten that out and we’re going to see what the result is. And I just want to say, I’m going to negotiate a very large transaction and I’ve been negotiating it for two days. So I’m going to take one or two more questions and then I’m going to leave it to Vice President Pence.  On the Hill, with the Hill, the various elements of the package. Steve, go ahead. No, no I haven’t. Look, we understand the difficulty of that and he’s a very good friend of mine. You take a look at Shinzo Abe. He’s a great gentleman. He loves his country. We have an incredible relationship. We just finished a trade deal with them, $40 billion trade deal with Japan.  We just finished a trade deal with them, 40 billion dollar trade deal with Japan, and Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. They have built one of the most beautiful venues I’ve ever seen. They’re all ready to go. It’s not late. It’s not over budget. It was just done flawlessly, and it’s beautiful, and they’re sitting back and saying … I told them. I said “That’s your decision.” And it is his decision, and I know he’s going to make it soon. I don’t know what it’s going to be, and I didn’t think I should be influencing it at all.  I mean, the job that Japan has done on that venue is incredible. So there are options, obviously, including delay, and maybe delay for next year, but that’s totally up to them. We’ll see what they do. When I learned I started doing the closing, so probably around that time. We didn’t learn much. I think you’re going to ask a little bit about China responsibility. I do think that, again, I have great respect for China. I like China. I think the people of China are incredible. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. I wish they could’ve told us earlier about what was going on inside. We didn’t know about it until it started coming out publicly, but I wish they could’ve told us earlier about it, because we could’ve come up with a solution.  Tony Fauci, and all of the people, the talent that we have would’ve loved to of had three or four months of additional time if you knew that this was going to be happening. They didn’t have that time. They read about it in the newspapers like everybody else. China was very secretive. Okay? Very, very secretive. And that’s unfortunate. With that, I have great respect for that country. I have great respect for the leader of that country, and like him. He’s a friend of mine. But I wish they would’ve told us earlier, Steve, that they were having a problem, because they were having a big problem, and they knew it.  And I wish they could’ve given us an advanced warning, because we could’ve had a lot of things, as an example, some of the things that we’re talking about where we order them as quickly as we can. If we had a two or three month difference in time it would’ve been much better.  Yeah, please. Yeah. Because it’s true. Because it’s true. China has worked very hard. China has lost thousands and thousands of people. No. They weren’t transparent. They were transparent at that time. But when we saw what happened they could’ve been transparent much earlier than they were. Just so you understand. China’s not a beneficiary here. China has lost thousands and thousands of people. China has gone through hell over this. They’ve gone through hell. And I’ve had conversations with President Xi. I just wish they could’ve told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could’ve said that. Thank you. I’m going to leave that up to Dr. Fauci and everybody else, and I think the answer is we want to share them. I would imagine we want to share the numbers. Admiral, do you want to discuss that? Half a billion, no, not billion. Yes. I said, wait a minute. There’s never been numbers like this. A ventilator is a machine. It’s a very complex machine and to think that we have to order hundreds of thousands nobody’s every heard of a thing like this. We had thousands in a stockpile. Thousands ready to go. That’s a lot. All of a sudden you need hundreds of thousands. The mask is … Whether it’s plastic, or whether it’s material, that’s one thing, but you’re talking about a very sophisticated heavily computerized machine, and delicate, and you need hundreds of thousands of them. Nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that.  With that being said General Motors, Ford, so many companies … I had three calls yesterday directly. Without having to institute like “You will do this” these companies are making them right now. But to think of these numbers it’s pretty mind-boggling. Michael, please. You understand it. You understand it. You’re an intelligent woman, Kelly. You understand exactly what he’s saying, and what he’s saying is rather incredible, because we inherited an obsolete broken system, and when you hear the number of tests that we’ll be providing, and are now, it’s incredible. I’ve heard a lot of governors say the same thing. We took over an obsolete broken testing system that wouldn’t of worked for even a small problem let alone one of the biggest pandemics in history.  And what these gentleman have done is incredible. I am going now to negotiate a great deal for our workers and our citizens. I’ll be back tomorrow. We’re probably doing this tomorrow, and if I might I’d like to ask Vice President Pence to take over, and thank you all very much."
"Thank you very much. Just before we begin, I want to mention we’re working very hard, long on getting a young group of people out of Peru. We’ve removed some and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government. And we’re also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up. And we are working in that very well again with the Honduran government’s work. And they’re working with us, so I appreciate that.  We have a couple of other locations that will report to you and we were able to get a young woman released from a certain area who was being a horribly accosted, horribly treated. And we spoke to General Milley. General Milley took care of it. We went in and we got her out. And we’ll report further on that one, but it’s, that was rough stuff. I want to thank General Milley. I want to thank all of the people that were involved and the people that went in to get her. I want to thank you very much.  As we continue to marshal every resource at America’s disposal in the fight against the Chinese virus, we were profoundly grateful to our nation, state and local leaders, doctors, nurses, law enforcement and first responders who are waging this battle on the ground. It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government’s guidelines. So important about social distancing, non-essential travel, and hand-washing. Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American.  I want to just say that Senator Rand Paul, a friend of mine, he’s been a great friend of mine. He’s been always there when we needed him, when the country needed him, and as you know, he just tested positive. Jose Diaz-Balart, I spoke to him yesterday, tested positive. And some people are getting quite close to home. And it’s a terrible thing that’s going on, the hidden enemy. I call it the hidden enemy. And I think they’ll all be fine. I hope they’re going to be fine. But I just want to send our regards. And I think I can speak on behalf of our country to those two great friends of mine.  We’re working urgently with Congress on legislation to support the millions of workers, small businesses and industries who’ve been hit hard by the virus through no fault of their own. Our goal is to get relief to Americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll. This will help our economy and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over. I think it’s going to skyrocket. It’s a pent up demand. It’s a built up demand. And I guess you really have to say who knows, but I think it’s going to be a tremendous day when we win this war. And we will win the war.  We want to win the war was with his few, if you look at it, just deaths as possible. We want to have as few number of deaths as possible. Today I’m announcing action to help New York, California, and Washington ensure that the national guard can effectively respond to this crisis. The national guard, these are tremendous people. They’re fully on alert. We’ve signed what we had to sign. And it’s been activated.  We’re dealing also with other states. These states have been hit the hardest actually pretty much by far you could say the hardest. Everybody can see that. Just look at the numbers. And through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100% of the cost of deploying national guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus while those governors remain in command. So the governors locally are going to be in command and we’ll be following them. And we hope they can do the job and I think they will.  I spoke with all three of the governors today and just a little while ago. And they’re very happy with what we’re going to be doing because we will be announcing some other things for those three states and some other states where it’s a hit the hardest.  This actually will give them maximum flexibility to use the guard against the virus without having to worry about cost or liability. And freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state. The federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our national stockpile to locations with the greatest need in order to assist in those areas. I approved the state of New York’s request for a major disaster declaration, something which Governor Cuomo has been asking for and which I agree. And we had it done in very rapid fashion.  We approved this on Friday evening. And we are working very, very hard to get all of these things not only signed up but completed and finished and win. The requests from the state of Washington for a major disaster declaration was approved just a little while ago. Went through the process and we moved it very quickly. The request from the state of California was just received and we will have it approved very quickly. We’ll be working, I told that to Gavin Newsome. And we’re working on getting that done very quickly. It’ll be done maybe tonight. We have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way based on all of this to those states including respirators, surgical masks and gowns, face shields, coveralls and gloves with large quantities already delivered to Washington and to New York. In addition to large quantities of supplies, I’ve also directed FEMA to supply the following, four large federal medical stations with 1000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1000 beds for the state of Washington. The governors know.  The supplies in route to California in New York will be delivered within the next 48 hours. In addition, the Naval hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, it’s incredible ships. These two ships are incredible. One on the West coast, one on the East coast will be deployed to Los Angeles to add emergencies, surge medical capacity, and they have a tremendous capacity. They are really something. I will say that if you look at some of the things we’ve been doing and now those numbers have gone up, and just to be a little bit more exacting, we’ve done a presidential approval for requests for major disaster declaration for the state of New York, approval of Title 32 national guard activation for the state of New York. We’re providing all of this at no cost to the governor. I spoke with Governor Cuomo. He’s working hard, we’re all working hard together. The relationship is really been amazing.  But it also enables the governor to provide robust national guard support to the state and the 25%, we’re going to be waving that 25% cost. We’re picking up, we’ll be coordinating. And they’ll be doing something with very special people. Mission assignment of the US army Corps of engineers to provide support to build out alternate care sites. They’re doing various alternate care sites which have now been designated by New York, four large federal medical stations of 1000 beds. These are very complex places actually with great equipment and great people. Strategic national stockpile order and this is as of a number of days ago, so far delivered to New York and this is the 19th, we had the N95 respirators, 186,416 delivered. We’ve delivered 444,000 O78 surgical masks, many have been delivered since then. Face shields, we’ve delivered 84,560 face shields, surgical gowns 68,944 to New York, coveralls 352, gloves 245,486.  Also to New York in terms of what’s been delivered just since then. The numbers are quite large and we have tremendous numbers of companies also making equipment for the state of Washington. We’ve delivered 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks. This is as of about three days ago. Face shields 63,788 face shields, surgical gowns 107,850, gloves 240,376 and we have many, many things pending. It’s actually not pending. They’re being fabricated, they’re being made. And they’re moving.  Now for Washington, so we have four small federal medical stations 250 beds, and for Washington, state of Washington, we have three large federal medical stations 750 beds. And then you have, as I said, the approval of the Title 32 national guard.  State of California, again, to be very precise, we’re going to have the approval of the Title 32 national guard activation. And we’re providing all of this again, like in New York, at no cost to the governor, meaning to Governor Newsome, and the state, no cost to the state. It enables the governor to provide robust national guard support to the state, so they’re going to have control of the national guard. Federal government’s sending, these are incredible people that are being sent.  We have eight large federal medical stations with over 2000 beds and that’s going to California and then strategic national stack pile order. We’ve ordered likewise hundreds of thousands of different items, won’t go into the exact numbers but the numbers are very substantial, but we’re having tremendous additional numbers sent. And whatever the states can get, they should be getting.  I say we’re sort of a backup for the states. And some of the states are doing really well and some don’t do as well. The ones that don’t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit very hard. And the outpouring from the private sector has also been extraordinary. I’m pleased to report that Honeywell, great company, has just announced it will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks. They’re very hard to get, they’re actually quite complex, for the US government strategic national stockpile. They’ll be immediately then delivered to the various states. This expansion is already underway and it’s going to provide a lot of jobs for that state, probably around 500.  The masks will be distributed by the government for the use of the health, safety, and emergency, and this for response workers, primarily for response workers. These are very high end. This expansion is in addition to Honeywell’s action to more than double production of its existing personal protective equipment manufacturing plants. They make a lot of different things and they’re doubling and tripling their production. They’re going round the clock.  Today, I’m also announcing the launch of a new public private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy, and IBM to unleash the power of American super computing resources to fight the Chinese virus. The following leaders from private industries, academia and government will be contributing. And they’re going to be contributing a lot of different things, but primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines. There’ll be working along with NIH and all of the people that are working on this. But tremendous help from IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy’s national labor laboratories, the National Science Foundation and NASA. They’re all contributing to this effort. And they’re fully in gear.  This afternoon, I also want to update you on the steps we’re taking to protect and serve our country’s 18 million veterans. These are great people. Our amazing veterans have shown their eternal loyalty to our nation and this is the time where they’re in need and we are going to show our loyalty to them. We’re being very protective of our veterans. We’re working on certain hospitals where we may be doing some work in Louisiana in particular and some other states, veterans hospitals. We’re going to be very protective of our veterans. Some of them are of that very vulnerable age. And some of them obviously are not feeling well. And some of them are still suffering the wounds of war from many years ago.  Yesterday I signed vital legislation to ensure that the GI bill will cover distance learning during this emergency. I also spoke with many of our veteran service organizations or the VSOs to describe our unprecedented action. In February, the department of veterans affairs established 19 emergency operation centers throughout the country. One of the things that they’ve been trying to get done for many years, you all know this from following me over the last number of years, but we got it done pretty quickly. They’ve been trying to get it done for many, many decades was choice, veteran’s choice and also veterans accountability.  Now if it’s crowded within this, if they can’t get to a doctor, we have great doctors in the VA. I have to say that. We have fantastic doctors as good as they come. But it’s hard to get to them because of what was bureaucracy, but no longer bureaucracy. We’ve done a lot of things in that case because of accountability. When people aren’t doing their jobs or if they’re bad or if they’re sadistic or if they steal or anything bad happens, we’re now allowed to fire them for, I signed that a year and a half ago. For many years you weren’t able to do this.  So the VA is working and I was just told by our great leader at the VA, Robert Wilkie, he said for the first time we get the highest marks in the history, highest poll numbers in the history of the veteran’s administration came out a week ago that they’re happy. And look, one of the reasons that happened, highest in history, one of the reasons that happened is because of veteran’s choice. If they have to wait in line, they go and see a private doctor and we pay the bill. And they get better.  They don’t have to wait two weeks and three weeks or two days. But they get better. And a lot of times they waited so long that they would have a problem and it would end up being terminal because they couldn’t get the kind of treatment that they deserve. So highest poll numbers, highest approval numbers in the history of the VA. I was just given that information yesterday.  We restricted visitors access to 135 veteran community living centers, which has nearly 8,000 veterans with chronic medical conditions so that we limit their exposure to the virus. We want to totally take care of our veterans and that’s what we’re doing. The VA has canceled most elective medical and surgical procedures. They’re delaying them until after this has gone, after we’ve won. We began providing lifesaving care to patients who had symptoms across the 171 VA medical centers nationwide, that’s a big deal.  Under my administration, the VA has also been a leader in expanding telehealth. Telehealth is becoming a bigger and bigger factor in medicine. This month we’ve taken bold action to cut through the red tape and make telehealth available for millions more Americans during this crisis. They can speak to a doctor from the safety of their home rather than risk becoming infected, or making a tremendously long trip, when frankly you’ll speak to a great doctor right from your home. It’s happening, telehealth. We’re very much at the forefront of that too. We’re very proud of it. And it also takes a big burden off our system.  We continue to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines. We’re also aggressively investigating a number of antiviral therapies and treatments to determine their potential in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms. And you know how I feel because how I feel is on Tuesday, they’re going to be starting it on Tuesday morning, and we’re going to have some medications delivered that we’re going to see if they work.  They certainly are effective in other ways and they are safe from the standpoint is that they’re not killing people. We’re not going to have that. So a lot of great things have been happening in that regard. I just want to finish and then we’re going to ask a couple of people to say a few words that have been so much in the forefront of this incredible job that we’ve all been given.  But I want to say that I know that this is a challenging time for all Americans. We’re enduring a great national trial and we will prove that we can meet the moment. I want to assure the American people that we’re doing everything we can each day to confront and ultimately defeat this horrible invisible enemy. We’re at war. In a true sense, we’re at war. And we’re fighting an invisible enemy. Think of that.  For those of you who are feeling alone and isolated, I want you to know that we are all joined together as one people eternally linked by our shared national spirit. We love our country, a spirit of courage and love and patriotism. No American is alone as long as we are united. And we are united, we’re very united. People are saying things now that three weeks ago they didn’t talk that way. We’re very united.  No force is equal to the strength of really a unified America, united America, an America like we have it right now. For those worried and afraid, please know as long as I am your president, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you. And I will not stop until we win. This will be a great victory. This is going to be a victory. And it’s going to be a victory that in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected.  It’s now attacking. The enemy is attacking 144 countries at this moment, 144 that’s unthinkable. There’s never been anything like this. And it’s vicious. It is vicious. Some people recover well. And some people have a hard time. We all know that, but we will be totally victorious. We will then get our economy up to a level that it was and in my opinion beyond, because that will be a pent up demand. There is a pent up demand. And a lot of great things will happen. But I’m very proud of our country. I’m very proud. I’m very proud to be your president. And it’s just something that’s just, you’re very special people. So thank you very much. And I’m going to ask if I might, combination of Pete, why don’t you start off. Okay? Please. Thank you. Thank you, Pete, very much. Good job. Peter Navarro? Thank you, Pete, very much. Good job. Mike Pence. Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike.  So just a couple of little things, then we’ll take some questions. Maybe you will have some, maybe you won’t. That’d be a shock. You’ll shock the American public.  But I have to say on the testing if this works out and we think it might, the new test will be a very simple one and much easier than the existing test, which is quite complex and not a lot of fun to take. And this will be a game changer.  But remember we inherited a broken, obsolete system. It was good for a small number of people, but not good for the millions of people that we’re talking about. And we’ve made this into a system that no matter where you go in the world, that’s where they’re going. That’s what they want to do. That’s how they’re going to be doing it, should something like this happen again.  So our people have done a fantastic job, really a fantastic job and I hope the new test works out. We’ll know fairly soon. I think, doctor, we’re going to be knowing about that fairly soon. Hopefully, it’ll check out or test out and we certainly are looking forward to that. That’ll be a very simple test by comparison. Won’t be unpleasant at all.  One other thing: the ships. We have the Mercy and it’s going to California, as you know. It’s on the West Coast now. And you have a sister ship; it’s essentially a twin. They’re incredible. I mean, they’re incredible ships.  I’ve seen it. I’ve seen one of them and they are unbelievable what they can do and the capacity. Many operating rooms. They’re wartime ships. They are meant for war. Many, many operating rooms. Stainless steel, these rooms are as good as there is anywhere in the nation, actually.  I spoke with Governor Cuomo. We had a great conversation today, a number of conversations, actually. He’s working very hard. And we are going to be bringing that ship that’s called the Comfort. So you have the Mercy and the Comfort. The Comfort’s on the East Coast and that ship will be coming over the next three weeks, three or four weeks. It was in the middle of maintenance and we are moving the maintenance very, very quickly.  We’re also supplying the ship simultaneously. It’s actually big supplies going into those ships. Big. And that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks and we’ll probably be putting it in New York Harbor. We’re making arrangements for that also, as to where it’s going to be docked.  So you have the Mercy and you have the Comfort. They’ll be coming up. The Mercy will start very, very quickly. It’ll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty soon, so we look forward to that.  A question? ABC, go ahead. Gee, I think it was quite a while ago. I don’t know. It’s been a long time. Who are they, please? Who are they? I guess Rick is coming out. Romney’s in isolation? Gee, that’s too bad. Go ahead. No, no. None whatsoever. I was thinking about it today and I’m saying you could have a lot of senators, a lot of House members. I spoke last night with a very, very good man who happens to be in the House, as you know, and he’s just started and he tested positive. So you could have a large number of people in there from Congress. You could have between House and Senate, you could have a large number.  I think it’s something, at least … I mean, I fully understand why you should be there. I think it may be a constitutional reason why you should. But if we could be in a position where, I would certainly be in favor of it, where they could vote from a certain outside location. I would be in favor of it.  I was thinking about it today. I mean, we could be in this … Look, with what’s going on, nobody’s ever seen anything like this. You could have a lot of people in there from Congress. And it would certainly be … They tell me there’s a reason constitutionally and there may be, but I would be totally in favor of it on a temporary basis. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we have an interesting thing. You know, we all want to get to the same place, but we have different … And I just wrote this down just a little while ago. We want to protect the worker very much. So do they, so do the Democrats. We also want to protect the worker through their companies.  We don’t want to necessarily … We’re going to help the worker anyway. But ideally, they can go back to one of their great companies.  You have great companies that are in financial trouble now, and we need money to help those companies so they get back into where they should be: health. Most of these companies four weeks ago were having the best year they’ve ever had. Last year was the best year.  Almost all of them other than Boeing, which is, incredibly, had problems. Big percentage of GDP. But we have to be able to work with Boeing. Boeing was a great company and will be a great company again I think shortly. So we have to work with the companies and they don’t want to do that. It’s crazy. They don’t want to do that.  I don’t want to stock buybacks, so I don’t know where the problem is there. But I know that’s one of the things that they’re talking about. I do not want stock buybacks. I don’t want to give a bailout to a company and then have somebody go out and use that money to buy back stock in the company and raise the price and then get a bonus. Okay?  So I may be Republican, but I don’t like that. I want them to use the money for the workers. I want them to use the money for the company, to help the company. In the airline business, to take care of their planes and all of the things they have to do, including buying new planes.  But I don’t want to have any stock buybacks. The Democrats are with me. I don’t know what the problem is on that one, because I can’t imagine that is too tough. We want to be able to take care of our people.  You’re going to have things coming up. We’re going to have some of the elements that they’re talking about. They’re down to, I mean, literally 95% of things that you would think that they wouldn’t agree and you’d think the Republicans wouldn’t agree to it.  Unemployment, as an example, is one of the things they talk about and unemployment insurance. I think we’re very close on that. But right now they’re not, so right now they’re not there. But I think that the Democrats want to get there and I can tell you for a fact the Republicans want to get there.  I don’t think anybody actually has a choice. It’s a bold package. It’s a big package. One of the things is we do have money for saving small businesses. I don’t imagine the Democrats, because we have a lot of money set aside for small businesses.  We also have a lot of money set aside for big businesses. You know the big, powerful companies that were powerful four weeks ago and today they’re overextended.  Look at the cruise line. That’s a tremendous business, a big business, very important to Florida. And it’s unthinkable a month ago, it just unthinkable. They were setting all sorts of records, they’re building new ships.  We can’t let the cruise lines go out of business. I mean, that would be massive numbers of jobs for our country and actually for the world. But for our country, it’s a massive business and it doesn’t take much to keep them going. So we have to provide for that.  But I think both the Democrats and the Republicans are agreed that we have to take care of our workers. And we’re going to be doing that in numerous ways, including a substantial cash payment.  Yeah, please. Well, it depends which governors you’re talking about. Well, we are using it now. The fact that I signed it, it’s in effect, but we’re a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela, ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out, not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept, but I’ll tell you why. As Peter said, we may have to use it someplace along the chain, but we’re getting calls. Here’s the beauty of it. If we go out and we want, let’s say masks, we don’t know who to call on mask, but Hanes who makes things of cotton, various elements, lots of things. It’s a great company. They called us and they said, we’re going to make millions of masks. We got a call today from 3M, there’s a big article today. The head of 3M. They are going to make tremendous products and they’re more or less in that business.  And if they’re not, like for instance, General Motors spoke to us, Ford spoke to us about doing ventilators. The beauty is they’re calling us. If you go the national route, nationalization route, we’re going to tell a company to make a ventilator. They don’t even know what a ventilator is. In the case of one company, they used to make them years ago and they know how to make them. It’s a very complex piece of equipment, frankly. So what we’re doing is, I think Peter said it may be better than anybody’s going to say it. We have the threat of doing it if we need it, we may have to use it somewhere along the supply chain in a minor way, but we have millions of masks being done. We have respirators, we have ventilators. We have a lot of things happening right now.  So just the threat of using it, but using it’s actually a big deal. I mean, when this was announced, it sent tremors through our business community and through our country, because basically what are you doing? You’re talking about you’re going to nationalize an industry or you’re going to nationalize, you’re going to take away companies, you’re going to tell companies what to do. The truth is most people, nobody would know where to start. There are companies out there that you wouldn’t think of that have called us that say, “We can do ventilators. We used to do them years ago.” And they can do them in large quantities. If I call companies and say, “You build ventilators,” they don’t even know what a ventilator is.  So it’s really working out very well. One of the reasons I read the numbers to you is because we’ve given vast numbers of just about everything. We’ve taken it out of our supply, and we’re restocking our supply. But we’re really backing up the governors. The governors have to go out and do their things and you have a lot of governors, they’ve done a fantastic job. You have some that haven’t. Usually, it’s the ones that complain that have the problems. But we’ve had a great relationship as an example with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Newsome. We’ve had a great relationship with the state of Washington. Those are three hotbeds. Those are three hotbeds. Now, we’re also dealing with other states. As the Admiral said yesterday, we’re dealing with all of the states actually in one form or another. Some are very affected in a very minor way where you have two people or three people, and I don’t even mean deaths. I mean literally cases. And that’s different than New York, where you have tremendous where everybody, I lived there for a long time. Everybody’s extremely close, tight, and you have a lot of cases in New York. You have a lot of cases in New York, and we’re helping Governor Cuomo, we’re helping Governor Newsome. Frankly, they’ve been total gentlemen. They want to get it done and we want to get it done. But doing it the way we’re doing it is much better. It’s really much better. But it all comes from… Yeah, I know. You’re right. We coordinate with the states and we are coordinating with the states, and for the most part the coordination has been very good. Look, three days ago I had a phone call with all the governors. I actually allowed the press to stay. They weren’t supposed to stay. And one person in the media said “That was surprising. It’s actually a little risky doing that.” Because we had Democrats and we had Republicans, and they’re politicians, and they always have something to say. Well, I took a lot of calls, and we really didn’t get one nasty or bad response. They were thanking us for the job we did.  And I had the press standing, I don’t know if you were there. I don’t think so. I had the press standing there watching. They weren’t supposed to be there, but I said “Let them stand there.” The governors were very complimentary, very, very complimentary. And I watched over the last few days, Governor Cuomo, I watched Gavin Newsome in California, I watched both of them. And they’ve been very complimentary. And those are really the hotbeds, and so we want to keep that going. I’m very proud of this country and I’m frankly very proud of a lot of the politicians that normally we’re fighting with. We have different views on things, a little different view, but we’re going to get to the same place. We have different views, but we’re going to get to the same place. Yes, please. We have been asked about that and we’re going to take a look at it. It’s a bit of a problem, but when we talk about totally nonviolent, we’re talking about totally nonviolent prisoners. We are actually looking at that. Yes. Go ahead real quick. Well, I could ask… Anybody? Would you like to take that one, Bob? But this is just like all of the other stuff that you, not you, but that the press was asking, all of which turned out to be, we actually gave CDC more money, not less money. They said we defunded, it turned out it was more money. Every one of those things that were said were 100% wrong. And this sounds like another one of them. But anyway, go ahead. And I wish, again, our relationship with China is a very good relationship. I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn’t know about it. They knew about it, and they should have told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. If you look at what’s happening in Italy, in Spain, and a lot of other countries, we could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. Kelly? Well, I hope we won’t have to. It’s possible, but we’ll have to see how that works. As far as the Senate is concerned, we are looking at some of the folks who are feeling very good, some are quarantine, but they’re negative. They may be totally fine. Others are positive. We’re just finding this now for the first time. I mean over the last two days we found that. No, I don’t see any threats at all. Honestly, I don’t see any threats at all. It’ll all work out. It is a question and a very good question, I thought, that we are considering. Now, I don’t know if you can do it constitutionally, but we are considering letting people vote senators, congressmen and women, vote from a separate location. From an outside, namely a hospital or a home, depending on where they are. So we are looking at that. It’s a little trickier question most people would believe, but we are looking at that very strongly. Well, we’re dealing with them all the time. And we’re dealing with Mitch. We’re dealing with the other side. Everybody wants to get there. We’ll see what happens. I think you’ll get there. To me, it’s not very complicated. We have to help the worker. We have to save the companies. Because as soon as we’re finished with this war, it’s not a battle. It’s a war. As soon as we’re finished with this war, our country is going to bounce back like you’ve never seen before.  But, we have to get into that position, and we have to make sure that those companies are whole, that they haven’t been disbanded. Because if you do that, it’s going to take much longer. So in a way it’s being penny wise if you don’t, but we want to help the worker. We want to help the companies that the workers come from, because if those companies go out of business, and that includes small businesses. We have a tremendous amount of small business work in there. You know that. Once they go out and they don’t come back, that’s a much longer period of building. Bad things were happening to her in a certain country, and we’re really under the feeling that we should keep it somewhat private until she’s already been freed, and I have to tell you General Milley and his people were unbelievable. They were not playing games. General Milley does not play games. He’s a very interesting guy. They got her out. They got her out of a certain situation where she was seriously abused, accosted. And whatever the maximum word is other than death. That happened. But we got her out and she’s okay and she’s back with her parents. Yes. Look, I have the best people in the world. I think we’re doing an extraordinary job. If you look in, let’s say the H1N1, you look at that whole, that was a disaster. That was a tough period of time for our country. You look at so many other things that weren’t handled very well, whether it’s Katrina or something else. Look, I respect everybody, but I feel I have an incredible team and I think we’re doing an incredible job. When you look at the job we’re doing, and all you have to do is look at the approval numbers on the job we’re doing. I think we’re doing an incredible job, so I don’t want to disturb them, bother them. I don’t think I’m going to learn much, and I guess you could say that there’s probably a natural inclination not to call. Now, if I felt that if I called, I’d learn something, and that would save one life, it would save one life. Okay. I would make the call in two minutes, but I don’t see that happening. Please. I’m of the opinion we have to do great during these 14 days, during the 15 day period. We’ll know at the end of 14 days pretty much we’re going to have a pretty good idea how we’re doing. I think you have to shut it down and you have to see, but there’ll be a point at which we say “We’re back in business. Let’s go.” Those two statements are not mutually exclusive, if you understand. I saw both of them today and they sort of intermesh. He’s calling for a faster, just a brutal shutdown, and then open up maybe a little bit faster. So there’s that fine line. Look, we did a big shutdown when we wouldn’t allow people from China that could have been very seriously infected that were when we cut that off very early, and then we cut Europe off very early as you know. So that was also very . Well, I can’t tell you that. What I have to say is that I think we’re going to have good results. I think the American people have been amazing. I think our stimulus package will get done and it will be a tremendous package. They may not have gotten those votes, but they’re very close to getting a deal done. So I’d be surprised if they didn’t. And if they don’t, I think frankly the American people will be very upset with the Democrats because the Republicans are ready to approve a deal. So the only reason the deal couldn’t get done is pure politics. Yes, please. Well, he should have the hospital systems in various places. Some have been stocked and ready to go for… Nothing for this. Nothing. This is beyond anything that anybody ever thought possible. I think you could really say this. Nobody can really, Dr. Nobody can really say, “Oh gee, this will happen.” This is a very unique and hopefully it will be unique for many, many centuries for a long time. Hopefully we don’t see this again. But again, the systems are supposed to be ready, willing, and able. This is supposed to be ready to go. We are helping them a lot, and I have great love for New York City and I have great love for New York state. And we’re going to help them a lot.  I mean, I was just saying we’re sending our ships up there. We’re sending more than just this ship. We may be using, if we need, we’ll be using some of the cruise ships that you’ve been reading about. We’ll be using them also because they’re very immediate and very quick. They can be there very quickly. We have good docking systems in the places that we’re talking about. So we may be using some of the cruise liners that we’re talking about. But no. I mean I think Bill de Blasio is working very hard. I think he’s trying very hard. It’s a tough situation for him and every mayor because nobody’s ever seen the scale. When you hear you’ve given millions of masks and you’ve given hundreds of thousands of masks in a certain short period of time, and then you hear they need many, many more.  One of the things they have started with respect to masks is the sterilization process. Some, it works very well. Others aren’t really set up that way. You throw them out. But we have a sterilization process that’s working very hard. Speaking of that, hand sanitizers, when you asked the question on the companies and what’s going on, we have many companies now, companies that made whiskey, they’d made alcohol, they’ve now gone very quickly into the hand sanitizers. And all of you know, you’ve been reading about three or four big companies, we’re doing incredibly well on that.  There was no way if you took the existing companies that something like that could happen. But it happens almost… They’ll call Peter Navarro, or they’ll call somebody. On one case they called me, they said, “We can do this, we can do that.” We’ve had a lot of those calls where companies want to… There’s a company in New Hampshire, a great company, they want to make ventilators. I’d never thought of them for ventilators, but they do make metal equipment and things that have metal. There’ll be great. They’ll make a great product. So Peter, I think you’re seeing a lot of that. Please. Well every time I do it, like for instance, I committed publicly that I wouldn’t take the $450,000 salary. It’s a lot of money. Whether you’re rich or not, it’s a lot of money and I did it. Nobody cared. Nobody said “Thank you.” Nobody said “Thank you very much.” Now, I didn’t commit legal. I just said, I don’t want it. I don’t want my salary. I work for zero. I don’t want my salary. Nobody said, “Oh, thank you very much,” but I guarantee you if I ever took it, you would go out after me. You in particular, would go out after me like crazy. So I have no idea what they’re talking about with regard to the one element. Everything’s changing, just so you understand. It’s all changing. But I have no idea.  But every time I commit to do something, I committed to do… Look, I ran and everybody knew I was a rich person. I built a great company and people knew that, but I agreed to do things I didn’t have to, I still don’t have to. But my company, I told the kids who are running it, I’m not running it. But I told them, “Don’t deal with foreign companies. Don’t deal.” I didn’t have to do that. I could’ve just ran and I didn’t have to do that at all. And instead of being thanked for, again not agreeing to do it, but just for not doing it, I get excoriated all the time. So I’ve learned, let’s just see what happens because we have to save some of these great companies that can be great companies literally in a matter of weeks. We have to save them. Yeah, please. Sure. Pete, go ahead. If we need them. I hope we don’t need them. I hope you’re going to have great luck on Tuesday morning. We sent a lot of the medicine, we don’t have to go into it again, but we sent a lot of the medicine to Governor Cuomo. I believe they already have it, and they have some very capable people. We spoke to Dr. Zucker who is his primary representative on this, and we spoke to the governor himself, and I think he’s excited about it like I’m excited about it. Now, will it work? I think it has a really good chance. I think it’s worthwhile. Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half when we have thousands of people that are very sick? They’re very, very sick. And we can use it on those people, and maybe make them better, and in some cases maybe saved their lives.  So Governor Cuomo told me they’ll be using their supply, starting their supply on Tuesday morning. I think it’s very exciting, I think because if that happens, much of what we’re talking about with ships and hospitals and all of the things that we’re doing, and all of these masks and everything that we’re ordering, ventilators, it’s a whole different game if that happens. And we’ll see. There’s been some tremendous signs that this could work. Now again, some doctors think it should go for years on testing, but this has been something that’s been around for many years. It’s been phenomenal, strong, powerful drug for malaria.  But we think it might work on this based on evidence, based on very strong evidence. We’re going to see, we’re going to know sometime after Tuesday. But you’ll have to ask Governor Cuomo, I think they’re going to start the process. We’ve gotten them the drug. I think they’re going to start the process of giving the drug through mouth. And I think that starts on Tuesday morning, he said. And that’ll be, I mean, I’ll tell you what. I don’t want to get anybody overly excited, but I’m very excited by that, by the prospect of it. Then in addition to that, NIH is working on vaccines and all. They’re making great progress, but the vaccine does have to be tested for a long period of time because you can’t give thousands millions of people a vaccine and it turns out to be dangerous. So that does have to be tested. But this one’s been taken for a long time, so we know pretty much one result. Yeah, please. Well, I don’t want to exactly say that. But I have spoken to president Xi about this, specifically about this. And look, he doesn’t want this, this is not something that he wants. And it happened, it happened to China. And one thing they told me, I was told by our great Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, that China’s been buying a lot of our farm product. And I’m looking at different pricing, but China has, despite all of this. And it started, this delayed it a little bit obviously, but it started fairly recently. But China is buying… We made a new deal as you know, with China, very big trade deal. And China has been buying our agricultural product. Yes. In fact, they are sending masks to Italy. We’re in a very good process with masks, but I’m a little upset with China, I’ll be honest with you. Because as much as I like president Xi and as much as I respect the country and and admire the country, I have great admiration for the country, what they’ve done in short period of time. Of course our presidents, our previous presidents allowed that to happen. You should say thank you very much to all of them, but they should have told us about this. And I did ask him whether or not we could send some people in, they didn’t want that, out of pride. I think really out of pride.  They don’t want us sending people into China to help them. China’s strong country. They have their scientists and they have their doctors. Very smart. A lot of people, but I did discuss that about sending our people in and they didn’t really respond. We went again, they didn’t respond. If they went in, they would have been able to tell us, give us a much earlier indication, but we had an early indication. That’s why I closed out China. I mean, I felt it was my instinct, but that’s why I closed out China at a very early time. Please. It’s really a fair question. I think I’ll let… Would you like to answer that question? Please, please. Surgeon General. Yes. I’ll answer that, and if that’s not the policy, I’ll make it the policy. And I was just saying as Mike was saying that the answer is, yes, we will do those tests, because I think in that case it’s important. I think that if you could say illegal alien, you could say illegal immigrant, you could say whatever you want to use your definition of what you’re talking about, we’re all talking about the same thing, yes, we will test that person. Because I think it’s important that we test that person and we don’t want to send that person back into wherever we’re going to be sending the person, whether it’s another country or someplace else because we’re now bringing them right out of our country. But yeah, we will test those people. Okay? Do you need a test? He better not. He better not. He wasn’t happy.  You know, everybody that knows Karen Pence, knows this, because the Vice President told me. He said, “She actually handled it better than him.” Right? That’s true, right? I didn’t handle so well either, don’t worry about it. Sure, with numerous countries. If they need help, we’ll give them help. There’s nobody has what we have, especially with the new tests that are coming out. North Korea, Iran by the way, and others, we are open for helping other countries and is a very serious time, and North Korea’s going through something. Iran is going through something very, very strong. Iran is really going through it, very difficult period with respect to this as you know. It’s really a glad hand. It’s all it is to North Korea, to Iran, and to many other countries, and we’re working with as the doctor can say, we’re working with many countries with respect to the problems that they have.  Again, it’s over 140 countries right now, but North Korea, Iran, and many other countries, we will help and we’re willing to, as an example, this new test. If this new test works at where instead of going through what we all went through with this rather difficult test, to put it nicely, is that just a swab on the tongue, doctor? How does that work? Not to the same . It doesn’t go all the way up and hangs a right under your eye. Right? It’s a tough test. So if we do that, the procedure, the test, and nobody has this in the world, nobody has this. This is developed by us. We think it’s going to be certified soon. We think it’s going to be very good. But if we have that, we’ll be able to help a lot of countries. We’re going to work with everybody and see if we can get something done. Please. Yeah, we’ll work with whoever we have to. We have to help the American worker. We have to help the countries from which the American workers, I mean, they came out of these companies. They were doing phenomenally well. You saw where payroll was going way up, where wages were going way, way up. There’s never been a time like this. We can’t lose those companies and we want the worker to be happy, and we’re being, I think, more generous than anybody’s ever been. We want to take care of the worker, but we want to make sure that when we win the war, it’s only a question of it’s when, not if, when we win the war against the virus, we want to make sure those companies that are ready to charge forward, not that they’d been disbanded because we were penny wise and dollar foolish. Well, we were asked that question a little while ago, and the answer is we may, but we may not need it. We do a very high standard. Our standard is higher. Please. We’re going to see what happens. Hopefully we won’t need it, but we might, but we’re going to see what happens. Look, the greatest thing we can do is win the war. The war is against the virus. That’s the war. We do that, everything, I really believe everything’s going to fall into place. It’s going to be beautiful. I call it a pent up demand. People are dying to go out to a restaurant. People are dying to go onto airplanes. I think there’s a tremendous pent up demand. You may be surprised to the degree. I think it’s going to go very rapidly because this wasn’t a financial crisis, just the opposite, this was a medical crisis. No. I don’t have stock. I own things. I didn’t even think about it. You know, it’s very interesting that you ask a question like that, nasty question and yet it deserves to be asked, I guess. What I’ve done by deciding to run, and I knew this, I knew this the first day. I said, “If I win, it’s going to cost a lot of money.” It cost me billions of dollars to become President, to be President of the United States. In things that would normally be run at a certain thing. Even people that don’t like me because they think I’m too tough on the border. Now some people love me for it. Other people don’t like me at all. You know, it’s very funny. My wife, we were at a charity event in New York City. I had just announced that I was running, and we were at the Robin Hood Foundation at the Convention Center, which now we’re going to be converting to hospitals for Governor Cuomo, and I was walking in and there was a smattering of booze and a smattering of cheers.  I was getting both. And our very popular first lady, she’s turned out to be very popular, people have great respect for, but our very popular first lady said to me, “Huh, that’s strange. I’ve never heard anybody booing you.” That was very early on, because I think I called for strong borders, or I called for something that other people don’t like, and I knew this would happen. I knew it was going to happen, but the fact that I ran, and I knew as soon as they announced, when I ran, I said, “It’s going to cost me a fortune, not only in terms of actual costs. Look at my legal costs. You people, everybody, everybody is suing me. I’m being sued by people that I never even heard of. I’m being sued all over the place and doing very well, but it’s unfair. But I’ll say this. In terms of running for President and I don’t think rich people, Michael Bloomberg spent now it’s determined almost a billion dollars and look what happened.  I think it’s very hard for rich people to run for office. It’s far more costly. It’s a very tough thing. Now, with all of that being said, I’m so glad I’ve done it because you know, there are a lot of rich people around, got a lot of rich friends, but they can’t help, and they can’t do what I’ve done in terms of helping this country. We are doing things. We got sidetracked by the invisible enemy. But you know what? When you look at what we’ve done, I said before with the veterans, with all of the things we’ve done, especially choice, but when you look at all of accountability, when you look at all of the things that we’ve done, rebuilding the military, the tax cuts, which thank goodness we had the tax cuts because we had cushion.  Oh, and without that, this would have been catastrophic. We had a big cushion. I mean with all of the losses that you’ve seen in the stock market, we’re basically back, and with this horrible thing. If this would’ve happened before, you would have had nothing left. This was all cushion. But I will say that it costs me billions of dollars to be President. And especially with all the money I could have made for the last three, four years, and I didn’t because I was being President. I have no interest in it. I’m allowed to. I don’t know if you know. George Washington, they say he was a rich man supposedly, relatively rich, and he ran the presidency and he also ran his business. They say he had two desks. Nobody complained until I came along. I got elected as a rich person, but nobody complained until I came along.  So it cost me billions of dollars to be President, and I am so happy I did it because who cares? Who cares? I’m really happy with the job we’re doing, and I’m glad that this team and me are here for this horrible thing. I mean, a number of people have said it, and I feel it actually. I’m a wartime President. This is a war. This is a war, different kind of a war that we’ve ever had. And when you look at the economics of the war, in the past, we used to stimulate to get people jobs. Now we’re stimulating to protect people because we don’t want them to work because we want them to stay away from each other. We don’t want them to gather social, social gathering. So we’re paying billions of dollars, more than that, so that they don’t gather, because we have to defeat this virus and we will. But it cost me billions and billions of dollars to be President, and I am so happy I did it. Well, we do help foreign countries. That was the other question and I’m honored to help and the doctor has helped. The Surgeon General is speaking to other countries all the time. They’re asking him questions, what do we do? Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. They’re calling our people all of the time and yes, I have let it be known that we’ll help people, including North Korea, including Iran, and including many other countries. It’s very important to do this. So no, not in the stimulus bill, but we are very much, I mean, we give away billions of dollars for, as an example, AIDS in Africa. We’re still fighting that battle. It’s a tremendous battle, tremendous war also, but we’re fighting it here. As you know, in 10 years, now it’s eight years because I started it. It should have been started long before I got here because they had the answer even before, but we’re fighting that battle. We’ll be AIDS free in approximately eight years. It looks like that is going to happen. We’re spending a lot of money, but we’re spending a lot of money with other countries. If you look at the aid that we give to other countries, we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries, and a lot of times I say, “You know, we could save a lot of money. We shouldn’t have,” and then they come in. I say, “What’s it used for?”  It’s used to fight malaria in countries that are very poor. It’s used to fight AIDS in Africa. It’s used to fight many other things, many other things. And I don’t think I’ve ever said, “No, I can’t.” It’s just so terrible. Countries that we have, really, we’re not involved with them very much other than there would be tremendous death, tremendous death. I mean, you can get a list and I could get you a list. We give away billions of dollars to other countries, and we are giving away a lot in terms of everything, and probably we’ll end up doing economically doing something for other countries. But when I’m presented with these lists, that yes sir, in Africa, we’re fighting AIDS, or fighting something else. I tell you what, I start off by saying, “You know, we should say we could save a lot of money,” and then by the time they walk those lists into my office, I say, “We have to keep doing that.” That’s humanity you’re talking. How about one more question? Yes. Well, states have to go, that’s a great Governor. You’re talking about Greg Abbott in Texas, and he’s a great Governor, and he knows what he’s doing. A lot of the areas that he’s talking about, a lot of the counties he’s talking about are not very strongly affected. It’s a very different kind of a place and a great place, but I have total confidence in Governor Greg Abbott. Yeah, sure, because every state is different. Every state is different. I mean, Idaho, West Virginia, Iowa, Nebraska are much different than New York, than California, Los Angeles as an example, or San Francisco, they’re much different. I mean, it’s much different. The hotspots right now are state of Washington, and probably number one by far right now is New York. That’s the hotspot like no other hotspot, and California’s a hotspot. But New York right now is the leader. There’s no question. All right, final question. Well, that’s a lawsuit coming out of Texas again, that was headed up by Texas, and what we want to do is get rid of the bad healthcare and put in a great healthcare, and we will always, I will say this, I can make this commitment to you, the Republican party is fully backing preexisting conditions. Now, if we could get a great healthcare plan, which would need the House to do, but if we can get a great healthcare plan, we will only do it if we have preexisting conditions totally backed. So we’re back in preexisting, but we’d like to get rid of bad health healthcare. Now, we are running the bad healthcare much better than it was ever run and we’re making it better. But it could be much better than it is. And so what we want to do is terminate it, have a great healthcare, but we will only do it with preexisting. We will back preexisting conditions. Thank you all very much. Thank you. We’ll be back. We’ll have a meeting tomorrow. .  Oh, did it take? I watched Jose on NBC the other night. Okay."
"Well, thank you very much, and I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here. This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that’s fine, that’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad. We extend our best wishes to the person affected and we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon.  Thank you for being here. America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus. I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge, the hardship will end, it will end soon, normal life will return and our economy will rebound very, very strongly, but right now in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory. To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives many, many lives.  It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They’re working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together. It’s very important. From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus. Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time. We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay, meaning the okay to get going, to get back “Let’s go to work.”  Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down. My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers, and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had. If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks. In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before and we’re doing things to help in that regard. America will again, and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.  We can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. At the end of the 15 day period we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing, and essentially we’re referring to the timing of the opening, essentially the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.  Two weeks ago we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave, and approved $8 billion including money for the development of treatments and vaccines, and we’re doing tremendous work in both, on both fronts. The vaccines are coming along very quickly. Now, Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written and avoid playing anymore partisan games. They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics, and I think that’s happening. I got a call a little while ago, I guess they’re getting closer. It should go quickly, and it must go quickly. It’s not really choice. They don’t have a choice, they have to make a deal. This should not be a time for political agendas, but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people. We are going to save American workers and we’re going to save them quickly, and we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large. This was a medical problem, we are not going to let it turn into a long lasting financial problem.  It started out as a purely medical problem and it’s not going to go beyond that. We’re just not going to allow that to happen. Our country was at its strongest financial point, we’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got a hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible, and we are fixing it. We’re fixing it quickly, and I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing. Our country will be stronger than ever before and we fully anticipate that, and it won’t be that long.  Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies. FEMA is distributing 8,000,095 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need. We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the state of Washington. In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks. We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment which we will be distributing to medical hotspots. We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation. We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community and members of the private sector really working together. Everybody’s working together.  I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus. At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of flororoquin, and you can look from any standpoint tomorrow in New York, we think tomorrow pretty early. The hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination probably is looking very, very good and it’s going to be distributed. We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow. It’ll be available, and it is now. They already have it. They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York. We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely. You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman, they thought he was not going to make it, he said goodbye to his family, they had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die, and a number of hours later he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again and he felt really good, and he’s in good shape, and he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record setting time.  There’s never been anything even close to it, and I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn, Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man, but they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs, not only this drug but also others that are coming. Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron, a couple of others are also under study, but the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned, and I think there’s a real chance, I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact. It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game changer, so we’ll see, but distribution starts tomorrow morning early in New York and I think a lot of people are going to be, hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result, but we’re all going to be watching closely. It’s something we have to try. It’s been very, very successful on Malaria, very, very successful, and countries with Malaria have had an interesting thing happen. They take this particular drug, it’s a very powerful drug, and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries, and there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the Malaria, so we’ll see what happens.  I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements at a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing. We do want to require people to go with their local DMV. We will be announcing the new deadline very soon. It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.  Over night, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil following a cruise. We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great president. Most of those returned were senior citizens. My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector coordinated their safe return to the United States, so thank you to Governor Abbott, a terrific governor, terrific man.  Earlier today I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 45-12 of the Defense Production act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks and personal protective equipment. We have a lot of face masks, a lot of equipment just coming in, and we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr’s going to be speaking about that in a second. We want to prevent price gouging and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form. Under this directive the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce, so he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree we think, but nevertheless, it’s happening. We can’t let it happen, and we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing. Very simply, will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit, so we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely.  The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic. Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine, if you can believe that one. As president, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited. Thankfully, all throughout the country we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence and unity. Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands, manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines, citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly, we’re truly seeing America at its best. We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen. Frankly, we never thought this could happen, but the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible. It’s been incredible.  I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible, and thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders. These are very brave people. Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines. We thank you very much. Great job. We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed. So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible. They’re doing a service where people come and they pick it up, delivery. It’s been incredible what they’ve been doing. A totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food. Other than that, it’s like a totally different business.  Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace and grit. From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness, and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character. It’s really being shown. It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting. All over the world, they’re respecting, and the world has problems. We’re 148 countries now. 148 countries are affected by the invisible scourge, and all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see. Together, we will care for our fellow citizens and we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think and we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon. You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon.  Now, I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words, and we’ll take questions in a little while. Thank you. Thank you very much, .  Deborah? Deborah, please. Thank you very much, Deborah. . Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Of course I do. It’s going to be bad and we have a lot of people dying from the flu. As you know, we have a very bad flu season on top of everything else. It’s very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000, and certainly this is going to be bad. We’re trying to make it so that it’s much, much less bad and that’s what we’re doing. I think we’re doing a very good job of it.  If you look at other countries, what they’ve been through, and you look at the kind of numbers and compare them to ours, which is a much larger country than most, the numbers are pretty amazing. And it started with the fact that we stopped people from coming in from a highly infected area and that was a good thing to do. So yeah, it’s bad and obviously the numbers are going to increase with time, and then they’re going to start to decrease.  And we’re going to be opening our country up for business because our country was meant to be open and working with others but especially for our workers. And the engine for that whole system is we have to have companies and these companies are loved by our workers because they’re paying big salaries and big dollars to our workers. And we’re going to get it all going again very soon, hopefully very, very soon.  Please. Well, you’ll see what happens. I understand the question very well. It’s a great question, but we can do two things at one time. I will say this, our country’s learned a lot. We’ve learned about social distancing. We’ve learned about the hands, we’ve learned about staying away at least during the time that this is even a little bit around this disease or whatever you want to call it. Many different names, you can go up many different names, but the virus while it’s around.  And we can start thinking about, as an example, parts of our country are very lightly effected, very small numbers. You look at a state, great governor, Pete Ricketts in Nebraska. You look at the kind of numbers they have out there. They have one of the great hospitals there too, relative to what we’re talking about. But you look at Nebraska, you look at Idaho, you look at Iowa. I could name many countries that are handling it very, very well and that are not affected to the same extent or frankly not even nearly to the extent of New York. I’m dealing with the Governor Cuomo and we’re dealing very well together. We’ll be sending that ship up, by the way, as you know. We have a ship going to Los Angeles. The ship is coming out of a very large repair, so ready to go or very soon will be. And over the next three or four weeks that’ll be coming up to New York. We’ll go to New York Harbor and it’ll be fully supplied, so they’re working on that right now. Well, I didn’t say a week, but I said soon. It’s going to be a soon. It’s not going to be three or four months as some people were saying and a lot of people thought originally, but I would certainly let you answer. I think that’s a great definition, and I will say we’re going to be watching our senior citizens very closely. We’re going to be watching certain hotspots like New York, and within New York you have areas which are troubling and we’ll be working with the governor and the mayor and everybody else on those spots.  But at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers. We want to take care of our workers, so we’ll be doing something I think relatively quickly, but we’ve learned a lot during this period. This was a very necessary period. Tremendous information was gained, but we can do two things at one time.  And again, I say, we have a very active flu season, more active than most. It’s looking like it’s heading to 50,000 or more deaths, deaths not cases. 50,000 deaths, that’s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we’re talking about. That doesn’t mean we’re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. We have to do things to get our country open. But this has been an incredible period of learning and we’ll have announcements over the next fairly short period as to the timing. John, please. Yeah. I’ll let you answer him. Uh-oh. Whew. Thank you for saying that. Thank you very much. Well, they will be in place. At some point, we’re going to open up our country and it’s going to be fairly soon. I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now. We’re going to be opening up our country and we’re going to be watching certain areas and we’re going to be practicing everything that Deborah is referring to right here. I mean, we’re going to be watching this very closely, but you can’t keep it closed for years, okay.  This is going away. We’re going to win the battle, but you have tremendous responsibility. We have jobs. We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this. When you have terrible economies, you have death probably, and I mean definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus. We have an obligation. We have a double obligation.  We have a great country. There is no country like it in the world and there’s no economy like it in the world. I mean, we were just blazing. We were coming out with numbers that some numbers weren’t even reported because this had happened. They were meaningless. I got numbers about myself that were meaningless. Because by the time the numbers came in, it’s a whole different world with this.  But I will tell you that we can do both things, John. We can do them both at the same time. I mean, that’s okay. What we have gone through is a tremendous learning process and we’ve also solved a lot of problems. But we’ve gone through a tremendous learning situation. Now, we’re building hospitals in New York. We’re building hospitals in California. We’re building hospitals in the state of Washington. We’ve been in touch with the governors. Today I spoke with a man that I happened to like. I spoke with Phil in New Jersey and where we’re going to be doing something very meaningful in New Jersey. We’re doing something… I spoke with, JB Pritzker called me today. We’re going to be helping them out in Illinois. We’re doing a lot of things in Florida.  We’re doing a lot of things between FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Admiral in your group in terms of the purchasing, that’s what he does. He purchases. He supposed to be great. I’ll tell you in about two days, but he’s going to do a fantastic job. We have an incredibly talented group of people. But yeah, we’ll be doing two things and three things at one time.  Well, at the same time though, we’re going to be watching very closely the hotspots. We’re going to be taking care and watching very closely our senior citizens, especially those with a problem or an illness. We’re going to be watching them very, very closely; and we can do that and have an open economy, have an open country. And we have to do that because that causes other problems and maybe it causes much bigger problems than the problem we’re talking about now. You understand. Jeff, please. I think the cure has been very tough. This has been very tough. This was an operation. This was somebody going to a doctor and saying, “You need an operation,” and we’ve had an operation. We’ve learned a lot and we fixed a lot of problems. One of the things we fixed is if you look at the absolute system that this administration inherited, it wasn’t meant for this. It was meant for a small group of people; and even for that, it was not very good and very obsolete.  We have a testing program now that will hopefully be able to be used for many years into the future should we have another event like this. I don’t think you’ll have another event like this. This is very unique. You look back into time, you look back decades and decades. We can name them all. Even if you go back 10 years, you know you go back to ’09, but that wasn’t like this as it turned out. But they lost a lot of people. We were early. We were early,, Jeff because of the fact that we closed early. That was a big move. Please, . Yeah, go ahead, Jim. Well, it’s not change. No, we’re doing things… Yeah. This was a learning experience for the people of the country. If what’s changed? Well, I think we’ve learned a lot. I think that there’s so much discipline now that we never had. Nobody ever said don’t shake hands. I did actually before I became a politician. Once I became a politician then it’s hard getting used to not doing it because you do it with everybody. With literally thousands of people a week, you’re shaking hands with big groups of people.  We’ve learned a lot. There’s a great discipline that this whole country has learned having to do with distancing, having to do with shaking hands. I think a lot of it’s going to stay long after the viruses go and I really think it’s probably good practice anyway, but I think it’s going to stay long after the virus has gone.  We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems, far bigger. Look, this is a severe medical situation that could cause problems far beyond the medical, and then increase the medical problems to things that had nothing to do with this original medical problem. We can’t let that happen to our country. We have the greatest country in the world. I’m not going to let that happen, but this two weeks that we have spent, has been an incredible learning period and process. Please, Kristin. I spoke to them today and I was telling them that we have two things to look forward. Don’t forget the doctors, if it were up to the doctors, they may say let’s keep it shut down. Let’s shut down the entire world. Because, again, you’re up to almost 150 countries, so let’s shut down the entire world. And when we shut it down, that would be wonderful and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years. You know you can’t do that and you can’t do that with a country, especially the number one economy anywhere in the world by far. Number one economy in the world, you can’t do that. Well, it causes bigger problems than the original. That’s why I talk about the cure being worse than the problem. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem. But what we have done… So this is not retracing, this isn’t anything. We’ve done it really well because this two-week period has been good and I’m not saying it ends at that time. We have another seven days or so. I’m not saying it ends at that time, but I am saying it’s been this incredible learning process. That’s going to go into the future. That’s going to go even as we open up our country. And we’re going to be watching New York and we’re going to be watching California, we’re going to be watching the state of Washington and other places. Illinois is becoming a hotspot, and we can do both.  Now, we may quarantine… I mean we will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected or they’re affected very little. And why would we close down 100% of the country? There are areas within New York where New York will be open, but there are areas within New York. Remember this, New York has the New York Stock Exchange. It has NASDAQ, it has the exchanges. To close the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ with all of the great work they’re doing. I mean, they’ve gone largely to computer. You look at the floor, it’s incredible what they can do, but it’s fully open. But we don’t want to be doing that.  What I’m saying basically is that we can do two things simultaneously, and we’ve had this incredible learning period. Plus, people have been in a period and they won’t be calling, “Oh gee.” Because I’ve got many, many people that now come to me and say, “We get it. We think we can really do it now and do it while we’re open.” So at some point, we’ll be setting some guidelines, we’ll be setting some datelines and we’ll be announcing them in the not too distant future. Well, not endorsed. We talked together, and I think they’re okay with it and I’m okay with it, but this could be a much bigger problem. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with. Now other nations are going to have to do what they’re going to do, but they’ll probably do something very similar.  But in our case, much more so than anyone else, because of the magnitude of our economy, the tremendous size of what we’ve built and what we have and the jobs involved. You have almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far the most ever. The number of jobs, almost 160 million, so we can’t turn that off and think it’s going to be wonderful. They’ll be tremendous repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that, death. You’re talking about death.  Death from the death, you’re talking about death. Probably more death from that than anything that we’re talking about with respect to the virus. No, I think we’re going to do them both. I think that’s what I’m saying. I think we can do them both now. Now, we haven’t announced a date, but we’re getting fairly close to coming up with a date and it’s a much shorter period of time than I’ve been hearing the news report. And I think everybody should be happy with that, but great knowledge was gained. Please. You mean with the Democrats you’re talking about? Well, it is true. If he said… I didn’t hear him say that, but if he said, “Difficult trade-offs,” sure. It’s less convenient. Before you walk and you’d hop in the subway and you had grab the handle and you go down to wherever you’re going on Wall Street and you do all sorts of things and you go in and you open the doors going into your great buildings or into the exchanges and now you’re not going to have to… Maybe you think about doing that or you’re going to think about doing it a different way.  No, no. There are many trade-offs. It’s a different life and maybe it will remain that way frankly after the invisible scourge is gone. Maybe it’s going to say that way. Not a bad thing to stay that way, but no, there are trade-offs. There’s no question about that, but I actually think it’s going to… I think in the end we’re going to end up being bigger, better and stronger. We have learned a lot. Please. That’s true. Latin America. No, we’re not really. Something like that could happen, I guess, but we’re not really. They thought we were going to have bans within the United States. We didn’t do that. We’re not going to have that. Hopefully that’ll take care of itself. No ones, in Latin America, there is a, there’s been an uptick. Yeah, please. Yeah, because it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen. I just wanted to make that point. Because they’re blaming China- People are blaming China. And they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen. Please. Yeah, the governors of the various states will have a lot of leeway. If we open up, and when we open up, the governors in certain states. For instance, you go to some of the states I just mentioned, those schools are going to be open. Many cases, they’re open now, but the schools are going to be open. In other cases, Governor Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, of California, certain governors are going to maybe have a decision to make. Now, they may make a decision to keep them open in a certain part of New York and maybe in Westchester County or wherever it may be, they’ll keep them closed.  But they’re going to have leeway. We giving the governors a lot of leeway. The governors are going to make those decisions. That’s going to be up to the governors and they’re very capable. They’ll be able to make the decisions. Please. Because the virus has had a big impact on our country, so we’re going to give a stimulus so that the workers can live their life. It was not their fault, it wasn’t the workers’ fault. And we are going to give a kick, so that it’s a kick. And this way we think the workers can get a fair start. The small businesses, we’re taking very good care of, we want to take care of these small businesses. They really are the engine of this country. A lot of people don’t know that. Everyone thinks of these great, big, beautiful businesses, who by the way have been very badly hurt also.  But the small businesses have really, historically been the engine and they still are the engine of the country. And you’d be amazed. The workers love those businesses and the workers contact us and they want us to help those businesses because that’s where they’ve made their living.  That’s where they’ve been paid a lot of money over the years. And you’ve been seeing what’s happened over the last three years, where salaries and wages have gone up very substantially for those workers. And then, we got caught by this sudden craziness coming into our country and coming all over the world. We need to make sure that the companies are strong and that the workers are strong and that’s what we’re doing. And hopefully, the Republicans and Democrats are going to be able to make a deal and they’re actually fairly close. But we’ll see what happens. Please. Well, one of the things you’re going to have to save companies that have been shattered. You’re going to have to save a various, I mean, you know a lot of the companies yourselves, we have a company that was I think the greatest company in the world named Boeing. Boeing is going to need some help. Now, Boeing had some difficulty before. That’s unlike others. We have other companies that didn’t have a problem coming in. Boeing had the obvious problem that everybody knows about from a little more than a year ago, a double problem, and it was a big one.  And then on top of it, as they’re getting ready to really show their stuff on top of it, we all get hit by this and obviously the airlines are going to have a problem, but the airlines aren’t going to be buying from Boeing or from anybody else right now because of this difficulty. We have to work with the airlines, we have to work with the cruise lines. We have to work with the companies like a Boeing because Boeing’s a potentially, again, a great company. Had a very rough period of 13 months, a very rough period, a horrible period. An unbelievable period.  If you would’ve told me this would have happened to Boeing, I wouldn’t have believed it. Because to me it was truly one of the great, one of the truly great, probably almost one point of GDP if you can think of that’s hard to believe, that a company could have that kind of an impact. But Boeing, we have to work with it for two reasons.  Number one, it’s a great company that we have to save. Number two, it produces unbelievable numbers of jobs. And so, the numbers have to be reflective of that kind of a thing. Please. You know what I’m going to do? We have wonderful people behind us that are working very hard and we want Bill to get back to the Department of Justice, so we want the admiral to start going and doing your job. And the same thing with Deb. If anybody would have any questions, maybe I’ll ask Mike to stay around, but if anybody would have any questions for the group and otherwise I’ll let them get back to work. Please. Go ahead, please. We have some, it should be fairly quick. I have a question for you. We have a lot of very angry media all around this room and they want one of these seats, but because of social distancing, we are keeping them empty and they are keeping them empty. Will there ever be a time when all of those really angry, angry people who don’t like me much to start off with, but now they really don’t like me, will there ever be a time when these seats are full, like full to the brim like it used to be where people are almost sitting on each other’s lap?  And this whole row over here is packed and now they’re outside wanting to get in and they’re very jealous of all of these reporters. Will we ever have that again? Or is that something that will be, you know, it’ll look like this forever? Right? But when the virus is gone, will the people be allowed to sit next to each other again, in your opinion in a tight room with a tight? Yup, you’re doing it. And I think the big factor is the mortality rate, we’re talking about about the mortality rate. When we first started, people were thinking about three and 4% and now we’re talking about a much lower number than that. I think it’s a- I think it’s a number that will be a lot different than people thought. . It’s much lower than we originally thought. I mean, frankly- It’s a lot lower. Doctor, it’s just very interesting. The whole thing. It’s an incredible subject. When somebody is very sick, they go to a doctor, go to a hospital, they’re recorded, they’re very sick, and then they live or they don’t live, see what happens. But when somebody isn’t very sick at all, I’ve heard people that they don’t even know they had it and they’re healing. Then I’ve heard people that have like a cold or they have a running nose or even people that stay home and they think they have the flu, or in some cases they think they have a really bad case of the flu.  But all of those people, that vast majority of, I mean beyond vast majority of people, they’re not reporting. They’re not calling the doctor, they’re not calling them. They’re just getting better. You would think it would have to be because the people that are sick are going to a doctor or they’re going someplace, and they’re going to say, “Make me better.” The people that are just short of that and people that aren’t even, I mean, we have many people where they literally don’t even know that they have it. Now, you’re building up the number of cases that we talked about before and yet, so you don’t know any what, you don’t know how many they are. . It could be a vast number. But what you do know is all the people that are really sick.  Because all of the people that are really sick are going to a doctor in some form. And the doctor is reporting it in all cases itself. I’m talking about many forms. We’re talking about… Look, number one, it’s the country itself. You’re talking tremendous disruption economically, but you’re talking about massive depression, massive numbers of suicide- No, I’m talking about, no, I’m not talking about economic. Although, you could be talking about that, too. What I’m talking about is people suffering massive depression because they had a fantastic job and now they have no idea what’s going on. Now, here’s the good news. If they get the bill passed, we’re taking care of those people. We’re going to really take good care of those people beyond what any country has done for people. But there’s never been anything like this.  No. I’m talking about where people suffer massive depression,, where people commit suicide, where tremendous death happens. Now in addition to that, we’re talking about economic where you really hurt a country. It could take years and years to recover. And the longer you stay out, the harder it is to recover. I happen to think that you’re going to have, they call it the V, I think you’re going to have a very big bounce, you know, a very big bounce back. I think it’s going to be very big. We’ll see. Well, I think the bill should pass. It’s should pass quickly. Take care of our workers, take care of the companies that pay those workers, help those companies over this rough patch. But the longer it takes, the harder it is to come back. I’d like to be able to bounce back to where we were. And ultimately I think we’re going to be even further than that. But I’m just saying that the… What’s happening when I say the cure and the cure could be worse than the problem itself. Right? That’s what I, we can’t let that happen. We can’t let that happen.  We’ve learned so much and so many good things are going to happen for our country. We can’t let this continue to go on. What we’re doing is we’re meeting with the doctors, Dr.Fauci, Dr. Birx and others and we’re, we’ve already started the discussion. And I can say that I’m a student like you’re students. We’re all learning this together. I learned a lot from Deborah. I learned a lot from Tony.  I learned a lot from a lot of people that this is, this has been their life’s work. I’ve learned a lot. We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things. We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant. We’re going to be so vigilant in terms of all of the things that we have to do that we’ve been talking about for the last two weeks ad nauseum. And I think it’s going to be ultimately a far better solution for our country. Yeah, please go ahead.  want her to go back and you want her to go back to work. Immediately. Thank you. Great job. Thank you, Deborah. Yeah, Deborah? They won’t let you go. Thank you. Go ahead, one second, please. Well, it is. It’s something we’re talking to a lot of people about. We’ll see what happens, but we’re talking to people about it. Go ahead, please. Let me just, I was just with him for a long time. And- Oh, he’s at the task force meeting right now. We have a task force meeting. He was there. Well, he doesn’t not agree. I mean, we had a long talk and he understands this tremendous, there’s a tremendous cost to our country, both in terms of lives and in terms of economics and in terms of many, many years of rebuilding something that was a fine tuned machine. It was nobody’s fault. It just happened. This horrible virus came from wherever and it just happened. It just happened. He fully understands that now. He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand.  No, he’s not here because we really weren’t discussing what he’s best at, but he’ll be back up very soon. Yeah, please. And we’ll be discussing dates and times with him. And we are talking about a… I don’t want to use the word abbreviated because so much has been gained by what we’ve done. But we’re talking about not during the period, you know, during the 14 or 15 days, but not too long after that- Which, I think is going to make a lot of people happy. It’s going to make a lot of companies happy. It’s going to make a lot of workers happy. Yeah, John? I would certainly, he’s very important to me and I would, I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to Deborah, who you just spoke to. I’ll be listening to other experts. We have a lot of people that are very good at this, and ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but-  Ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but the expression, we can do two things at one time and we’ve got an incredible country. We have to keep it that way and that includes not just economics, that also includes life and death. We have to keep it that way. Well, I’ve gotten to like this room. This room is very convenient. I can say from the standpoint of being president of the United States I really… This has been a very convenient room for all of us. You people are set up, so I never even thought of closing it. So you’re asking me a question that I never thought in terms of closing it. Can you give me a good reason to close it? We could build a larger one. I don’t want to make commitments like that because it’s not something I’ve ever really thought about. There are certain people that would like to see a larger room built. We need a larger room. Other presidents didn’t need such a large room, but we need a larger room and there are some people, but it’s not something that is really on my mind to be honest with you. Yes, please. Which period? I think we’re listening to many people. I mean that was my world. I know many of those people. I have many people that are friends of mine, some enemies also by the way. But it’s been a good world for me. I like that world. I like those people. They’re tough and they’re smart. But I listened to many of them. Ultimately, they all go into that computer and I say, this is what we’re going to do. I have to make a decision. This is a very important man right here to my right, our great vice president, because he’s got a great instinct about things too. So I’m going to be listening to my case, headed up the task force I think brilliantly. I think it’s going to go down as that because he’s really done a job. Not only has he been good, he’s been soothing. He’s really been great for the American public to watch it.  I mean that in the most positive way. There’s a solidity with Mike that you don’t find in many people. He’s been soothing. He’s been good for the American public. They have confidence in him. I think he’s done an incredible job and his advice is very, very important to me. So he’s going to be making… I mean, he didn’t come from that world, the world of finance, but he understands the world of finance. He was a great governor in Indiana. They did very well financially too. I can give you a whole list and we’ll probably even set up committees. I’d rather give you one because then I’m going to leave out… I have spoken to so many people and- What? I am happy with him. Yes. I think he’s… I really think he’s a caught up and he’s done the right thing and I think ultimately we will be rewarded because of the decision he made over the last… He’s really stepped up over the last week and I have to tell you, I called him today and I said, Jerome, good job. You really did it . It might be, he was just a little bit slower than I would have liked in the sense of what he was doing. Now, other people might have liked it, but today I called up Jerome Powell and I said, “Jerome, you’ve done a really good job.” I was proud of him. That took courage and ultimately you’re going to see the fruits. Now. He’s not finished. I mean, he’s got other arrows in the quiver or whatever they say, I will tell you he’s got plenty of arrows. But no, I’m very happy with the job he did. No wait, I just want to say, we’re thinking about it. China has very much stepped up as you probably know, the agricultural purchases from our farmers and some other purchases too. So they have a difficult time also right now. But they’ve very much stepped up their purchases and significantly. So we’re very happy about that. The other thing, I’m standing here, this case with our vice president trying to let you ask anything you want having to do with the subject, which frankly is pretty much all anyone cares about right now. Because I think it’s very important. I don’t want to stand here for two hours and do this, but I think it’s important that I call it get it out of your system. Give us any question about it because I think it’s important for the public to know. So we don’t want to answer two questions and leave. We want to answer your questions.  That’s why we’re doing this for so long. I think it gives our country confidence and it gives… I think we’re all gaining knowledge. This has been an unbelievable process, but we’re all getting… So I want to stay here. Sometimes we’re here for two hours and we’re answering questions. At least you will say that I’m very transparent. I think you’re going to have a hard time saying he is not transparent. But we take a lot of questions from you. Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions. Some of these questions are great. Some of the questions lead to us solving a problem. You bring up problems that people didn’t know existed. But I just want to let you know so we’re doing this so that we can be transparent so that we can get everything out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. We’re very, very close to them. We had a couple of great talks plus I’ve spoken to a number of them individually. Yeah, we’re very, very closely aligned. Please. That’s going to make a big difference because that really is a process that’s easy as opposed to the current process, which is not, as I’ve said, it’s not pleasant. Yeah. Then ultimately I have to make a decision, but I certainly listened to them. I listened to a number of people. I have a lot of respect for Dr. Fauci and for Dr. Birx and I’ll be listening to them and others that we have that are really doing good. John. We have now a system and the systems in place and we have two very, very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration. And as I said, one of the things that has really gotten me thinking about this, number one, I’m looking at what’s going on and you know it’s life is fragile and economies are fragile, but one of the things is the mortality rate, John. When we first started this, nobody knew anything about this particular virus. Very, very little. I mean we started, if we were hearing numbers of 5% that would, that’s an astronomical number when the flu is 0.001 and two and three, right? So 5% would be an astronomical number. Now we’re seeing numbers that may be less than one and that’s not including the exercise that I just went through where many people don’t report. So everybody getting very sick is reporting, but nobody getting not very sick.  That should be part of that equation. So that just keeps reducing the number. So the mortality rate, that’s a big… To me that’s a very big factor. When we were hearing three and 4%, remember we had one day where we thought it was 5% and we’re getting a lot of bad numbers from countries that, I don’t know why, but we were getting a lot of bad numbers. I do wish, again, our relationship’s very good with China, but I wished they could have told us about this a little bit sooner. You know that. But the mortality rate is a big thing for me because I think we’re very substantially under 1% now. It’s still terrible. It’s still the whole thing. The whole concept of death is terrible, but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and four or five or even 3%. So that’s something that we’re learning now. I think the number may be lower than people think because of what I’ve been saying. Yeah, please. Well, I thought we had a deal last night and then the Democrats changed the deal. So we had a deal last night that was going to be phenomenal for the workers, which is my number one aim. I want to take care of the workers and we had a deal. I was pretty sure we had a deal last night if you would told me at a certain time about 9:00 I would have told you we pretty much have a deal. And then all of a sudden it changed. It changed fairly rapidly. It was unaccepted. It would have been bad for our country and they were asking for things that would have not been good. I mean things that that bore no relationship to what we’re talking about and we said that’s not the game. We can’t play that game. So we’ll see. Look, the Democrats do want to make a deal. But Jeff, I thought we had a deal last night. I’ll work with anybody to help the American people. I will. I don’t care who it is. I’ll work with anybody. If I feel I’m going to help the American people and the American worker. Yeah, please. Well, you just saw the Admiral and you just saw the FEMA people and you just saw the army corps of engineers. We’re building hospitals in New York and California and State of Washington and New Jersey. I just made a commitment to fill that we’re going to help him out with some of the areas in New Jersey, which is very important, a great state. So, we’re doing a great job and with it to help the governors, but the governors are on the front line and they can do some of it themselves. Governor Cuomo, he’s been working very hard and he worked with me on the hospitals and medical centers because it’s not just hospitals, it’s called hospital and another is medical centers of which we’re building numerous for New York. We have it all laid out. We have Javits center and then we have other locations throughout the state.  I think it’s really a great plan and we’re going to have FEMA and the army corps of engineers involved. I’ve worked with them we’re building a wall. We’re up to over 150 miles of wall on our Southern border, which is now turning out to be even more important than we originally thought. But I always thought it was very important having borders. So, I’m working with the army corps of engineers and I see what they do and how they do it. That’s used to be my business. I know it very well and they’re very professional. They’re really good.  So you’re going to see a lot of good things happening in many States beyond the States. I just mentioned in many States, we’re working with governor Ron DeSantis in Florida. We’re working with governor McMaster, right? In South Carolina where they have a little bit of a breakout, not by comparison but a little bit. We’re working with many, many governors and many, many states. Actually States where you almost would think that they have it under pretty good control and they’ve done a great job, but we’re working with many states and that’s primarily FEMA and the army corps of engineer. They’re capable of doing it. Well, a lot of the provisions that they wanted, like stock buy backs. I agree with it. That’s good with me. I mean, I don’t like them buying back stock. I like them spending money on airplanes and on their employees and they real business, not buying back stock. I don’t know if that provision is going to be put in one way or the other. But I’m all for it and many Republicans, I can tell you are for it and I think many Democrats are for it. But they were putting that out like it was a problem last night. Not a problem for me, I can tell you that, please. Well, I think when you’re talking about right now is at least $3,000 per family of four in that correct. $3,000 for a family of four, which is bold. If this continued, we have to build this up and if this continued we’ll do something else and we’ll do more at a later date. But that’s a big number. If you remember, they were talking about $500 and $600 and we are all for the three. As of this moment, it’s $3,000 for a family of four. Please go ahead. Well, we have a very strong dollar and a strong dollar is good in many ways, but it’s also tough in many ways because it makes trade much harder. It makes it much harder for a Caterpillar tractor and other companies to sell their goods to Europe or China or wherever they may be sold. So having a strong dollar is good, but it really sounds good. But the truth is it makes certain things like trade much tougher. Our dollar, I don’t know if you’ve seen, but our dollars have been very strong, especially against other currencies, very, very strong. Which again, makes that trading more difficult. But there’s something nice about having a strong dollar, right? No matter what, I’m president, I used to have a strong dollar, but it does make trading more different. Well, I think the Democrats want a deal and I think we want to deal. So it would be very foolish if they didn’t make a deal. The American public is demanding it. I can tell you the Republicans want to make a deal and we want to make a deal that’s good for the workers, good for the country. I really believe the Democrats want to make a deal, but they have to stop asking for things that bear no relationship to what we’re talking about. That are actually bad. That are actually not good for the country. Well, let’s see what happens. I have to see what happens. Right now we don’t have a deal, but I think we’re very close. I mean, when I left, which was quite a while ago now, because again, we’re trying to answer every question so there’s no… Be nice if you were just exhausted and said, “That’s it. We can’t do any more.” But there’s always hands up. Maybe one of those questions is great and unique, but now look I want what’s good for the country and if that means meeting, I think that’s great. I just want what’s good for the country, great for our workers, great for the citizens of the United States. That’s all it - It’s been a little. Yeah, please. Yes. She’s great. She’s fine. Negative. Well, we need that to help all of these companies that have a chance of not being companies anymore, and that’s going to be a good thing for the country because deals will be made and we’re talking to certain people. Some of the greatest people in the history of Wall Street, frankly. Where when they do a deal, we’ll have stock for America. We’ll take back stock for the United States. At the same time, most importantly, we’ll keep those companies healthy, but we can also make incredible deals for the country so that that number will increase exponentially. I mean, this is Oh look, I’ll be the oversight. I’ll be the oversight. We’re going to make good deals. We make good deals, but these companies need it. Even if it was just a simple loan, which would be. But we can do better than that and the companies are willing to do better than that. I mean, they got hit. Most of these companies, it was through no fault of their own. There are a couple where they were troubled before they came in. We talked about one, it had troubled, nobody can believe it actually in that one.  But these companies are through no fault of their own. They have difficulty. I mean, two weeks ago, these companies were among the most solid institutions in the world. You’d want to buy their bonds, their bonds were rated AAA or whatever their highest rating is today. Now all of a sudden they have difficulty because they’ve been closed up. So you need something to keep them going, but that money is not going to be wasted money. That money’s going to be seen. We could multiply that number by many times coming back to the American public, that could be a phenomenal thing. But most importantly, it’s going to keep these great engines of jobs and ingenuity going. Very important. How about one or two more and we’ll go. Go ahead please . I don’t think so. I’m looking forward. I don’t look back. I guess there’s always something everybody regrets. There things in your life you regret. We all regret things, but I really like to look forward. I’m a person that looks… Forward thinker. I guess they would say. No, I think that we’ve handled it really well. It seems to be the American public thinks that we’ve handled it well. If you look at polling data, but I’m not interested in myself. I’m interested in the American people. We have to get this going. We have millions and millions of jobs that were solid as a rock three weeks ago and today there could be questions.  The faster we get it going, the more likely it is that those stores, little businesses, big businesses, medium sized businesses open up and we’ll get it going very fast. I really believe this is a pent up demand. I think that as soon as we say, “Let’s go.” It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be sooner than people would think. Again, we’re in a position to take care of our country, but at the same time to have the country really, really go up like a rocket ship economically. That’s great for jobs. It’s great for everything else. Yeah, please. For who? Well that’s really up to the governor. I mean I think first of all, he’s a great governor. He’s done an incredible job. Governor DeSantis of Florida and on the beaches, I guess he’s recently made a decision, but you do have a lot of room on the beaches. I think it’s just a decision that he made originally and then he’s refined it and then he’s done something that a lot of people agree with what he’s done, but he’s done a lot of things right. He’s been truly… I mean, he cares so much about health care, he cares so much about the cost of prescription drugs. He’s been a fantastic governor for Florida. They’re very happy with them.  The whole concept of the beach, it’s a very interesting issue. There are a lot of open spaces that includes parks and other things, but rather than relying on social distancing, they’re probably going to do that one in a different way. But I would imagine when we make our decision, things like that would be opened up and then people will remember what they’re supposed to be doing. Well, I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll see you tomorrow sometime and we’ll get this going, I think really well. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it ."
"Well, thank you very much, and I see we have fewer people because of the virus problem, and we appreciate you being here. This is getting to be more and more social distancing and that’s fine, that’s the way it should be, and it’s too bad. We extend our best wishes to the person affected and we feel sure that he or she will be better very soon.  Thank you for being here. America continues to mobilize every segment of our society to turn the tide in the battle against the virus. I want Americans to know that we will get through this challenge, the hardship will end, it will end soon, normal life will return and our economy will rebound very, very strongly, but right now in the midst of this great national trial, Americans must remain united in purpose and focused on victory. To every single American, please know that the sacrifice you’re making at this time is saving lives many, many lives.  It’s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They’re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They’re working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together. It’s very important. From the beginning, we have been working closely with our nation’s best scientists and medical professionals and we will continue to do so until we have defeated the virus. Our public health experts, who are terrific, are studying the variation in the disease across the country and we will be using data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time. We also have a large team working on what the next steps will be once the medical community gives a region the okay, meaning the okay to get going, to get back “Let’s go to work.”  Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down. My administration continues to work with Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement on an urgent relief bill for the millions of American workers, and small businesses and large businesses that were badly affected by the medical difficulty that we’ve had. If you had a viable business in January, we are committed to ensuring the same is true in the coming weeks. In fact, we want to make it even better than it was before and we’re doing things to help in that regard. America will again, and soon be open for business. Very soon. A lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner.  We can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. At the end of the 15 day period we’ll make a decision as to which way we want to go, where we want to go, the timing, and essentially we’re referring to the timing of the opening, essentially the opening of our country, because we have it pretty well shut down in order to get rid of this invisible enemy.  Two weeks ago we moved at record speed to pass paid sick leave and paid family medical leave, and approved $8 billion including money for the development of treatments and vaccines, and we’re doing tremendous work in both, on both fronts. The vaccines are coming along very quickly. Now, Congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the Senate bill as written and avoid playing anymore partisan games. They have to get together and just stop with the partisan politics, and I think that’s happening. I got a call a little while ago, I guess they’re getting closer. It should go quickly, and it must go quickly. It’s not really choice. They don’t have a choice, they have to make a deal. This should not be a time for political agendas, but rather one for focusing solely and squarely on the needs of the American people. We are going to save American workers and we’re going to save them quickly, and we’re going to save our great American companies, both small and large. This was a medical problem, we are not going to let it turn into a long lasting financial problem.  It started out as a purely medical problem and it’s not going to go beyond that. We’re just not going to allow that to happen. Our country was at its strongest financial point, we’ve never had an economy like we had just a few weeks ago, and then it got a hit with something that nobody could have ever thought possible, and we are fixing it. We’re fixing it quickly, and I want to just thank the American people for what they’ve been through and what they’re doing. Our country will be stronger than ever before and we fully anticipate that, and it won’t be that long.  Let me provide you with an update on critical supplies. FEMA is distributing 8,000,095 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now, focusing on the areas with the greatest need. We have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the state of Washington. In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks. We’re having millions and millions of masks made as we speak, and other personal protective equipment which we will be distributing to medical hotspots. We’re focused on some of the hotspots across the nation. We’re seeing an outpouring of creativity and innovative ideas widely shared between the federal health leaders, governors and mayors, the scientific community and members of the private sector really working together. Everybody’s working together.  I’m pleased to report that clinical trials in New York will begin existing for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus. At my direction, the federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of flororoquin, and you can look from any standpoint tomorrow in New York, we think tomorrow pretty early. The hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination probably is looking very, very good and it’s going to be distributed. We have 10,000 units going, and it’ll be distributed tomorrow. It’ll be available, and it is now. They already have it. They’re going to distribute it tomorrow morning to a lot of people in New York City and New York. We’re studying it very closely, watching it very closely. You probably saw a couple of articles today came out where a gentleman, they thought he was not going to make it, he said goodbye to his family, they had given him the drug just a little while before, but he thought it was over. His family thought he was going to die, and a number of hours later he woke up, felt good. Then he woke up again and he felt really good, and he’s in good shape, and he’s very happy for this particular drug that we got approved in record setting time.  There’s never been anything even close to it, and I want to thank the FDA, which has been incredible, and Dr. Hahn, Stephen Hahn, a highly respected man, but they’re doing everything possible to increase production and available supply of these drugs, not only this drug but also others that are coming. Remdesivir is coming from Regeneron, a couple of others are also under study, but the one that I’m very excited about right now is the one we just mentioned, and I think there’s a real chance, I mean, again, we don’t know, but there’s a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact. It would be a gift from God if that worked. It would be a big game changer, so we’ll see, but distribution starts tomorrow morning early in New York and I think a lot of people are going to be, hopefully they’re going to be very happy with the result, but we’re all going to be watching closely. It’s something we have to try. It’s been very, very successful on Malaria, very, very successful, and countries with Malaria have had an interesting thing happen. They take this particular drug, it’s a very powerful drug, and there is very little semblance of the virus in those countries, and there are those that say because this drug is very prevalent because of the Malaria, so we’ll see what happens.  I’m also announcing that we’re postponing the deadline for compliance with real ID requirements at a time when we’re asking Americans to maintain social distancing. We do want to require people to go with their local DMV. We will be announcing the new deadline very soon. It’s going to be announced in a very short moment.  Over night, we successfully brought home 103 American citizens after they had been stranded for 10 days in Brazil following a cruise. We want to thank the Brazilian government and their great president. Most of those returned were senior citizens. My administration, in cooperation with Governor Greg Abbott of Texas and the private sector coordinated their safe return to the United States, so thank you to Governor Abbott, a terrific governor, terrific man.  Earlier today I signed an executive order invoking presidential authority under Section 45-12 of the Defense Production act to prohibit the hoarding of vital medical equipment and supplies such as hand sanitizers, face masks and personal protective equipment. We have a lot of face masks, a lot of equipment just coming in, and we have some people hoarding, and Attorney General Barr’s going to be speaking about that in a second. We want to prevent price gouging and critical health and medical resources are going to be protected in every form. Under this directive the Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to designate essential health and medical supplies as scarce, so he’ll designate certain supplies and medical elements as scarce, and that means it will be a crime to stockpile these items in excessive quantities, which is happening to a relatively small degree we think, but nevertheless, it’s happening. We can’t let it happen, and we can’t let them resell them at excessive prices, which some people are doing. Very simply, will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit, so we’re going to be watching that with our great Attorney General very closely.  The Department of Justice will be aggressively prosecuting fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic. Yesterday, federal prosecutors took action in their first case, shutting down a website selling a totally fake vaccine, if you can believe that one. As president, I will always fight to protect Americans from being exploited. Thankfully, all throughout the country we’re witnessing extraordinary acts of compassion, benevolence and unity. Construction companies are donating masks by the hundreds of thousands, manufacturing workers are transforming their assembly lines, citizens are volunteering to deliver food and medicine to the elderly, we’re truly seeing America at its best. We’re really seeing things that people never thought even could happen. Frankly, we never thought this could happen, but the way most Americans are working toward getting it solved and just doing what they have to do to make this go away has been incredible. It’s been incredible.  I want to take a moment to thank the everyday heroes who are making our vast effort against the virus possible, and thank you to the healthcare workers and the first responders. These are very brave people. Thanks also to the hardworking men and women of Federal Express, UPS, the United States Postal Service, and the truckers who are maintaining our supply chains and supply lines. We thank you very much. Great job. We also want to give our regards and thanks to everyone at our grocery stores working the night shift so that shelves can be restocked, and the restaurant workers and delivery drivers keeping our families fed. So many of these restaurants, it’s incredible. They’re doing a service where people come and they pick it up, delivery. It’s been incredible what they’ve been doing. A totally different business than they were in, other than they cook food. Other than that, it’s like a totally different business.  Most of all, I want to thank the American people for rising to the challenge and showing incredible courage, determination, patience, grace and grit. From New York to Seattle and everywhere in between, your acts of selflessness, and sacrifice and ingenuity are a powerful testament to the American character. It’s really being shown. It’s really showing up at a level that people are really respecting. All over the world, they’re respecting, and the world has problems. We’re 148 countries now. 148 countries are affected by the invisible scourge, and all of the uplifting reflections of the American spirit are out there for everyone to see. Together, we will care for our fellow citizens and we will win this war, and we’ll win it much sooner than people think and we’ll be back in business as a country pretty soon. You’ll be hearing about that also pretty soon.  Now, I’d like to ask Attorney General Bill Barr to say a few words, and we’ll take questions in a little while. Thank you. Thank you very much, .  Deborah? Deborah, please. Thank you very much, Deborah. . Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Of course I do. It’s going to be bad and we have a lot of people dying from the flu. As you know, we have a very bad flu season on top of everything else. It’s very bad. It looks like it could be over 50,000, and certainly this is going to be bad. We’re trying to make it so that it’s much, much less bad and that’s what we’re doing. I think we’re doing a very good job of it.  If you look at other countries, what they’ve been through, and you look at the kind of numbers and compare them to ours, which is a much larger country than most, the numbers are pretty amazing. And it started with the fact that we stopped people from coming in from a highly infected area and that was a good thing to do. So yeah, it’s bad and obviously the numbers are going to increase with time, and then they’re going to start to decrease.  And we’re going to be opening our country up for business because our country was meant to be open and working with others but especially for our workers. And the engine for that whole system is we have to have companies and these companies are loved by our workers because they’re paying big salaries and big dollars to our workers. And we’re going to get it all going again very soon, hopefully very, very soon.  Please. Well, you’ll see what happens. I understand the question very well. It’s a great question, but we can do two things at one time. I will say this, our country’s learned a lot. We’ve learned about social distancing. We’ve learned about the hands, we’ve learned about staying away at least during the time that this is even a little bit around this disease or whatever you want to call it. Many different names, you can go up many different names, but the virus while it’s around.  And we can start thinking about, as an example, parts of our country are very lightly effected, very small numbers. You look at a state, great governor, Pete Ricketts in Nebraska. You look at the kind of numbers they have out there. They have one of the great hospitals there too, relative to what we’re talking about. But you look at Nebraska, you look at Idaho, you look at Iowa. I could name many countries that are handling it very, very well and that are not affected to the same extent or frankly not even nearly to the extent of New York. I’m dealing with the Governor Cuomo and we’re dealing very well together. We’ll be sending that ship up, by the way, as you know. We have a ship going to Los Angeles. The ship is coming out of a very large repair, so ready to go or very soon will be. And over the next three or four weeks that’ll be coming up to New York. We’ll go to New York Harbor and it’ll be fully supplied, so they’re working on that right now. Well, I didn’t say a week, but I said soon. It’s going to be a soon. It’s not going to be three or four months as some people were saying and a lot of people thought originally, but I would certainly let you answer. I think that’s a great definition, and I will say we’re going to be watching our senior citizens very closely. We’re going to be watching certain hotspots like New York, and within New York you have areas which are troubling and we’ll be working with the governor and the mayor and everybody else on those spots.  But at the same time, at a certain point, we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers. We want to take care of our workers, so we’ll be doing something I think relatively quickly, but we’ve learned a lot during this period. This was a very necessary period. Tremendous information was gained, but we can do two things at one time.  And again, I say, we have a very active flu season, more active than most. It’s looking like it’s heading to 50,000 or more deaths, deaths not cases. 50,000 deaths, that’s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we’re talking about. That doesn’t mean we’re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. We have to do things to get our country open. But this has been an incredible period of learning and we’ll have announcements over the next fairly short period as to the timing. John, please. Yeah. I’ll let you answer him. Uh-oh. Whew. Thank you for saying that. Thank you very much. Well, they will be in place. At some point, we’re going to open up our country and it’s going to be fairly soon. I’m not looking at months, I can tell you right now. We’re going to be opening up our country and we’re going to be watching certain areas and we’re going to be practicing everything that Deborah is referring to right here. I mean, we’re going to be watching this very closely, but you can’t keep it closed for years, okay.  This is going away. We’re going to win the battle, but you have tremendous responsibility. We have jobs. We have people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this. When you have terrible economies, you have death probably, and I mean definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus. We have an obligation. We have a double obligation.  We have a great country. There is no country like it in the world and there’s no economy like it in the world. I mean, we were just blazing. We were coming out with numbers that some numbers weren’t even reported because this had happened. They were meaningless. I got numbers about myself that were meaningless. Because by the time the numbers came in, it’s a whole different world with this.  But I will tell you that we can do both things, John. We can do them both at the same time. I mean, that’s okay. What we have gone through is a tremendous learning process and we’ve also solved a lot of problems. But we’ve gone through a tremendous learning situation. Now, we’re building hospitals in New York. We’re building hospitals in California. We’re building hospitals in the state of Washington. We’ve been in touch with the governors. Today I spoke with a man that I happened to like. I spoke with Phil in New Jersey and where we’re going to be doing something very meaningful in New Jersey. We’re doing something… I spoke with, JB Pritzker called me today. We’re going to be helping them out in Illinois. We’re doing a lot of things in Florida.  We’re doing a lot of things between FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Admiral in your group in terms of the purchasing, that’s what he does. He purchases. He supposed to be great. I’ll tell you in about two days, but he’s going to do a fantastic job. We have an incredibly talented group of people. But yeah, we’ll be doing two things and three things at one time.  Well, at the same time though, we’re going to be watching very closely the hotspots. We’re going to be taking care and watching very closely our senior citizens, especially those with a problem or an illness. We’re going to be watching them very, very closely; and we can do that and have an open economy, have an open country. And we have to do that because that causes other problems and maybe it causes much bigger problems than the problem we’re talking about now. You understand. Jeff, please. I think the cure has been very tough. This has been very tough. This was an operation. This was somebody going to a doctor and saying, “You need an operation,” and we’ve had an operation. We’ve learned a lot and we fixed a lot of problems. One of the things we fixed is if you look at the absolute system that this administration inherited, it wasn’t meant for this. It was meant for a small group of people; and even for that, it was not very good and very obsolete.  We have a testing program now that will hopefully be able to be used for many years into the future should we have another event like this. I don’t think you’ll have another event like this. This is very unique. You look back into time, you look back decades and decades. We can name them all. Even if you go back 10 years, you know you go back to ’09, but that wasn’t like this as it turned out. But they lost a lot of people. We were early. We were early,, Jeff because of the fact that we closed early. That was a big move. Please, . Yeah, go ahead, Jim. Well, it’s not change. No, we’re doing things… Yeah. This was a learning experience for the people of the country. If what’s changed? Well, I think we’ve learned a lot. I think that there’s so much discipline now that we never had. Nobody ever said don’t shake hands. I did actually before I became a politician. Once I became a politician then it’s hard getting used to not doing it because you do it with everybody. With literally thousands of people a week, you’re shaking hands with big groups of people.  We’ve learned a lot. There’s a great discipline that this whole country has learned having to do with distancing, having to do with shaking hands. I think a lot of it’s going to stay long after the viruses go and I really think it’s probably good practice anyway, but I think it’s going to stay long after the virus has gone.  We have to open our country because that causes problems that, in my opinion, could be far bigger problems, far bigger. Look, this is a severe medical situation that could cause problems far beyond the medical, and then increase the medical problems to things that had nothing to do with this original medical problem. We can’t let that happen to our country. We have the greatest country in the world. I’m not going to let that happen, but this two weeks that we have spent, has been an incredible learning period and process. Please, Kristin. I spoke to them today and I was telling them that we have two things to look forward. Don’t forget the doctors, if it were up to the doctors, they may say let’s keep it shut down. Let’s shut down the entire world. Because, again, you’re up to almost 150 countries, so let’s shut down the entire world. And when we shut it down, that would be wonderful and let’s keep it shut for a couple of years. You know you can’t do that and you can’t do that with a country, especially the number one economy anywhere in the world by far. Number one economy in the world, you can’t do that. Well, it causes bigger problems than the original. That’s why I talk about the cure being worse than the problem. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem. But what we have done… So this is not retracing, this isn’t anything. We’ve done it really well because this two-week period has been good and I’m not saying it ends at that time. We have another seven days or so. I’m not saying it ends at that time, but I am saying it’s been this incredible learning process. That’s going to go into the future. That’s going to go even as we open up our country. And we’re going to be watching New York and we’re going to be watching California, we’re going to be watching the state of Washington and other places. Illinois is becoming a hotspot, and we can do both.  Now, we may quarantine… I mean we will be quarantining many people in these areas. There are other areas that just aren’t affected or they’re affected very little. And why would we close down 100% of the country? There are areas within New York where New York will be open, but there are areas within New York. Remember this, New York has the New York Stock Exchange. It has NASDAQ, it has the exchanges. To close the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ with all of the great work they’re doing. I mean, they’ve gone largely to computer. You look at the floor, it’s incredible what they can do, but it’s fully open. But we don’t want to be doing that.  What I’m saying basically is that we can do two things simultaneously, and we’ve had this incredible learning period. Plus, people have been in a period and they won’t be calling, “Oh gee.” Because I’ve got many, many people that now come to me and say, “We get it. We think we can really do it now and do it while we’re open.” So at some point, we’ll be setting some guidelines, we’ll be setting some datelines and we’ll be announcing them in the not too distant future. Well, not endorsed. We talked together, and I think they’re okay with it and I’m okay with it, but this could be a much bigger problem. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you start off with. Now other nations are going to have to do what they’re going to do, but they’ll probably do something very similar.  But in our case, much more so than anyone else, because of the magnitude of our economy, the tremendous size of what we’ve built and what we have and the jobs involved. You have almost 160 million jobs in this country now, the most ever by far, by far the most ever. The number of jobs, almost 160 million, so we can’t turn that off and think it’s going to be wonderful. They’ll be tremendous repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that, death. You’re talking about death.  Death from the death, you’re talking about death. Probably more death from that than anything that we’re talking about with respect to the virus. No, I think we’re going to do them both. I think that’s what I’m saying. I think we can do them both now. Now, we haven’t announced a date, but we’re getting fairly close to coming up with a date and it’s a much shorter period of time than I’ve been hearing the news report. And I think everybody should be happy with that, but great knowledge was gained. Please. You mean with the Democrats you’re talking about? Well, it is true. If he said… I didn’t hear him say that, but if he said, “Difficult trade-offs,” sure. It’s less convenient. Before you walk and you’d hop in the subway and you had grab the handle and you go down to wherever you’re going on Wall Street and you do all sorts of things and you go in and you open the doors going into your great buildings or into the exchanges and now you’re not going to have to… Maybe you think about doing that or you’re going to think about doing it a different way.  No, no. There are many trade-offs. It’s a different life and maybe it will remain that way frankly after the invisible scourge is gone. Maybe it’s going to say that way. Not a bad thing to stay that way, but no, there are trade-offs. There’s no question about that, but I actually think it’s going to… I think in the end we’re going to end up being bigger, better and stronger. We have learned a lot. Please. That’s true. Latin America. No, we’re not really. Something like that could happen, I guess, but we’re not really. They thought we were going to have bans within the United States. We didn’t do that. We’re not going to have that. Hopefully that’ll take care of itself. No ones, in Latin America, there is a, there’s been an uptick. Yeah, please. Yeah, because it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all. These are incredible people. They love our country and I’m not going to let it happen. I just wanted to make that point. Because they’re blaming China- People are blaming China. And they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage and I’m not going to let that happen. Please. Yeah, the governors of the various states will have a lot of leeway. If we open up, and when we open up, the governors in certain states. For instance, you go to some of the states I just mentioned, those schools are going to be open. Many cases, they’re open now, but the schools are going to be open. In other cases, Governor Cuomo, Gavin Newsom, of California, certain governors are going to maybe have a decision to make. Now, they may make a decision to keep them open in a certain part of New York and maybe in Westchester County or wherever it may be, they’ll keep them closed.  But they’re going to have leeway. We giving the governors a lot of leeway. The governors are going to make those decisions. That’s going to be up to the governors and they’re very capable. They’ll be able to make the decisions. Please. Because the virus has had a big impact on our country, so we’re going to give a stimulus so that the workers can live their life. It was not their fault, it wasn’t the workers’ fault. And we are going to give a kick, so that it’s a kick. And this way we think the workers can get a fair start. The small businesses, we’re taking very good care of, we want to take care of these small businesses. They really are the engine of this country. A lot of people don’t know that. Everyone thinks of these great, big, beautiful businesses, who by the way have been very badly hurt also.  But the small businesses have really, historically been the engine and they still are the engine of the country. And you’d be amazed. The workers love those businesses and the workers contact us and they want us to help those businesses because that’s where they’ve made their living.  That’s where they’ve been paid a lot of money over the years. And you’ve been seeing what’s happened over the last three years, where salaries and wages have gone up very substantially for those workers. And then, we got caught by this sudden craziness coming into our country and coming all over the world. We need to make sure that the companies are strong and that the workers are strong and that’s what we’re doing. And hopefully, the Republicans and Democrats are going to be able to make a deal and they’re actually fairly close. But we’ll see what happens. Please. Well, one of the things you’re going to have to save companies that have been shattered. You’re going to have to save a various, I mean, you know a lot of the companies yourselves, we have a company that was I think the greatest company in the world named Boeing. Boeing is going to need some help. Now, Boeing had some difficulty before. That’s unlike others. We have other companies that didn’t have a problem coming in. Boeing had the obvious problem that everybody knows about from a little more than a year ago, a double problem, and it was a big one.  And then on top of it, as they’re getting ready to really show their stuff on top of it, we all get hit by this and obviously the airlines are going to have a problem, but the airlines aren’t going to be buying from Boeing or from anybody else right now because of this difficulty. We have to work with the airlines, we have to work with the cruise lines. We have to work with the companies like a Boeing because Boeing’s a potentially, again, a great company. Had a very rough period of 13 months, a very rough period, a horrible period. An unbelievable period.  If you would’ve told me this would have happened to Boeing, I wouldn’t have believed it. Because to me it was truly one of the great, one of the truly great, probably almost one point of GDP if you can think of that’s hard to believe, that a company could have that kind of an impact. But Boeing, we have to work with it for two reasons.  Number one, it’s a great company that we have to save. Number two, it produces unbelievable numbers of jobs. And so, the numbers have to be reflective of that kind of a thing. Please. You know what I’m going to do? We have wonderful people behind us that are working very hard and we want Bill to get back to the Department of Justice, so we want the admiral to start going and doing your job. And the same thing with Deb. If anybody would have any questions, maybe I’ll ask Mike to stay around, but if anybody would have any questions for the group and otherwise I’ll let them get back to work. Please. Go ahead, please. We have some, it should be fairly quick. I have a question for you. We have a lot of very angry media all around this room and they want one of these seats, but because of social distancing, we are keeping them empty and they are keeping them empty. Will there ever be a time when all of those really angry, angry people who don’t like me much to start off with, but now they really don’t like me, will there ever be a time when these seats are full, like full to the brim like it used to be where people are almost sitting on each other’s lap?  And this whole row over here is packed and now they’re outside wanting to get in and they’re very jealous of all of these reporters. Will we ever have that again? Or is that something that will be, you know, it’ll look like this forever? Right? But when the virus is gone, will the people be allowed to sit next to each other again, in your opinion in a tight room with a tight? Yup, you’re doing it. And I think the big factor is the mortality rate, we’re talking about about the mortality rate. When we first started, people were thinking about three and 4% and now we’re talking about a much lower number than that. I think it’s a- I think it’s a number that will be a lot different than people thought. . It’s much lower than we originally thought. I mean, frankly- It’s a lot lower. Doctor, it’s just very interesting. The whole thing. It’s an incredible subject. When somebody is very sick, they go to a doctor, go to a hospital, they’re recorded, they’re very sick, and then they live or they don’t live, see what happens. But when somebody isn’t very sick at all, I’ve heard people that they don’t even know they had it and they’re healing. Then I’ve heard people that have like a cold or they have a running nose or even people that stay home and they think they have the flu, or in some cases they think they have a really bad case of the flu.  But all of those people, that vast majority of, I mean beyond vast majority of people, they’re not reporting. They’re not calling the doctor, they’re not calling them. They’re just getting better. You would think it would have to be because the people that are sick are going to a doctor or they’re going someplace, and they’re going to say, “Make me better.” The people that are just short of that and people that aren’t even, I mean, we have many people where they literally don’t even know that they have it. Now, you’re building up the number of cases that we talked about before and yet, so you don’t know any what, you don’t know how many they are. . It could be a vast number. But what you do know is all the people that are really sick.  Because all of the people that are really sick are going to a doctor in some form. And the doctor is reporting it in all cases itself. I’m talking about many forms. We’re talking about… Look, number one, it’s the country itself. You’re talking tremendous disruption economically, but you’re talking about massive depression, massive numbers of suicide- No, I’m talking about, no, I’m not talking about economic. Although, you could be talking about that, too. What I’m talking about is people suffering massive depression because they had a fantastic job and now they have no idea what’s going on. Now, here’s the good news. If they get the bill passed, we’re taking care of those people. We’re going to really take good care of those people beyond what any country has done for people. But there’s never been anything like this.  No. I’m talking about where people suffer massive depression,, where people commit suicide, where tremendous death happens. Now in addition to that, we’re talking about economic where you really hurt a country. It could take years and years to recover. And the longer you stay out, the harder it is to recover. I happen to think that you’re going to have, they call it the V, I think you’re going to have a very big bounce, you know, a very big bounce back. I think it’s going to be very big. We’ll see. Well, I think the bill should pass. It’s should pass quickly. Take care of our workers, take care of the companies that pay those workers, help those companies over this rough patch. But the longer it takes, the harder it is to come back. I’d like to be able to bounce back to where we were. And ultimately I think we’re going to be even further than that. But I’m just saying that the… What’s happening when I say the cure and the cure could be worse than the problem itself. Right? That’s what I, we can’t let that happen. We can’t let that happen.  We’ve learned so much and so many good things are going to happen for our country. We can’t let this continue to go on. What we’re doing is we’re meeting with the doctors, Dr.Fauci, Dr. Birx and others and we’re, we’ve already started the discussion. And I can say that I’m a student like you’re students. We’re all learning this together. I learned a lot from Deborah. I learned a lot from Tony.  I learned a lot from a lot of people that this is, this has been their life’s work. I’ve learned a lot. We’re going to come up with a date and we’re going to do two things. We can do two things at one time. At the same time, we’re going to be very vigilant. We’re going to be so vigilant in terms of all of the things that we have to do that we’ve been talking about for the last two weeks ad nauseum. And I think it’s going to be ultimately a far better solution for our country. Yeah, please go ahead.  want her to go back and you want her to go back to work. Immediately. Thank you. Great job. Thank you, Deborah. Yeah, Deborah? They won’t let you go. Thank you. Go ahead, one second, please. Well, it is. It’s something we’re talking to a lot of people about. We’ll see what happens, but we’re talking to people about it. Go ahead, please. Let me just, I was just with him for a long time. And- Oh, he’s at the task force meeting right now. We have a task force meeting. He was there. Well, he doesn’t not agree. I mean, we had a long talk and he understands this tremendous, there’s a tremendous cost to our country, both in terms of lives and in terms of economics and in terms of many, many years of rebuilding something that was a fine tuned machine. It was nobody’s fault. It just happened. This horrible virus came from wherever and it just happened. It just happened. He fully understands that now. He’s a good man. I like Dr. Fauci a lot, just so you understand.  No, he’s not here because we really weren’t discussing what he’s best at, but he’ll be back up very soon. Yeah, please. And we’ll be discussing dates and times with him. And we are talking about a… I don’t want to use the word abbreviated because so much has been gained by what we’ve done. But we’re talking about not during the period, you know, during the 14 or 15 days, but not too long after that- Which, I think is going to make a lot of people happy. It’s going to make a lot of companies happy. It’s going to make a lot of workers happy. Yeah, John? I would certainly, he’s very important to me and I would, I will be listening to him. I’ll be listening to Deborah, who you just spoke to. I’ll be listening to other experts. We have a lot of people that are very good at this, and ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but-  Ultimately, it’s a balancing act, but the expression, we can do two things at one time and we’ve got an incredible country. We have to keep it that way and that includes not just economics, that also includes life and death. We have to keep it that way. Well, I’ve gotten to like this room. This room is very convenient. I can say from the standpoint of being president of the United States I really… This has been a very convenient room for all of us. You people are set up, so I never even thought of closing it. So you’re asking me a question that I never thought in terms of closing it. Can you give me a good reason to close it? We could build a larger one. I don’t want to make commitments like that because it’s not something I’ve ever really thought about. There are certain people that would like to see a larger room built. We need a larger room. Other presidents didn’t need such a large room, but we need a larger room and there are some people, but it’s not something that is really on my mind to be honest with you. Yes, please. Which period? I think we’re listening to many people. I mean that was my world. I know many of those people. I have many people that are friends of mine, some enemies also by the way. But it’s been a good world for me. I like that world. I like those people. They’re tough and they’re smart. But I listened to many of them. Ultimately, they all go into that computer and I say, this is what we’re going to do. I have to make a decision. This is a very important man right here to my right, our great vice president, because he’s got a great instinct about things too. So I’m going to be listening to my case, headed up the task force I think brilliantly. I think it’s going to go down as that because he’s really done a job. Not only has he been good, he’s been soothing. He’s really been great for the American public to watch it.  I mean that in the most positive way. There’s a solidity with Mike that you don’t find in many people. He’s been soothing. He’s been good for the American public. They have confidence in him. I think he’s done an incredible job and his advice is very, very important to me. So he’s going to be making… I mean, he didn’t come from that world, the world of finance, but he understands the world of finance. He was a great governor in Indiana. They did very well financially too. I can give you a whole list and we’ll probably even set up committees. I’d rather give you one because then I’m going to leave out… I have spoken to so many people and- What? I am happy with him. Yes. I think he’s… I really think he’s a caught up and he’s done the right thing and I think ultimately we will be rewarded because of the decision he made over the last… He’s really stepped up over the last week and I have to tell you, I called him today and I said, Jerome, good job. You really did it . It might be, he was just a little bit slower than I would have liked in the sense of what he was doing. Now, other people might have liked it, but today I called up Jerome Powell and I said, “Jerome, you’ve done a really good job.” I was proud of him. That took courage and ultimately you’re going to see the fruits. Now. He’s not finished. I mean, he’s got other arrows in the quiver or whatever they say, I will tell you he’s got plenty of arrows. But no, I’m very happy with the job he did. No wait, I just want to say, we’re thinking about it. China has very much stepped up as you probably know, the agricultural purchases from our farmers and some other purchases too. So they have a difficult time also right now. But they’ve very much stepped up their purchases and significantly. So we’re very happy about that. The other thing, I’m standing here, this case with our vice president trying to let you ask anything you want having to do with the subject, which frankly is pretty much all anyone cares about right now. Because I think it’s very important. I don’t want to stand here for two hours and do this, but I think it’s important that I call it get it out of your system. Give us any question about it because I think it’s important for the public to know. So we don’t want to answer two questions and leave. We want to answer your questions.  That’s why we’re doing this for so long. I think it gives our country confidence and it gives… I think we’re all gaining knowledge. This has been an unbelievable process, but we’re all getting… So I want to stay here. Sometimes we’re here for two hours and we’re answering questions. At least you will say that I’m very transparent. I think you’re going to have a hard time saying he is not transparent. But we take a lot of questions from you. Unfortunately, some of them are repetitive and some of them are fantastic questions. Some of these questions are great. Some of the questions lead to us solving a problem. You bring up problems that people didn’t know existed. But I just want to let you know so we’re doing this so that we can be transparent so that we can get everything out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah. We’re very, very close to them. We had a couple of great talks plus I’ve spoken to a number of them individually. Yeah, we’re very, very closely aligned. Please. That’s going to make a big difference because that really is a process that’s easy as opposed to the current process, which is not, as I’ve said, it’s not pleasant. Yeah. Then ultimately I have to make a decision, but I certainly listened to them. I listened to a number of people. I have a lot of respect for Dr. Fauci and for Dr. Birx and I’ll be listening to them and others that we have that are really doing good. John. We have now a system and the systems in place and we have two very, very powerful alternatives that we have to take into consideration. And as I said, one of the things that has really gotten me thinking about this, number one, I’m looking at what’s going on and you know it’s life is fragile and economies are fragile, but one of the things is the mortality rate, John. When we first started this, nobody knew anything about this particular virus. Very, very little. I mean we started, if we were hearing numbers of 5% that would, that’s an astronomical number when the flu is 0.001 and two and three, right? So 5% would be an astronomical number. Now we’re seeing numbers that may be less than one and that’s not including the exercise that I just went through where many people don’t report. So everybody getting very sick is reporting, but nobody getting not very sick.  That should be part of that equation. So that just keeps reducing the number. So the mortality rate, that’s a big… To me that’s a very big factor. When we were hearing three and 4%, remember we had one day where we thought it was 5% and we’re getting a lot of bad numbers from countries that, I don’t know why, but we were getting a lot of bad numbers. I do wish, again, our relationship’s very good with China, but I wished they could have told us about this a little bit sooner. You know that. But the mortality rate is a big thing for me because I think we’re very substantially under 1% now. It’s still terrible. It’s still the whole thing. The whole concept of death is terrible, but there’s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and four or five or even 3%. So that’s something that we’re learning now. I think the number may be lower than people think because of what I’ve been saying. Yeah, please. Well, I thought we had a deal last night and then the Democrats changed the deal. So we had a deal last night that was going to be phenomenal for the workers, which is my number one aim. I want to take care of the workers and we had a deal. I was pretty sure we had a deal last night if you would told me at a certain time about 9:00 I would have told you we pretty much have a deal. And then all of a sudden it changed. It changed fairly rapidly. It was unaccepted. It would have been bad for our country and they were asking for things that would have not been good. I mean things that that bore no relationship to what we’re talking about and we said that’s not the game. We can’t play that game. So we’ll see. Look, the Democrats do want to make a deal. But Jeff, I thought we had a deal last night. I’ll work with anybody to help the American people. I will. I don’t care who it is. I’ll work with anybody. If I feel I’m going to help the American people and the American worker. Yeah, please. Well, you just saw the Admiral and you just saw the FEMA people and you just saw the army corps of engineers. We’re building hospitals in New York and California and State of Washington and New Jersey. I just made a commitment to fill that we’re going to help him out with some of the areas in New Jersey, which is very important, a great state. So, we’re doing a great job and with it to help the governors, but the governors are on the front line and they can do some of it themselves. Governor Cuomo, he’s been working very hard and he worked with me on the hospitals and medical centers because it’s not just hospitals, it’s called hospital and another is medical centers of which we’re building numerous for New York. We have it all laid out. We have Javits center and then we have other locations throughout the state.  I think it’s really a great plan and we’re going to have FEMA and the army corps of engineers involved. I’ve worked with them we’re building a wall. We’re up to over 150 miles of wall on our Southern border, which is now turning out to be even more important than we originally thought. But I always thought it was very important having borders. So, I’m working with the army corps of engineers and I see what they do and how they do it. That’s used to be my business. I know it very well and they’re very professional. They’re really good.  So you’re going to see a lot of good things happening in many States beyond the States. I just mentioned in many States, we’re working with governor Ron DeSantis in Florida. We’re working with governor McMaster, right? In South Carolina where they have a little bit of a breakout, not by comparison but a little bit. We’re working with many, many governors and many, many states. Actually States where you almost would think that they have it under pretty good control and they’ve done a great job, but we’re working with many states and that’s primarily FEMA and the army corps of engineer. They’re capable of doing it. Well, a lot of the provisions that they wanted, like stock buy backs. I agree with it. That’s good with me. I mean, I don’t like them buying back stock. I like them spending money on airplanes and on their employees and they real business, not buying back stock. I don’t know if that provision is going to be put in one way or the other. But I’m all for it and many Republicans, I can tell you are for it and I think many Democrats are for it. But they were putting that out like it was a problem last night. Not a problem for me, I can tell you that, please. Well, I think when you’re talking about right now is at least $3,000 per family of four in that correct. $3,000 for a family of four, which is bold. If this continued, we have to build this up and if this continued we’ll do something else and we’ll do more at a later date. But that’s a big number. If you remember, they were talking about $500 and $600 and we are all for the three. As of this moment, it’s $3,000 for a family of four. Please go ahead. Well, we have a very strong dollar and a strong dollar is good in many ways, but it’s also tough in many ways because it makes trade much harder. It makes it much harder for a Caterpillar tractor and other companies to sell their goods to Europe or China or wherever they may be sold. So having a strong dollar is good, but it really sounds good. But the truth is it makes certain things like trade much tougher. Our dollar, I don’t know if you’ve seen, but our dollars have been very strong, especially against other currencies, very, very strong. Which again, makes that trading more difficult. But there’s something nice about having a strong dollar, right? No matter what, I’m president, I used to have a strong dollar, but it does make trading more different. Well, I think the Democrats want a deal and I think we want to deal. So it would be very foolish if they didn’t make a deal. The American public is demanding it. I can tell you the Republicans want to make a deal and we want to make a deal that’s good for the workers, good for the country. I really believe the Democrats want to make a deal, but they have to stop asking for things that bear no relationship to what we’re talking about. That are actually bad. That are actually not good for the country. Well, let’s see what happens. I have to see what happens. Right now we don’t have a deal, but I think we’re very close. I mean, when I left, which was quite a while ago now, because again, we’re trying to answer every question so there’s no… Be nice if you were just exhausted and said, “That’s it. We can’t do any more.” But there’s always hands up. Maybe one of those questions is great and unique, but now look I want what’s good for the country and if that means meeting, I think that’s great. I just want what’s good for the country, great for our workers, great for the citizens of the United States. That’s all it - It’s been a little. Yeah, please. Yes. She’s great. She’s fine. Negative. Well, we need that to help all of these companies that have a chance of not being companies anymore, and that’s going to be a good thing for the country because deals will be made and we’re talking to certain people. Some of the greatest people in the history of Wall Street, frankly. Where when they do a deal, we’ll have stock for America. We’ll take back stock for the United States. At the same time, most importantly, we’ll keep those companies healthy, but we can also make incredible deals for the country so that that number will increase exponentially. I mean, this is Oh look, I’ll be the oversight. I’ll be the oversight. We’re going to make good deals. We make good deals, but these companies need it. Even if it was just a simple loan, which would be. But we can do better than that and the companies are willing to do better than that. I mean, they got hit. Most of these companies, it was through no fault of their own. There are a couple where they were troubled before they came in. We talked about one, it had troubled, nobody can believe it actually in that one.  But these companies are through no fault of their own. They have difficulty. I mean, two weeks ago, these companies were among the most solid institutions in the world. You’d want to buy their bonds, their bonds were rated AAA or whatever their highest rating is today. Now all of a sudden they have difficulty because they’ve been closed up. So you need something to keep them going, but that money is not going to be wasted money. That money’s going to be seen. We could multiply that number by many times coming back to the American public, that could be a phenomenal thing. But most importantly, it’s going to keep these great engines of jobs and ingenuity going. Very important. How about one or two more and we’ll go. Go ahead please . I don’t think so. I’m looking forward. I don’t look back. I guess there’s always something everybody regrets. There things in your life you regret. We all regret things, but I really like to look forward. I’m a person that looks… Forward thinker. I guess they would say. No, I think that we’ve handled it really well. It seems to be the American public thinks that we’ve handled it well. If you look at polling data, but I’m not interested in myself. I’m interested in the American people. We have to get this going. We have millions and millions of jobs that were solid as a rock three weeks ago and today there could be questions.  The faster we get it going, the more likely it is that those stores, little businesses, big businesses, medium sized businesses open up and we’ll get it going very fast. I really believe this is a pent up demand. I think that as soon as we say, “Let’s go.” It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be pretty soon. It’s going to be sooner than people would think. Again, we’re in a position to take care of our country, but at the same time to have the country really, really go up like a rocket ship economically. That’s great for jobs. It’s great for everything else. Yeah, please. For who? Well that’s really up to the governor. I mean I think first of all, he’s a great governor. He’s done an incredible job. Governor DeSantis of Florida and on the beaches, I guess he’s recently made a decision, but you do have a lot of room on the beaches. I think it’s just a decision that he made originally and then he’s refined it and then he’s done something that a lot of people agree with what he’s done, but he’s done a lot of things right. He’s been truly… I mean, he cares so much about health care, he cares so much about the cost of prescription drugs. He’s been a fantastic governor for Florida. They’re very happy with them.  The whole concept of the beach, it’s a very interesting issue. There are a lot of open spaces that includes parks and other things, but rather than relying on social distancing, they’re probably going to do that one in a different way. But I would imagine when we make our decision, things like that would be opened up and then people will remember what they’re supposed to be doing. Well, I want to thank everybody very much and we’ll see you tomorrow sometime and we’ll get this going, I think really well. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it ."
"Thank you, Bill. Well that’s true. Well, I think when I started seeing and reading about China, and seeing what was going on in China, Wuhan specifically, it seemed to come mostly out of there, that area, the province. And when I saw that and I saw the death they were talking about on television, in the papers, and I started reading a lot about it. And really when I had to make a decision, do I stop people from China and specifically that area, but from China, to come into the country and everybody was against it, almost everybody I would say was just absolutely against it. We’ve never done it before. We never made a decision like that- No, there was instinct to know. We had a large group of people right behind me in the Oval Office and I made… I consulted with Mike, but we made a decision, I made a decision to close off to China. That was weeks early and honestly, I took a lot of heat. Sleepy Joe Biden said, “It’s xenophobic.” I don’t know if he knows what that means, but that’s okay. He said, “It’s racist,” what I did. Thousands and thousands of more people, probably tens of thousands, would be dead right now if I didn’t make that decision, and I must say doctors, nobody wanted to make that decision at the time. It was very, very early. Call it luck or call talent, it doesn’t matter, we made a great decision. I took a lot of heat from China, they weren’t happy with it. Now they understand it. They’ve really… We’re doing just fine, but they were not happy with it. I took a lot of heat from a lot of people. I really didn’t get- Yeah, when you say, I took a lot of heat for that, essentially. I really didn’t, I mean, a lot of people agree with me. Our country’s not supposed to be… It’s not built to shut down. Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy, they don’t want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space, it’s not for our country, we’re not built that way. And I said, “I don’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself,” the problem being obviously the problem. You can destroy a country this way by closing it down where it literally goes from being the most prosperous, I mean, we had the best economy in the history of our country three weeks ago and then all of a sudden was supposed to shut it down, and then we’re supposed to pay people not to go to work. We never had that. We used to pay people to go to work when we had a problem. Oh, it’s very tricky. It is, it is. Well, you have to make the decision. Look, we lose thousands, I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, “Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.” We have to get back to work. Now, with all of that being said, it’s incredible what the American people have done and honestly the American people have learned, we’ve all learned together between the shaking of the hands of the washing of the hands. Well, I used to wash my hands and I always wash my hands a lot, I never was a big believer in shaking hands, once I become a politician, you shake hands and you get a little bit used to it. Immediately when I see you, I apologize that I’m not shaking your hand. I never like to see that, actually. Yeah, more than that. Sure. I canceled the deal last night. I said, “I’m not going to sign that deal,” because Nancy Pelosi came in and put a lot of things in the deal that had nothing to do with the workers, that had to do with an agenda that they’ve been trying to get passed for 10 years. And I came in, I told Mike, I told a lot of people, “There’s no way I’m signing that deal.” I was getting calls from John Kennedy, from Ben Sasse, from many, many people, Lindsay, I was getting calls from a lot of different people saying this deal, Tom Cotton, this deal is terrible what they’ve done. They took a deal, we almost had a deal the day before and it was between Schumer and Mitch and it was really a good solid deal. All of a sudden they start throwing all of the little Green New Deal stuff in, right?  And the boardrooms, what they look like, and we want green energy, we want all this stuff, let’s stop drilling oil. They had things in there that were terrible, windmills all over the place and all sorts of credits for windmills. They kill the birds and ruin the real estate, right? A lot of problems. I mean a lot of problems. And I said, “I’m not signing this deal.”- Now they’ve renegotiated it- But we have great things for not only companies, forget the companies, the companies are nothing other than they are an employer of thousands and thousands of people and they pay them very well, we want to protect our workers. I want to protect our workers, workers first, but you have to protect companies like Boeing. They had a real bad year, let’s face it with the problems, and they were in trouble before this and then all of a sudden this happened.  We can’t lose a Boeing and we can’t lose some of these companies and companies, frankly Bill, that were solid as AAA companies because of what’s happened over the last couple of weeks, they go from AAA to being like they could use a hand. We can’t, right, we can’t lose those companies. If we lose those companies, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs. The faster we go back, the better it’s going to be. We have a pent up energy that’s going to be unbelievable. We’re going to bring it back fast, I really believe that. Sure. She’s great. Do I have an earplug here? If I can do that. Okay. Okay, well first of all I have to say that Harris is one of my favorite people and I didn’t hear a word she said and I was hoping it wasn’t too devastating a question, but she is a fantastic person. I have to say that. Okay, now that I’ve said it because I can’t hear Harris, but no, the bill is very much focused on the small business person. It’s very much focused on small companies including restaurants and all sorts of small companies, and what people don’t realize, you’re talking about these massive, we have the greatest companies in the world.  You add them all up and the small businesses are just about equal in size to these massive companies of which we have many, also. It’s the engine of our country, small business. This bill is absolutely aimed at the small business and the worker, and the workers of those small businesses and the owners, the owners are going to need help. They’re going to need some loans, they’re going to need things and we’re going to be able to take care of them because we don’t want those small businesses to go out of business, nor do we want the big businesses to go out of business. Well, I tell you, I never heard of such a thing. We’ve had flues where we lose 36,000, we’ve lost as many I guess as 78,000 people in one year.  And they came in and they said, “To be sure, we’re going to have to close the country,” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Well we have a virus. It’s coming in.” And I knew that and I made the early decision with China. So I already closed it off to China and that was a long time before they came in. But they came in, experts, and they said, “We’re going to have to close the country.” I said, “We’ve never closed the country before. This has never happened before.” I said, “Are you serious about this? We are going to take this country that’s fully employed. Well we have 160 million people working and you’re telling me we have to close it and people are going to go out of business and they’re going to go bankrupt and they’re not going to have jobs. What are we talking about here?”  This, don’t forget, this has never been done. We’ve had flues before, we’ve had viruses before. So this is something new and this is why I say we have to… I gave it two weeks and I guess by Monday or Tuesday is about two weeks, and we’ll assess at that time and we’ll give it some more time if we need a little more time, but we have to open this country up. Look, I accept things, I understand things very quickly. I mean, I understood exactly what they were saying, but we can socially distance ourselves and go to work and you’ll have to work a little bit harder. You can clean your hands five times more than you used to. You don’t have to shake hands anymore with people, that might be something good coming out of this. Although I must tell you as a politician, it’s a lot warmer when you walk into a crowd and you’re shaking a lot of people’s hands, you love those people. They loved me and I loved them, but it is a little bit colder. But you won’t be shaking hands for at least a while and things will happen. But we have to put the country to work. Look, you’re going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you’re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression, you’re going to lose people. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands, you’re going to have all sorts of things happen. You’re going to have instability. You can’t just come in and say, let’s close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far. When I came in, when I was elected, and you knew this number, China was going to overtake us in the year 2019, wasn’t even close. We went way up and they didn’t. We’ve done great. They pay us a fortune and tariffs and everything else, and yet we have a good relationship with them. We just signed a trade deal. But we’re the number one in the world by far. And now a few people walk into the Oval Office, say, “Sir, we have to close up the country.” I said, “What are you talking about?” … I said, what are you talking about? One of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made because I knew that when you do it, as soon as you do it, you’re going to drop. I mean, they’re talking about 20 or 25 points of GDP. Nobody’s ever heard of 25 points. If we went down a point, that’s a big deal. Now all of a sudden you’re basically turning off the country. I said, this has never been done before. What are you talking about? But we understand it, you have hotspots, but we’ve had hotspots before, we’ve had horrible flus. I mean, think of it, we average 36,000 people death, death. I’m not talking about cases. I’m talking about death. 36,000 deaths a year. People die, 36, from the flu, but we’ve never closed down the country for the flu. So you say to yourself, what is this all about. Now, it’s never been done. Not good. I wasn’t happy about it and I also knew that I had to do it. Look, with Turkey, I give this as an example, and Syria, I said, sign a deal with the Kurds, make peace. Erdogan, he didn’t want to. He’s a man who loves Turkey and I have a very good relation. I said, sign a deal. He didn’t really want to, the Kurds didn’t really want to, and it went on, the so-called safe zone, recently, few months ago. I said, sign a deal, do me a favor, sign the deal, get it done. They didn’t really want to. All of a sudden they start fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, and it was vicious and other countries got involved. Now I say, let’s sign a deal. They said, okay, we’ll sign a deal.  We needed a period because I don’t think if I would have not done it, we would have been unbelievably criticized for not doing it, but it’s never been done before. Bill, somehow the word got out that this is the thing we’re supposed to be doing. Now we’ve had some really bad epidemics and other things. I mean this pandemic, but we’ve had bad epidemics. I’m sure they could have been called pandemics. But we never did a thing like this before, but I had to do it. It’s been very painful for our country and very destabilizing for our country and we have to go back to work much sooner than people thought. And people can go back to work and they can also practice good judgment. What I said is perfect, was my conversation with the head of the Ukraine. That’s what I really said is perfect. Okay, that was another whole scandal, nonsense, a total witch hunt. But this one is a much different thing. We had other administrations, not just the last one, they built up a platform. They built up a test, but the test was no good. It didn’t handle large numbers of people. It was okay for a very small group but not for a large group. So we had to break it down- No, we did not screw up. I don’t think CDC screwed up either. They had a test that would have worked for a small group of people. In other words, for a normal problem. I don’t think anybody could have, in all fairness to CDC, and this is a big government agency and they’re very good people in there, but nobody ever expected a thing like this. Nobody would say that millions and millions of people would have been tested. So what we did is we broke that egg, we broke that system, and we’ve created a new system that now we’re doing unbelievably big numbers and it’s set for the future should we ever need it again. I hope we don’t need it again. Well, I think they’re actually coming together. We had a bill that was done the other night and then all of a sudden somebody else injected herself in and all … we didn’t have anything that was even remotely signable. But now I hear just from a few minutes ago that they’re doing well and it’s for the workers, it’s for the people of the country and I hear they’re doing pretty well, so we’ll see how it comes out. I watched Governor Cuomo and he was very nice. We’re building him hospitals. We’re building him medical centers and he was complaining about … we’re doing probably more, definitely more than anybody else. And he was talking about the ventilators, but he should have ordered the ventilators and he had a choice, he had a chance because right here, I just got this out that he refused to order 15,000 ventilators. I’ll show this to Bill, but take a look at that, Bill. What does that say? This says that New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So he had a chance to buy in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else, but he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We’re going to help. But if you think about, Governor Cuomo, we’re building him four hospitals, we’re building him four medical centers, we’re working very, very hard for the people of New York. We’re working along with him and then I watch him on the show complaining. And he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price that he didn’t buy them. Wow, is that great? Well, you obviously come from West Virginia. I love that state and thank you very much, Joyce. I’ll tell you what, that’s great. I wish we had more people like Joyce, I’ll tell you. But it’s going to be a substantial amount of money, around $3,000 for a family of four. And assuming it all gets done, assuming we can get the Democrats to sign it, but it’ll be great. But Joyce, I think that’s such a nice gesture, really I appreciate it, thank you. Well, I think the Dow was helped by the fact that there were theories that we’re going to stay out for four or five months and you can’t do that as a … you destroy our country if you did a thing like that. And we’re going to be opening relatively soon. Our time comes up, Monday or Tuesday are the allotted two weeks, but we’ll stay a little bit longer than that. But we want to get open very soon. I think that was a big reason it’s gone up. I also think that the fact that the Senate and the House, we seem to be getting along as much as you can get along. We seem to be getting along now on a bill. I think that may be had even less of an impact and the fact that we’re opening up this incredible country because we have to do that. I’d love to have it open by Easter, okay. I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this too. I would love to have the country opened up and they’re just raring to go by Easter. That’s very good. Oh, absolutely. Because he has other things to do. We get along very well. I think it’s been very good. You would have heard about it if it wasn’t. I mean, every time he’s not at a meeting, and sometimes other people too, they said, “Why isn’t a Dr. Birx at a meeting? Is there a problem?” And I said, “Debra, could you please come to the meeting? Do you mind?” Because I respect all of these people, these are great people and Debra is extraordinary and Tony’s extraordinary. I get along with all of them, but if there’s… they have other things to do. And yesterday we weren’t really talking about what he’s an expert on, we were talking about other things, a lot of other things. And I don’t think they should be at every news conference. Yeah, we’re fine. We’re fine. Harris, one thing I might add- Harris, one thing I might add, that to me is so important, again, we took something that was broken and we made it the model. And I didn’t even know, I just heard the number for the first time from Deborah, that in a short period of time, we’ve more testing than South Korea. Now you’re not going to read that in the newspapers because they don’t like to write things like that, but I’d love you to say that one more time because that’s a big number. We’ve done more than South Korea in a short period of time. We’re doing more now than South Korea by a lot . What was that number? We’re going up proportionately. We’re going up very, very rapidly. Every day we’re going up- Do you blame the governor for that? Thank you. It’s true. Yes. It’s okay. I think it’s possible, why isn’t it? I mean, we’ve never closed the country before and we’ve had some pretty bad flus and we’ve had some pretty bad viruses, and I think it’s absolutely possible. Now, people are going to have to practice all of the social distancing, and don’t shake hands and wash your hands and all of the things that we’re doing now, but we have to get our country back to work. Our country wants to be back at work. That was not a controversial thing I said the other day, our country wants to go back to work. And again, the cure, it’s like this cure is worse than the problem. Again, people, many people in my opinion, more people are going to die if we allow this to continue. We have to go back to work. Our people want to go back to go back to work. It may be. Well, they have their family fortune on the line the other way too. They’re going to lose their jobs, maybe never to get them back. They’re going to lose their businesses, never to get them back. We want to start up as soon as we can because we’re going to have a very quick comeback if we do that. If we delay this thing out, you’re going to lose more people than you’re losing with the situation as we know it. So, I think it’s very important for our-  The situation is we know it. So I think it’s very important for our country to go back. And I’ve had many, many people … When you said it was a little bit controversial, not to most people. Most people think I’m right about it. Now, whether we’re locked in a room or whether we’re in our office and practicing all of the things that we’re supposed to be a practicing, staying away from each other, et cetera, not shaking hands, washing your hands all the time. But our country has to get back to work, otherwise it’s going to be very hard to start it up again. We can’t lose the advantage that we have. Bill, excuse me, just one second. You can’t compare this to 1918 where close to a hundred million people died. That was a flu, which is a little different, but that was a flu where if you got it, you had a 50/50 chance or very close of dying. I think we’re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting. So we only know people that go to doctors and go to hospitals and we’re taking that and we’re still a little bit above 1%. When you add all of the people, the millions of people that have it that get better, we’re substantially less than 1%, and when they came to my office, don’t forget, they were saying 3%, 4%, 5%. There’s a very big difference. No, we have to put our country back to work. I do. I think doctor, it’s a very good thing and Governor Newsom and I have been getting along really great with sending the ship, the great hospitals ship, as you know, and we are doing very well with, I think almost all of the governors. For the most part, it really has become something, we are dealing almost every day with speaking to each other, whether it’s conference calls. Usually we’ll have 50 governors of the call at the same time. No, I think we’re doing very well, but you know, it’s a two-way street. They have to treat us well also. They can’t say, “Oh gee, we should get this. We should get that.”  We’re doing a great job like in New York where we’re building, as I said, four hospitals, four medical … We’re literally building hospitals and medical centers and then I hear that there’s a problem with ventilators. Well we sent them ventilators and they could have had 15 or 16000. All they had to do is order them two years ago, but they decided not to do it. They can’t blame us for that. Well I think doctor a thing like that could happen, but I really believe that we could do much of what we’re doing and we could do it from a work environment instead of an environment where everybody’s locked up and everybody is saying, “Oh, the business is gone, the business is gone,” and everybody’s suffering depression. You know better than anybody about depression. I’ve watched where you talk about depression and that causes death and it causes a lot of problems and these are people they want to save their business. They don’t want to be locked up in some room or some apartment or house, and in the meantime, their restaurants close, their businesses close. They want to be saving their business.  And I believe very strongly you’re going to lose far more people by going that way than you are if we kept this thing going. I could keep them out. I’m sure that we have doctors that would say, “Let’s keep it closed for two years, okay? Let’s close it up for two years.” No. We got to get it open. Our people want it open and that’s the way this country was built. And Nicole, it’s important to remember we’ve done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks. And our tests are better, they’re highly sophisticated and frankly I took one. It’s not the most pleasant thing in the world, I will tell you that. We’re going to have a much simpler test very soon, but we have a really good test and we’ve done more in eight days. Nobody knows that. I just heard this number a few minutes ago. I learned it from being on your show actually. Pretty impressive. And you hangar right. Hangar right under the eye. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. So, nice to be with you. America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus. I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat more aggressively. We commit to social distancing. So important social distancing, such an important phrase, and we do it right now the more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal. And there are large sections of our country probably can go back much sooner than other sections and we’re obviously looking at that also. People are asking, “Is that an alternative? And I say, “Absolutely. It is an alternative.”  I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. That has great significance as you know, and legal significance. We’re in a constant grouping and I can say this we have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials including, we’ve been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is by far the hottest spot. They’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them. The governor is doing a very good job. I spoke to the governor, Governor Cuomo, last night and this morning and he mentioned that in his remarks that he’s using, that we are using and I think he feels, cause he understands negotiation, he thinks we’re using very appropriately the Defense Production Act and we are. We’re using it where needed. It’s a great point of leverage. It’s a great negotiating tool. But I’ve really, I will tell you there’s tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies and I don’t have to use it very much at all. They want to do it. As you know, General Motors is involved, Ford’s involved, 3M’s involved, others are involved and they’re all working very hard to produce product, different, all different products. We had very little product when we came. We built it up and we give it away as fast as we can to the different states.  We’re also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas. In New York it’s at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center. We’re doing four hospitals and we’re doing throughout the state four medical centers there, somewhat different. I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I’m working very hard on New York. It’s really by far our biggest problem. Maybe it will be, maybe it won’t be, but there’s a lot of good capable people working on it with us and our teams are working very well with the state representatives. We’re also doing some very large testings throughout the country. I told you yesterday that in South Korea, and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon, we had a very good conversation about numerous other things, but they’ve done a very good job in testing but we now are doing more testing than anybody by far. We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks and we go up on a daily basis exponentially, so it’s really good.  By the way, while I’m on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night and I congratulated him on a wise choice. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics, 2021. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full beautiful Olympics. It’s going to be very important because it’s probably the first time, maybe ever or certainly in a long time that it was on a odd year. It’s always on an even year they tell me. But he’s going to have a fantastic success and now they’ll have even more time. He didn’t need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they’ve done. But Japan, I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. I told him I’ll be there, I’ll be there.  As we fight to protect American lives, we’re also protecting American livelihoods. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses. This legislation in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families, but we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers. And that’s a big thing, no cost to the employers. We want to get everybody back working. Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything I believe ever passed in Congress. Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back look during the FDR New Deal days there was something that if you time value it you could say it was bigger. I don’t know, but this is certainly in terms of dollars by far and away the biggest ever, ever done, and that’s a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs and families, families, families.  The Senate bill, as you know, includes $350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers. They continue paying their workers. That’s what we want. We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers. This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus. $300 billion in direct cash payments will be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year. That would be $3,400 very quickly for the typical family of four. Nothing like that’s ever been done in our country. Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible, so you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this.  Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our doctors, nurses and hospitals. They have been incredible. $45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund. We are setting up a fund, a $45 billion for disaster relief. That’s more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations. It’s a doubling up. $27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine because it was very depleted like our military was depleted. Now we have a brand new military. Never had a military like this. We have equipment either coming or it’s already come, for the most part it’s already come, but we have a lot of things that will soon be coming; planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things. But the stockpile was very depleted like everything else.  This will also include significant funding for the development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago. Over $500 billion in support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on and frankly I tell you the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that. We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch. And I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch. I think it’s going to, when we open, especially if we can open it the sooner the better, it’s going to open up like a rocket ship. I think it’s going to go very good and very quickly.  You’re going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also. They need the money. They’re going to have to sort of just make things work cause we’re interested in the workers, the jobs, and we’re interested in the companies cause that’s really what fuels the workers in those great jobs. We also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of personal protective equipment, you know about that, such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile.  I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature without delay. I will sign it immediately. We will have a signing and it’ll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and frankly for American companies, some of which were having the best years they’ve ever had, those last few years, and then little bit less than a month ago they went into a position that they haven’t seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus.  Earlier today I spoke to the leaders of many of America’s amazing nonprofit organizations. I thank them for their unwaving and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation. They have been fantastic. They’ve been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families. I encourage them to continue to do it, but I’ll tell you the nonprofits have been fantastic. They’ve been great. They’re great people actually. I know a lot of them.  Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies through FEMA. The federal government has delivered or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators, think of that 9.4 million, 20 million surgical masks and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly. The whole world, you know it’s not just us, it’s not just the states, the whole world is trying to get these things, so in competition with many, many countries. I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus. We have 150 countries, over 150 countries where you have this virus and nobody would ever believe a thing like that’s possible. Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know and we know it can happen and happen again. And if it does, somebody’s going to be very well prepared because of what we’ve learned and how we’ve done. It’s been incredible how we’ve done.  Remember, there’s more tests than anybody by far and the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea. They called me and they told me it’s amazing, your testing procedures are amazing. Plus we have a test that’s a very high level test and it’s a test that’s very accurate. 3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators which go to the areas of greatest needs. We sent over the last day 4,000 ventilators to New York and I spoke with the governor about that. He was happy. I spoke with the mayor also about that, Mayor de Blasio. He was very happy. It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing that I can tell you.  Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me. By the way, these people are amazing. They are amazing people and they become, I don’t know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me they’ve become friends. Maybe they don’t like me. Maybe they don’t. Maybe they do. I don’t know. All I can tell you is they’re talented people, they work very hard.  In Maryland, a seven-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens. In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable. This is happening all over the country, thousands and thousands of instances. I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things. In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the front lines fighting to save lives. These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle and it’s really a worldwide battle. We’re dealing with other nations all the time The people here are. I am a little bit. I take calls from a lot of people. They’re in trouble. A lot of countries are in big trouble.  So, now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury. He’s been working rather hard I will tell you. Steven Mnuchin is a fantastic guy and he loves our country and he’s been dealing with both sides, Republican and Democrats. He sort of lived over in that beautiful building. It’s a very beautiful building, to me one of the most beautiful buildings actually in the world, and he’s gotten to know it, Steve, very well. So if we could have a little update Steve would be fantastic as to how we’re doing and what it’s looking like. Thank you. Thank you very much, Steve. Great job. Day and night, right? Day and night we were . That was a lot of work and we’ll see how it all goes. We still need a vote, Steve, don’t we? Do you have a question? Yes. Hopefully a long time. You know, we’ll see. If we have to go back, we have to go back. We’re going to take care of the American worker. We’re going to take care of these companies that fuel this country and make the country great. It’s not their fault. It’s not their fault, but we think… And don’t forget, a lot of this is going to be to keep companies that are very strong, AAA-rated companies previously, to keep them going and it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. This money’s…  And it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. A lot of this money’s coming back. Yeah. Well, I’ve been saying that for a long time. Well, we’re reliant on many countries, where we give up our supply chains. We give up our factories. We give up our production facilities and we can buy it someplace else for a little bit lower price. But it’s really costing us more when that happens, because we lose jobs, we lose everything and we lose our independence and we can’t let that happen. So we’ll be making some changes. We have been making those changes. I don’t know that we’ll need that, but I think it’s happening by itself. I think a lot of things are happening. Well, we make the best medical equipment in the world, and you have some people like the European Union, they don’t take it because they have specifications that don’t allow our equipment in because it’s designed in a different way, even though it’s a better way. It’s designed. They’re all playing games against us, okay. They’ve been playing games against us for years and no president has ever done anything about it.  But the European Union, you look at medical equipment, we make the best medical equipment in the world, but we can’t sell it, or not appropriately. And yet we take their medical equipment in our country. We’re changing things, Steve. All of this is changing. But they have specifications, designed specifically, so that our equipment can’t come into their countries. It’s a very terrible thing that’s happened to our country.  And let me tell you some of the people that took the biggest advantage of us, our allies. We talk about allies, they took advantage of us in many ways, financially as well as even militarily. Look, if you look at NATO, the abuse that was given to our country on NATO, where they wouldn’t pay, and we were paying for everybody. Now, because of me, they’re paying a lot. Now, they’ve paid 125, 135, billion dollars more.  And then ultimately Secretary General Stoltenberg, who I think you would say is maybe my biggest fan, we got him to pay an additional $400 billion, billion, other countries. But you know that. And then there’s the trade. They make it almost impossible for us to have a fair deal. They know this. They know I’m just waiting. We have all the advantages, by the way. It’s going to be easy when I decide to do it, but this isn’t the right time to do it. But we’ve been treated very, very unfairly by the European union.  Please, go ahead. I know the issue very well. We talked about it just a little while ago. I’ll let, Steve, I’m going to let you maybe discuss that. The one good thing, when you think about that, people would get actually more money, but we don’t want to give a disincentive. But they have been talking about that. It’s a good question, actually. Yes, ma’am, please. I’ve been very much involved in that. He was a great gentleman and a great family. I have to say this and they’ve been making the statement to the family, I believe, but it’s not looking good. He wasn’t well for years, anyway, in Iran. It’s not looking promising. We’ve gotten so many people back. We got two people back this week, but Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, he’s been sick for a long time. He had some rough problems prior to his detainment or capture. We feel terribly for the family. No, I don’t accept that he’s dead. I don’t accept it. I’m telling you, it’s not looking great, but I won’t accept that he’s dead. They haven’t told us that he’s dead. But a lot of people are thinking that that is the case. Feel badly about it. What do you mean by election success? No. No, no, no. I think the media would like to see me do poorly in the election. Just so you understand. Are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly. I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. And I don’t know if that’s so, but I do think it’s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it’s very clear. I think it’s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me, for whatever reason, because we’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody’s done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here, right now, for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left. Okay.  Go ahead in the back, please. Who you with? I think it’s pretty much, yeah. I don’t know that that subject’s going to come up. There is a lot of talk that that’s how this all happened. Came out of China, and they say that’s how it happened in China. So it’s something maybe it will be talked about, but it’s not the top of my list. I think we’re going to have a very good conference tomorrow. No, but we have tested more than anybody. I saw him. Yeah. How many? None. Okay. How many deaths are acceptable to me? None. Okay. None. If that’s your question. Look, I saw him. I saw his statement. We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They’re the most accurate tests. But if you’re saying we’re going to test 350 million people, I watched his statement, I disagree with it.  We can go to certain States. I could name them now, but I’m not going to do that. But we can go to certain States right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem. We don’t have to test the entire state in the Middle West or wherever they may be. We don’t have to test the entire state. I think it’s ridiculous. We don’t have to do it. A lot of those States could go back right now and they probably will, because at some point in the not too distant future, certain States are going to come off the rolls. Maybe New York can’t and maybe California can’t. Maybe the state of Washington can’t. Although if you look at them, their biggest problem was in one nursing home. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, you’re going to look at that. But if you take a look at the States and many States that I’m talking about, they don’t have a problem. We have some big problems, but it’s confined to certain areas, high density areas. So why would we test the entire nation, 350 people? With that being said, I’m going to say it again, we tested far more than anybody else. We have the ability to test… we’ve come a long way from an obsolete, broken system that I inherited. We have now tested, with the best test, far more than anybody else. When I say anybody else, I’m talking about other countries. No country is even close.  They came out with a statistic, I guess a yesterday, that I heard from Dr. Burks where it’s for eight days here, more than eight weeks in South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job, but we did in eight days more than South Korea did in eight weeks. That’s a big number. And we’re getting, I said before, exponentially better. Every day is going up substantially. We have an incredible apparatus built, now. But no, I don’t want to test 350 million people. I think it’s ridiculous.  Yes, please. With respect to what? Look, we have strong borders. Before I came here, we weren’t into borders. We had a country people could come in. We had a whole different deal. Now we’re up to almost 164 miles. Think of that, 164 miles of wall, big beautiful wall and in those areas it’s very, very tough to come in. We’ve been very tough on the borders. Where we have the wall built, nobody’s getting through. Now, they’re going around, but that’s a long trip. If they’re going around, that’s the way they get through. No, I’m very strong on borders and I don’t want people coming in here. What I want is, if they’re going to come in, they have to come in legally. They have to come in through merit. We’re not having the people that you’re talking about coming to our country. Please. Well, I approved that. And I knew… it was 35 million and we actually took off 10. But I’m a fan of that, although I haven’t spent time there because I’m far too busy. I’d love to go there evenings, but I’m too busy doing things, because that’s more important for me than going there. But the Kennedy Center has suffered greatly, because nobody can go there. It’s essentially closed. They do need some funding. I said, look, that was a Democrat request. That was not my request, but you’ve got to give them something. It’s something that they wanted. It works that way. Democrats have treated us fairly. I really believe that we’ve had a very good back and forth. And I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer. I spoke to him a number of times, but they had requests also. So that was a request.  There were 35, as you know, and it came down to 25. We got it down to 25. We agreed. I said, “That’s a lousy soundbite. That’s not a good sound bite.” But that’s the way life works. With that being said, the Kennedy Center, they do a beautiful job, an incredible job. David Rubenstein does a fantastic job. He’s very much involved and he puts up a lot of money and he does things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do, or do. But they’ve been essentially closed. They have tremendous deficits that are built up. This thing has been devastating to it. So I didn’t have a big problem with it, but this was a request from the Democrats, because of the fact that they have a facility that’s essentially closed up. Otherwise you couldn’t go there if you wanted to. If I wanted to go there tonight to look at Romeo and Juliet, I’d love to see Romeo and Juliet tonight. You know what would happen? They say, “Sorry.” 250 people or 50 people, whatever it might be down to. Go ahead. I think there is certainly a lot of talk that has been very unfair. I think that a lot of people feel that it’s been very unfair. It’s been very, very much sided with China and a lot of people are not happy about it. At the same time, Dr. Fauci and myself and other people, there are people on there that we like and we know. A lot of, I think your friends, are on there. A lot of good people, a lot of good professionals. I don’t know, it’d be interesting to hear if you’d like to talk about the WHO, but the fact is that, I have heard for years that that is very much biased toward China. So I don’t know.  Dr., you want me to get you into this political mess? Welcome to the group. Let me just tell you, I have heard that for years. I spoke to him yesterday. Seems fine to me. I don’t know. But we’re the ones that gave the great response and we’re the ones that kept China out of here. And if I didn’t do it, you’d have thousands and thousands of people who would have died, that are now living and happy. If I didn’t do that early call on China, and nobody wanted that to happen. Everybody thought it was unnecessary to do it, and if we didn’t do that, thousands and thousands of people would’ve died, more than what’s happened. So that’s it. Maybe one more. Steve, go ahead. No coordinated… we’re going to have a meeting with the 20 nations total, including us. It’ll be a conference call tomorrow morning sometime. I look forward to people I know, I like. I think in every instance I like every one of them, but it’ll be an interesting call. You’ll be the first to know. We’ll be talking. I’ll be speaking with Tony. I’ll be speaking with Deborah. I’ll be speaking with some of the people that they like and respect, and they’re going to bring along with them. We’ll be speaking to Vice President Mike Pence and Steve, and we’ll be speaking to everybody. I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily. I don’t do that. But the country wants to get back to work. Our country was built to get back to work.  We don’t have a country where they say, “Hey, let’s close it down for two years.” We can’t do that. It’s not our country. So we’re going to be talking, and it could be we’ll do sections of our country. There’s big sections of our country that are very little affected by what’s taken place. Then there are other sections that are very heavily affected, so there’s a big difference. But no, I would say by Easter we’ll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter, and at the end of the 15th day or even during the 15th day, I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to…  Did they? I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to work, Steve. I have had so many people and they want to practice social distancing and they want to practice no handshaking, no handshaking. They’re not going to go walk around hugging and kissing each other in the office where they come back. Even though they may feel like it. They’re going to do, they’re going to wash their hands more than they’ve ever done. They’re going to do all the things you’re supposed to do. But Steve, you know what? It’s time. They want people want to get back to work. I’m having, I get it from both sides. In all fairness, and maybe it’s a combination of both. Tony said before, combination of both is sometimes very good, but there are areas that possibly, probably they won’t qualify.  There are other areas that qualify almost now. So we’re going to have to see what happens, but it’ll be an interesting period of time. I’d like to get our country back. I have tremendous numbers of people wanting to go back. You have store owners where the store is sitting there, they don’t know what’s happened. They got to get back. You have businesses that are going to be closed. The longer we stay out, the longer we do it. We want to go quickly. The longer we stay out, the harder it is to bring this incredible, we were having the most successful years that we’ve ever had in the history of our country. You saw what happened yesterday with the stocks and today they’re up. I’m telling you, if Steve gets the deal done, the incredible incentive that’s going to take care of people, it’s going to take care of our workers, going to take care of companies that employ all these workers. Small and big.  By the way, I would say we spend more time on the small companies, Steve, than we did under big companies. People ask about that. We spent more time thinking about the small businesses than the big and that’s, but that really fuels our country. We want to get back and the people want to get back. We want to get our country going again and we’ll be able to do that. So Vice-President is going to stay with you and going to take a few more questions specifically and I will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much. "
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful day. Very good, what you’re doing, look at all those empty seats. Never seen it like that. Oh, boy. Oh, how the world has changed. How the world has changed, right? But it’s going to end up being better than ever. I want to thank you very much for being here and I’d like to update you on the steps we’re taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus. This morning at 7:55 AM, I spoke to the leaders of the G20, had a great meeting and we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas, we’re working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that right now a 151 nations have got. We had President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Xi of China, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Modi of India, President Widodo of Indonesia, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.  Congratulations to Japan, on making a great decision on the Olympics, going to make it next year, 2021. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico. I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border and very few people are getting through, I can tell you that. We got to keep it that way. And we have a great relationship with Mexico now. President Putin of Russia, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in, South Korea. We’re working very hard on that. Prime Minister Sanchez of Spain, President Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Council Charles Michel, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom, World Bank President David Malpass, and the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.  So that’s a big group, but it’s a great group, and they were all there, every one of them. And we talked about the problem and hopefully it won’t be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts. We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data. And we’ve been doing that to a large extent, but we’ll do it even more so, and to inform our, I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other, it’s a little bit different, but we’re handling it a little bit in different ways. But there is great uniformity I think, we had a… it was a terrific meeting, tremendous spirit among all of those countries. You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned, and a tremendous spirit to get this over with.  After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories. Our team as a been in constant communication with the governors and we had a terrific meeting. Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.” I said, “Yeah, he meant that in a positive way.” He said, “We need Tom Brady.” We’re going to do great and he meant it very positively, but they took it differently. They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort. That’s only fake news, and I like Tom Brady, spoke to him the other day. He’s a great guy. But I wish the news could be real, I wish it could be honest, I wish it weren’t corrupt, but so much of it is. It’s so sad to see. Just so sad to see. We had a great meeting. I’ll tell you what, I’m sure you have tapes of the meeting. I’m sure that you were able to get tapes, very easily see it 50 governors plus.  And if you had tapes you’d see it was really, I mean, there was no contention, I would say virtually none. I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy a little bit, but he’s usually a big wise guy, not so much anymore. We saw to it that he wouldn’t be so much anymore, but he is… we had a… I mean I would rate, Mike was there, a lot of the folks in the back were there, and it was a great meeting. Took place at about 12 o’clock. So we went from the G20 to the governors, we also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we’re moving through Congress to deliver much needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses. I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to zero, and I have to say it’s the largest by far. And I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need.  The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay. I think it’s got tremendous support when you’re at 96 to nothing. And, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined and one, Ryan Paul, he’s actually got it, but he’ll be better. He’s been a great guy. He’s been a great friend of mine actually. The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Loan forgiveness, keep the workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year. $3,400 for the typical family of four. Expanded unemployment benefits, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months.  These are things that, by the way, we have plenty more to go and, but there are things that nobody’s ever had any package like this done, and I just want to thank them. Hopefully it’ll get approved equally easily in the House. Really, I think it will go through pretty well from what I hear. Virtually everybody, there could be one vote, one vote, one grand stander maybe, you might have one grand stander. And for that we’ll have to come back and take a little more time, and it’ll pass, it’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grand stander. Critical support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse. Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses and hospitals, $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, more than doubling the amount available, this is tremendous stuff. $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the strategic national stockpile, with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals.  $3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare, the benefits to healthcare workers, first responders and others on the front lines of the crisis, and these are really brave, incredible people I have to say. And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don’t even recover. They’re incredible people. $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement. We are, as you know, using the act, but we use it only when necessary. We use it as leverage, we generally don’t have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish. As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million n95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and we’re sending more every day and we’ve got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in. A lot of great companies are making equipment right now. The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them and we’re going to be in great shape.  We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place in a lot of ways. As you know, the testing is going very, very well, and that was obsolete and broken and we fixed it, and it’s been going really good. And I think very importantly, the stockpile, we’re really filling it up and we fill it up rapidly. But we get it out, sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead. And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also. We’re sort of a… we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing and if they need help, we do it, but it’s their first responsibility. Sometimes they just can’t get it, but we load it up and we send it out, but if we can, we have it sent directly to the state. We want it to go directly to the point where we want it.  I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they’ve done in the Navy, because the incredible Naval hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, which is incredible actually when you see it inside, will be underway to New York city on Saturday. So it’s going to be leaving on Saturday rather than three weeks from now. They did the maintenance quickly and it was going to be there for quite a while longer, another three or four weeks, and it should be arriving. I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving at New York Harbor on Monday. I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye. I’ll go to, it’s in Virginia as you know, and I will go and we’ll be waving together, because I suspect the media will be following. Johnny, you going to be following? Maybe, you never know, huh? It’s a great chip. It’s a great vessel, that’s right. So if you want to go, I’ll see you there, and if you don’t, that’s okay. After being fully loaded with medical supplies, it’s going to be, it’s loaded up to the top and it’s over at the Norfolk Naval Base, that’s where it departs. It is expected then to, I mean we’re saving about three to four weeks by the incredible work done by the Navy, and I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go. The ship will arrive and I believe it’s going to get a little bit of a ceremony. There’s something very beautiful about it. It’s an incredible piece of work. Going to be landing at Pier 90 in Manhattan to provide hospital surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area, so it’s a surge capacity. They may use it for this or they may have other people coming in from hospitals unrelated to the virus and then they’ll use those hospitals on land, they’ll use those hospital for the virus, but we’ll see how they do it. They could do it either way, one way or the other, whichever one is best.  But it could be, because it’s set up so well for a regular hospital, that they may take people out of hospitals and then use those rooms for the virus. The National Institute of Health and the private sector, working closely with the FDA, continue to collaborate to discover and test treatments and therapies that can effectively reduce the duration and symptoms of the virus and help, very much help, people to recover. And I’m firmly committed to bringing these treatments to market very quickly. We have a lot of tests going on with regard to different medicines, and I hope we get lucky. I hope we hit… a lot of talented scientists and doctors are working on therapeutics, a cure, vaccines. I think we’re doing very well. Tony may speak to that a little bit later, but I think we’re doing very well with regard to the vaccines. I think we’re doing well with regard to a lot of the things I just mentioned, but we’ll have to see what happens. We’re going to know fairly soon about a lot of them.  But it’s very advanced and the vaccines are very advanced prior to, as you know, a fairly reasonably long test period of, in that case, over a year. Every American should be proud of the incredible spirit our country has brought to this effort. It’s been incredible. Citizens from all walks of life have come together to turn the tide in this battle. We’re witnessing the extraordinary of American unity like a lot of people have never seen, even getting a vote. You’re talking about trillions of dollars and you get to a vote of 96 to nothing. We are waging war on this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical and military resource to halt it’s spread and protect our citizens. I want to express our tremendous thanks to the American people for continuing to practice social distancing like you people are practicing right here. I don’t know, this room may never be the same. Maintaining good hygiene and follow government guidelines. Vice President Pence lifts up that card every time, and it’s not very complicated, but hopefully you can do that. And your commitment will make all the difference in the world, and that’s one of the big ones will be for awhile, stay home. Just relax, stay home. Making a lot of progress as we continue to gather more information and accelerate the testing where we’re doing record numbers of tests now, far more than any other country has done. I told you yesterday, eight days here, because you heard so much about South Korea, the media kept of themself, South Korea, South Korea, we have a great relationship with president Moon and South Korea. But when I hear so much about South Korea, so in eight days we do more testing than they did in eight weeks, and it’s a very highly sophisticated test. We’ll be able to deploy even more data-driven and targeted approaches to slow the… ultimately it’s a very devastating thing, but we will vanquish this virus, and a lot of progress has been made.  That’s why earlier today I sent a letter to Americas governors describing how we will be using the data to update existing guidance on social distancing, which will be developed in close coordination with our nation’s public health officials and scientists. Because of the sacrifices of our great doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals, the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and the goodness and generosity of our people, I know that we will achieve victory and quickly return to the path of exceptional health, safety and prosperity for all of our citizens.  We have to get back to work. Our people want to work, they want to go back. They have to go back and we’re going to be talking about dates, we’re going to be talking with a lot of great professionals. But this is a country that was built on getting it done and our people want to go back to work. I’m hearing it loud and clear from everybody, so we’ll see what happens. We’re going to have a lot more information early next week and we’ll be reporting that back, but I just want to leave it with you, we have to go back. This is the United States of America, they don’t want to sit around and wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people-  And then wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people misinterpret when I say go back. They’re going to be practicing, as much as you can, social distancing and washing your hands and not shaking hands, and all of the things that we talk about so much. But they have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that. And I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress is made, but we got to go back to work.  We may take sections of our country, we may take large sections of our country that aren’t so seriously affected and we may do it that way, but we’ve got to start the process pretty soon. So we’ll be talking to you a little bit more about that next week. And with that, if you have any questions you could ask. And then I’m going to have vice president stay behind and he’s going to take questions and also introduce some of the people. You can ask them some questions. John, please. No, not at all. Well, it’s a nobody’s fault, certainly not in this country. Nobody’s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China at a very early date. I say that because some people don’t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country. Or the numbers that you’re talking about, we’re a big country, they’d be far greater, far, far bigger.  So when I heard the number, I mean, I heard it could be six million, could be seven million. It’s 3.3 or 3.2, but it’s a lot of jobs. But I think we’ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work, every day that we stay out, it gets harder to bring it back very quickly. And our people don’t want to stay out. So I know those numbers, John, but I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy, as I say, it’s a hidden enemy. Sometimes a hidden enemy is a lot tougher than somebody that stares you in the face, right? So we’ll see what happens. But, I mean, they’re fully expected numbers, at least. I mean, at least. Steve, please. Well, we have very strong deployments on the Southern border, as you know, with Mexico. And we had some troops up in Canada, but I’ll find out about that. I guess it’s equal justice to a certain extent. But in Canada, we do have troops along the border. We have a lot of things coming in from Canada. We have trade, some illegal trade that we don’t like. We have very strong sanctions on some, we have very strong tariffs on dumping steel.  And we don’t like steel coming through our border that’s been dumped in Canada so they could avoid the tariff. I charge a lot of tariff for the steel, and it’s been great for our steel companies because now they can really go. You look at what’s happened with steel, it’s been pretty incredible. But we’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs on steel, and much of it comes in from China, but they can come through the Canadian border too, so we’re always watching for that. No, I think it’s a tribute to our testing. Number one, you don’t know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers and … I’m speaking to President Xi tonight. I believe that we’ll have a good conversation, I’m sure. But you just don’t know. What are the numbers?  But I think it’s a tribute to the testing. We’re testing tremendous numbers of people and every day, the way the system works, and I want to thank especially, Roche has been fantastic, a great company. They’ve done a tremendous amount … Deborah was telling me before that they were really, they’ve really stepped up to the plate and done great, as have other of the companies. But it seems that they’re really doing it particularly well. So we’ll see what happens there. But it’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing. We’re doing tremendous testing. And I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing, and I think that’s a little hard. No, I didn’t say that. No, you’re wrong. I didn’t say that. I said some people were projecting that it would be six or seven and it’s, I believe, 3.3. I mean, the things I just read to you are being considered and other things are being considered. People are going to be getting big checks and it’s not their fault. What happened to them is not their fault. So we’re doing a lot of different things on health insurance. We have meetings on it today. We’re taking care of our people. This is not their fault what happened, and we’re taking care of … We’re starting off by sending them very big checks. I think for a family of four, it’s about $3,000. And we’re taking care of our people, we’re taking care of our workers. As I say, this was not a financial crisis. This was a health crisis, a medical crisis. We’re going to take care of our people. Please. Yeah. Well, I hate to … I know the business very well. I understand the restaurant business is a very delicate business. It’s a business that is not easy. I always say, in a restaurant business, you can serve 30 great meals to a person or a family and they love it. One bad meal, number 31, they never come back again. It’s a very tough business, but they’re great people that run restaurants.  And I’ve heard 3% could be lost and you could go as high as 10 or 11%, but they’ll all come back in one form or another. It might be a different restaurant, but it’s going to be a great business for a lot of people. And we’re making it easy for people to … Look, what we’re doing in terms of loans, what we’re doing in terms of salaries, they’ll all come back. It may not be the same restaurant, may not be the same ownership, but they’ll all be back. Yes, sir. Please. Well, I talked about the Defense Production Act a lot and I’ve enacted it. I have it. I can do it with a pen. And we have actually used it on two minor occasions, and then we could withdraw it. But for the most part, the companies, we don’t need it. We say we need this and they say, don’t bother, we’re going to do it.  I mean, we’re dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We’re dealing with great companies. They want to do this, they want to do this. They’re doing things that, frankly, they don’t need somebody to walk over there with a hammer and say, do it. They are getting it done. They’re making tremendous amounts of equipment, tremendous amounts. And when this is over, we’re going to be fully stockpiled, which they would have never been except for a circumstance.  This was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I’m not even blaming … Look, we inherited a broken situation, but I don’t totally blame the people that were before me and this administration. Nobody would’ve ever thought a thing like this could have happened. But the production act, Defense Production Act is a wonderful thing, but I just haven’t had to use it. They know it’s activated. They know I can use it. Maybe that frightens them a little bit. It’s got tremendous power, but I haven’t had to. Please. Where are they? They were all outside trying to get in. I know. So I’m a big fan of Senator Holley and I also like the idea. There were some senators that didn’t want to do anything like Carnival, great company, but they’re based in different places. I won’t tell you why. I could tell you exactly where they’re based, but I won’t do that. But they’re based in actually more than one places, as ships are registered in different locations.  I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. It’s very tough to make a loan to a company when they’re based in a different country, but with that being said, they have thousands and thousands of people that work there, and maybe almost as importantly, that work on shore filling these ships with goods and products. And the cruise line business is very important. And I know Carnival, what a great job they do, Micky Arison. And I would think that we could stick with Senator Holley and maybe really look at that very seriously.  Look, it’s a big business, it’s a great business. It’s a business that employs tremendous number of people outside of the ship itself. I mean, you look at these ports, it’s loaded up with shops and people that are involved with the ship. So we’re going to work very hard on the cruise line business and we’re going to try and work something out, but I like the concept. Yeah, go ahead. So the airline business is a very tough business, over many years. It’s been very, very tough. It’s got everything. It’s got labor, it’s got very strong, powerful … You look at the cost of these airliners. Everything is tough. Very highly technological, you look at how complicated, how complex. It’s got unions, it’s got everything. The airline business, generally speaking, it’s a very tough business, always been a very tough business.  With that being said, we have to keep our airlines going. And we’re going to be using some … Now maybe we’ll take a piece of the airlines for the country, for our country, where we loan money and we take a piece. It’s all fully ready, we’re ready to go. But if we didn’t do that, we’d end up with no airlines and we can’t do that. The airline business is very vital to our country. It’s a tough business. We have to understand that. I mean, I could tell you other businesses that are different kinds of business, they are very good businesses, but airlines have always been very, very tough. Please. No, please. Yeah, I didn’t call you, I called this gentleman. Who are you with? Who are you with? Yeah, Bloomberg. How’s Michael? Doing good? No, I didn’t. I’m speaking to him tonight. It’s scheduled to go tonight. I’ll have a call with President Xi of China. A very good relationship. No, I didn’t like when they came up, and it wasn’t him. Somebody at a lower level, mid level, we found out pretty much. But they made a statement that our soldiers brought it into China. No, it came from China.  And we just signed a very big deal with China. They’re paying us a lot of money in tariffs and other things. They never paid us 25 cents. Look, China has taken advantage of the United States, until I came here, with sleepy Joe Biden and Obama and Bush and everybody else. I’m not blaming them, I’m blaming everybody. They were allowed to, $500 billion a year they were taking out. We had trade deficits that were so large, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, and we’ve changed it.  Look, now we’re taking in billions of dollars and we gave some to our farmers, because China, they targeted our farmers. And our farmers are very happy and our farmers got through a very rough period because of what I was able to do. Took the money from China and gave it to the farmers and we had plenty of leftover after that. Now we’re going into a phase two negotiation with China, but we’re getting 25% on $250 billion, and then we’re getting a lot on money after that.  So we’ve never had to deal with China. China took advantage of the United States. And you know what? I don’t blame China for that. I blame the people that were right here, because they should have never allowed it to happen. But the relationship with China has been a very good one. John? He never asked me to calm it down, no. Somebody might’ve spoken to somebody, but nobody spoke to me about it. I think it was time though, because I talk about the Chinese virus, and I mean it. That’s where it came from. If you look at Ebola, if you look at all … lyme, right? Lyme, Connecticut. You look at all these different horrible diseases, they seem to come with the name, with the location. And this was the Chinese virus. But I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it. We’ll see.  But we just made a great deal with China. Great, hopefully, for both parties. But we’ve made a deal with China and we’re going to do another one it looks like. They want to do it very badly. Maybe they’ll want to wait, like Iran. They want to wait to see whether or not Trump gets beaten in the election, because would they love to negotiate with Biden or somebody else other than me. They would love it. That’s their best dream in the world. So many others. So there are some that maybe are waiting until after November 3rd, the election day.  But I think we’re doing very well. It would be sad if we blew all of the advantages that we have right now, because we’ve made unbelievable trade deals. Whether it’s Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, and others, we have changed the whole thing around. Please. I think Deborah will talk to you about that, and Tony in a few minutes. But I think we’ll start talking about that, because we have to open up. We can’t say, let’s close. People don’t want to close, John. I say it again and again. The reason I do, because I want you to report it eventually. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead, Steve. Yeah, it’s his call. I mean, I’ll talk to him, whatever he wants to … We’ll have, I think, a very fruitful call, have a good call tonight at nine o’clock. Please. We’ll be talking about that. Yeah, we’ll be talking about the virus. In the back first, please. Yeah, record. No, not yet. It hasn’t passed, but it’s come a long way. I think they think we’re doing a really good job in terms of running this whole situation having to do with the virus. I think they feel the administration, myself and the administration, are doing a good job of keeping very important people informed. Because it was a great fear and a lot of good things are happening.  The mortality rate is at a, in my opinion, you’ll have to speak to Deborah, Tony, all of the others, but in my opinion, it’s way, way down and that takes a lot of fear out. It’s one thing to have it, it’s another thing to die. When I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number that seems to be. And remember that people that have it … many people have it. I just spoke to two people, they had it. They never went to a doctor. They had it, absolutely had it, but they never went to a doctor. They never went to any of that. They didn’t report it. You have thousands and hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the-  … hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the case load also. And the people that actually die, that percentage is a much lower percentage than I ever thought. That’s one of the reasons I say, look, we’re going to beat this and we’re going to get back to work. Yes, please. Sounds appropriate. Well, no. No, we don’t look at a weak point. This is a serious problem for over 150 nations, the virus. I would say this. Maduro and Venezuela, we’re watching it very closely. We’ll see what happens. But that is correct. Those charges were made. Please. We will give you that notification. We’ll let you know. I want those guidelines to go even when we’re open and fully operational, and frankly, much of the guidelines like shaking hands, maybe people aren’t going to be shaking hands anymore. Tony had mentioned to me, Tony Fauci, the other day that I don’t think he would be too upset with the concept of not shaking hands. He was saying that the flu would cut down, the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t shake hands. Even the regular flu, of which we have a lot of deaths and a lot of problems with that too. So I think a lot of great things are going to… When we’re open, as soon as we open, that doesn’t mean you’re going to stop with the guidelines. You’ll still try and distance yourself, maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life. But I think the time is coming. How about one more question? Go ahead, in the back. Yes, I do. Very important to me. Very important to me. We have to protect our Asian Americans. It’s very important, that was a very important tweet to me because I didn’t like things that I was hearing. Please go ahead. Well I don’t know. All I know is this. Asian Americans in our country are doing fantastically well. I’m very close to them as you know, and they’re doing fantastically well. And I think they appreciate the job we’re doing, but I did want to put that statement out, the social media statement, because to me Asian Americans are a great part of our country. Thank you all very much. We’ll see you soon. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Great to have you, and thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It’s been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world. We’ve had great success over the last month. We’ve, as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us, purchased and delivered, and we’ve made it available to the states and the governors have been very gracious, for the most part, I would say. A couple that aren’t appreciative of the incredible job, they have to do a better job themselves. That’s part of the problem. But generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he’s very thankful and Governor Cuomo has been very nice.  They’ve really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done, you look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. It’s been really incredible. Nobody has seen it. They’ll build hospitals in two or three days, portable hospitals. This afternoon I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal and we’ve delivered thousands of them, and oftentimes you don’t need ventilators very much, hospitals don’t have very many, and now we’re turning out that we have to produce large numbers, but we’ve been able to do that and we’re going to be doing a lot more. This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had a deal with, as an example, General Motors and I guess they thought otherwise they didn’t agree and now they do.  They do agree and I think we might be able to pull it, but we let them know the way we felt and they can’t be doing that. We’ll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists and it’s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available awful authorities to get the job done. This afternoon I also signed an executive order investing, and very, very strongly investing the Department of Health and Human Services, and the department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus, the invisible enemy, as we say. My order also establishes that Peter Navarro, a very trusted person from the White House and he’s been an incredible … He’s done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going economically, but my order establishes that Peter will serve as national Defense Production Act policy coordinator for the federal government.  That’s a very important position, more important probably than it’s almost ever been in our country, and so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It’s a … I know he’s going to do a fantastic job. He’s been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter is a PhD in economics from Harvard, has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard, and he’s a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job. But I’d like to maybe ask before I continue Peter to say a few words, please. Thank you, Peter. Good luck. My administration is marshaling the full power of the American government and we will do that and that’s what we’ve done and we will continue to do it until our war is won. Economic, scientific, medical, military and Homeland Security. All of this to vanquish the virus. We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Phillips, Medtronic, Hamilton, Zol, Resmed, Hillrob and Viar. These are all companies that do this, great companies, the FDA will be reducing and waving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done, we’re going to be getting rid of certain, let’s say, barriers to speed. We want them to get it done quickly. They’ve been doing it for a long time. They’ve been making ventilators for a long time. Hopefully General Motors will join in the fray, under the normal condition that you would be.  Regular times, 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year. In the next 100 days … Well, first of all we’ve already delivered thousands of them, but within the next 100 days we will either make or get in some form over 100,000 additional units. And I guess to put it in other words, in the next 100 days we’ll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States. And that doesn’t include all of the thousands and thousands that we’ve given to the various states, a lot of them.  We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn’t know they got them. And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse and that was also for New York and they just found out that they were there. So we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed. Earlier today I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun, and Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the front lines. These are actually pretty intricate in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials. They’re important. They’ve got to be top of the line and they’ll go into do thousands of these a week. They’ve already tested the production and they’re ready to begin producing all of these shields. It’s the plastic shields that go over the face. Boeing is also offering us the use of their, what they call the dream lifter cargo plane.  It’s the largest plane in the world and this is sort of a picture of it. They called up just a little while ago and that can sort of take anything, that’s the biggest in the world and they’re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product, and Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we needed. Each plane can carry 63, 000 pounds of cargo per flight. That’s a lot of cargo.  I also signed an executive order giving the Department of defense and Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces. This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees. We have a lot of people, retirees, great, great military people, they’re coming back in who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need. And they come back in. They don’t say, “How much?” They don’t say, “What are we getting paid?” They just want to come back in. It’s really an incredible thing to see. It’s beautiful.  This afternoon I also signed into law 2.2 trillion dollars in urgently needed relief for our nation’s families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. And the 2.2 trillion goes to 6.2 trillion depending on need. So it’s the largest bill ever signed and not just emergency relief, but of any kind. We’ve never signed a bill of that magnitude, and incredibly it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in congress, they did it very quickly in the house. They did it very, very quickly.  So if you look at Congress, what they’ve been able to do, the house was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place, and 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country. That’s pretty good. And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation and this is a great thing, a great victory. This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened. A month ago, they were outstanding. They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit and so we’ll help them out. It’s thousands and millions of jobs, millions of jobs. And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard. And that includes the people standing with me right here.  The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses, and a big focus of the bill is small businesses. They’re really … They’re the energy, they’re whatever you want to call it in terms of our nation that push … People have no idea how big a factor Peter can tell you, the small businesses are in this country from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint. We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct cash payments will be going to American citizens. Substantial. This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the disaster relief fund, and critical supplies including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types. And speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we’re working on vaccines. We’re getting some good response and we’re working on therapeutics and cures and we have some very interesting things happening. This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC and FEMA. Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free C-O-V-I-D dash 19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors. It’s getting to be a very modernized system indeed. They’ll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not. And again, we only want people to get tested if they … If we think they need it. In a few moments. Secretary Devoss and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed. They’ve both been incredible, the job they’ve done. I appreciate them very much. We’re grateful for the assistance of Niren Chadhaury, CEO of Panera Bread Company, they’ve been so incredible to us and to the people of our country. And Denton McClain, chairman of McClain Global Logistics, and they’ve joined us. They’re on stage with me. They’re going to speak.  Throughout this ordeal, I’ve been ordered and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else. Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines shown incredible compassion and sacrifice greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens. I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives and I want them to know, and I’ve said it before, that I’m very proud to be their president, I’m very proud of the American people. My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all out war against this horrible virus. We’re now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day, more than anybody in the world and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world, and our capacity continues to grow.  Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus and we’re doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that and coordinate with the States to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-based approach. It’s all data driven. This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders. We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them. Each location is different. Some are very, very different. Some are day and night, some are in great shape and some aren’t in great shape, and we’ll be able to have very accurate information very shortly. We already have a lot of that information. America’s bravely battling this pandemic through cutting edge science and medical innovation and rational, deliberate and determined vigilance.  No effort will be spared in winning this war. We’re going to win the war. Hopefully we’re going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost. You see what’s going on all over the world, you see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell and we’re all in very strong communication. I can tell you our professionals are dealing with them every day. Many of the countries, so many countries, but many of the countries we’re dealing very directly and closely, and we’re going to be in very good shape in terms of certain equipment that’s very hard to get, very hard to manufacture, and at the right time will be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries.  Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today, as you know, Boris is … He’s tested … Unfortunately he’s tested positive and it’s a terrible thing, but he’s going to be great. I’m sure he’s going to be totally great, but they want ventilators, Italy wants ventilators, Spain wants ventilators, Germany wants ventilators, they’re all calling for ventilators. Well, we’re going to make a lot of ventilators and we’ll take care of our needs, but we’re also going to help other countries.  So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank our great American citizens and a lot of incredible things are happening, really happening, and it’s too bad … I was saying before we had the press conference when we signed, we had a signing ceremony where we signed the largest bill in our history. And I said, “Think of it, 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world. Everything was going beautifully. The stock market hit an all time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good. And then we got hit by the invisible enemy.” And now you have countries all over the world reeling. But we’re winning it and we’ll be a bigger and better and stronger than where we were even before. And we will also have apparatus in place that works. We won’t have broken systems, we’ll have incredible systems. So if this should happen again, hopefully it won’t. But if a thing like this should happen again, we’ll be able to handle it very much more easily. So with that I’ll take a few questions . Well, it got to be a debate about cost, and we don’t want to think too much about cost when we’re talking about this. This is not cost. I wasn’t happy where general motors built plants and other locations over the years, not so much during my term, but they built a lot of plants in other countries. I won’t name the countries, but you can imagine. And so I didn’t go into it with a very favorable view. I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, where they left Lordstown, Ohio in the middle of an auto boom because we had 17 car companies coming in and then they were leaving one plant in Ohio. I love Ohio.  And what happens? That became the story. Not that all these plants are moving in, but that you had a one plant, they were leaving. And frankly I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators. But we’ll see. We’ll see how that all works out. But so I wasn’t too thrilled. And then we thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden it became six and then price became a big object. But Peter Navarro’s going to handle that and Peter will do a very good job. We’ll see, maybe they’ll change their tune, but we didn’t want to play games with them. The quarantine orders. I think I’m going to let Tony speak to that a little bit later. But we’re being very strong on quarantine. We’re being very strong on people not leaving, especially certain states and going to other states where they have less of a problem. I mean, you’re hearing constantly about people leaving New York and going down to Florida, and New York obviously is a hot spot and that’s why we’re building all those hospitals in New York and all those medical centers in New York. So we’ll let Tony answer to that, but specifically you have to understand, we’re not playing games. John? It wasn’t after, it was before and we just were not getting there with General Motors. We weren’t getting there. We’re getting there with a lot of other companies and we have the people that are doing it for me in the room right here and we can talk to you later about it, but we have to get these people on board. We’re not looking to get into a big deal on price. We’re not looking to be ripped off on price. We don’t want prices to be double, triple what they should be. So General Motors, we’ll see what happens. But now they’re talking, but they weren’t talking the right way at the beginning and that was not right to the country. I think there’s a very good chance we won’t need that many. And I think frankly there’s a great chance that we’re not going to need that money. But you know what, there are a lot of other people that are going to need them. We have countries all over the world that are friends of ours and we will help those countries. We’re in a position to do things that other countries can’t. So we have a sort of an interesting position we can make them, because we’re going to be making over 100,000 pretty quickly. So we can make them. And if we don’t need them, John, that’s okay because we can help Italy and we can help UK, Boris Johnson specifically. I mean when I say, “How you feeling?” And the first thing Boris said to me is, “We need ventilators.” We’re not going to be keeping them. All over the world, they want them, and we’re in a position to make them and other countries aren’t. Okay? Well, if you look, and I think you can ask that question best of Deborah, but I think their estimates are high. I hope they’re high. They could be extremely high. We’re doing even hospitals based on pretty high estimates, I’m doing them anyway and as I told John, “If we do not need them, that’ll be wonderful. We can help a lot of great people all over the world. We can help them live.” But I think his estimates are going to be very high. We’re going to see. Don’t forget, we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know they got them. Then we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, they have a warehouse a New York, warehouse in Edison, New Jersey, which is an interesting thing. And we sent them to Edison, New Jersey. They were in the warehouse, ready to go, and New York never took them.  So they knew they were there. So we have to get people lined up, but we’ve given the … And I’m not blaming New York. Look, this is something that’s of a magnitude that nobody’s ever seen before. But I’ll tell you what, the federal government’s done a hell of a job. So we sent thousands of ventilators to New York and they didn’t know about it at the time they were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000 and then 2,000 and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers. And then before that we sent many thousands. We want to have so many-  And then before that we said many thousands. We want to have so many that we do have more than we need, because we can send them to other great countries, other countries that have been our friends and they’ll never be able to do it themselves. Yeah, please? Well, I think we’ve done a great job for the State of Washington and I think the governor, who is a failed presidential candidate as you know, he leveled out at zero in the polls, he’s constantly chirping, and I guess complaining would be a nice way of saying it. We’re building hospitals. We’ve done a great job for the State of Washington. Michigan, she has no idea what’s going on. And all she does is say, “Oh, it’s the federal government’s fault.” And we’ve taken such great care of Michigan. You know the care we’ve taken of New Jersey.  I think if you ask Governor Murphy of New Jersey, “How are we doing?” I think he’d say great. I think. He’s a Democrat. Governor Cuomo has really said we’re really doing a great job, and I saw the news conference where he was thanking the people from FEMA, the people from Army Corps of Engineers this morning. I mean, they built a hospital like in three and a half days, and it’s a big hospital in the Javits Center. And they’re building medical facilities in different parts of New York, and Governor Cuomo has been appreciative. But a couple of people aren’t. We have done a hell of a job. The federal government has really stepped up. All I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative. I don’t want them to say things that aren’t true. I want them to be appreciative. We’ve done a great job, and I’m not talking about me. I’m talking about Mike Pence, the Task Force, I’m talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers. There’s no country in the world could have done what the Army Corps of Engineers has done and is doing. Now they’re going in and building literal… They’re going into hotels and renovating hotels. That should be for governors to do. That should be for states to do.  We have the Army Corps of Engineers so teed up and so stocked up and they’re really psyched and they’re incredible, and there’s no games with these people. They’re in there screaming, “Get it done, get it done.” There’s not sitting around taking it easy. These are workers. These are incredible people. So I think the Army Corps of Engineers… When somebody for political reasons wants to blame, I view that as blaming these incredible people. Nobody’s ever seen it. I don’t know if you’ve been to the Javits Center. Now, I’ve seen it. I would love to go there, but with all that we’re doing, we will be tomorrow at the hospital. We have this incredible hospital boat. It was supposed to be ready in three and a half weeks, because it’s under maintenance, a big maintenance contract. We were able to get it done quickly. We were able to stock it up to the top and it’s leaving tomorrow at 2:00. It’s leaving Virginia. It’ll be in New York on Monday, weeks ahead of schedule. I think things, even the media, I think the media and governors should appreciate it.  And I have to say, the media has been pretty good and the governors have been really good, except for a couple. And with them, it’s just political. “How’s Trump doing?” “Oh, well, I don’t know.” Because we have done a job the likes of which nobody’s seen. I think they should be appreciative. Because you know what? When they’re not appreciative to me, they’re not appreciative to the Army Corps, they’re not appreciative to FEMA, it’s not right. These people are incredible. They’re working 24 hours a day. I mean, Mike Pence, I don’t think he sleeps anymore. These are people that should be appreciated. He calls all the governors. I tell him… I mean, I’m a different type of person. I say, “Mike, don’t call the Governor of Washington. You’re wasting your time with him. Don’t call the woman in Michigan.” It doesn’t make any difference what happens- You know what I say? If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call. He’s a different type of person. He’ll call quietly anyway, okay? But he’s done a great job. He should be appreciated for the job he’s done. Yes, ma’am? No, but I have spirit for the country. I mean, we have sailors, we have doctors on that ship. We have everything. I mean, I’m not going to be a jumping around in a huddle, but yeah, I think it’s a great sign, the President of the United States. They got a ship out of maintenance, completed all the work in a fraction of the time. It was supposed to be there for three and a half additional weeks and they got it done, and it’s in great shape and they’re sending it up.  So the answer… It’s a good question. It’s a fair question. I just feel that as the leader of our country, when they can do work like they’ve done, and they’ve been working all day, all night, medical supplies, everything loading up that ship, I don’t think it’s the worst thing in the world. It’s right down the road practically, right? Virginia. And I think it’s great if I go to Virginia. I guess I can take helicopter or plane. It’s a tiny trip. And I think it’s a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you. It doesn’t mean I’m going to be hugging people and it doesn’t mean that I’m going to be shaking people’s hands and everything, but I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, we’ll be careful. Peter? Yeah, I did. We did fill it twice. We filled it twice and we’ve been distributing that for literally a year. We’ve been filling it . That’s a nice question, Peter. Thank you very much. We’ve been filling it out and we’ve been filling that stockpile many, many times. It’s been filled many, many times. And now what we’re doing is something different, because I think it’s better. We’d fill it so it comes from wherever the point of manufacturer or whatever is, we fill it and then we go, “Now it’s full.” Now we take it and we distribute around. Now what we’re doing is, we have an emergency. We’re saying, “Go direct, go direct, go direct.” We fill it only where necessary, but now we’re trying to go direct.  So they drop it off in New York or they drop it off in Michigan. They drop it off in Virginia, wherever it may be, Florida. Florida is getting a lot of things. And we’re finding it’s a much better system, but we’ve filled and we’ve stockpiled many, many times. Yeah, we ended up with an empty shelf. Yes, please? So, I had a great conversation with the President of China last night, pretty late in the night. It was fascinating to me. They have a whole… It’s a different kind of a world. It’s a different form of government, to put it mildly. We talked for a long time. We talked for at least an hour, I guess. And one of the things I was asking him is, “When did you notice that this was happening?” We talked about the whole concept, how it happened, when it happened, what was the most effective use? I mean, was it the fact that distance… Was distance the best thing? We talked about everything.  And he’s gotten and developed… Because they’re ahead of us from the standpoint of time. It happened there actually long before it happened here. By the way, it would have happened here a lot sooner had we not kept those people out, the Chinese people coming over to the country, had we not kept them out. But we talked about it, because he’s had additional experience of having been much earlier. And he’s developed some incredible theories and all of that information is coming over here. A lot of it’s already come. The data, we call it data, and we’re going to learn a lot from what the Chinese went through.  Our relationship with China is very good. We also talked about the trade agreement, but I must tell you, this whole invisible enemy has taken over the world. Nobody cares about trade, nobody cares about anything. You want to talk about trade, they immediately get back to this. So we really did, we talked about trade. They’re starting to buy very heavily from the farmers under the agreement, under the trade deal that we just signed. But honestly, he, me, all of us, everybody’s talking. You turn on television, you read the papers, it’s all about this.  And you know what? It probably should be mostly about this. It’s hard to talk about, “Hey, how you doing with buying from the farmers?” They have started very, very large buying, as you probably have read. But what we really focused on was this- I also said, “How have you done with cures? And how have you done with respect to vaccines?” We discussed that. And they’re doing like we’re doing. They’re working on it very hard. They think they have some interesting things have been determined, and we’ll see what happens. But we talked a lot about vaccine. We talked a lot about possible cures. How good would that be? I mean, that’s a game changer. So, we’ll see.  And by the way, we have various things happening right now having to do with cures and vaccines. And I think we’re doing very well, especially in the vaccine thing. I think we’re very close. But as Tony will tell you, that’s a long testing process. So, we’ll see what happens. He never asked me to suspend tariffs, no. We’re taking in billions of dollars. He never did ask me that. John? So John, I’ll be sitting down with this brilliant woman and this brilliant man, and lots of brilliant people that work with them, I think. Right, Deborah and Tony? And we’ll be sitting down on Monday or maybe Tuesday, depending on which is the best for everybody, and we’ll be making that determination. Okay? We’ll be making it. And by the way, obviously we’re not doing it for New York. You see New York is just coming into this really heated situation. We’re building a lot of things in New York right now that nobody thought would ever be building. A lot of things are happening in New York, so obviously… But we are talking about possibly other parts of the country which really aren’t affected to any major degree. Or maybe we won’t do that, because maybe at the advice of a lot of very talented people that do this for a living, they won’t want to do that. They won’t want to expose anything. They want to do it all at one time. These are the kinds of things we’ll be talking about. Well, it depends. We do want to flatten the curve. We want to see that curve start heading down in the other direction at a minimum. And we really have to talk about areas of the country that have not been affected or certainly have had a very small affect. And we’ll see. I certainly want to get it open as soon as possible. I don’t want it to be long, but we also want it to open safe. Otherwise, what did we do? I hope not. I hope it’s going to be sooner. I hope it disappears faster than that. I really think that the people of our country have done a great job. Last night, I was watching and I’m looking down Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, John, there were no people in the street. I mean, normally you wouldn’t be able to see the sidewalk. There’d be cars all over, it’d be like rush hour stuff. I’m looking at it and I’m saying, “I can’t believe it. There are no cars, there are no people.” There wasn’t one person on Fifth Avenue walking down the street. I’ve never seen that before. I guess maybe at 1:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the morning maybe. But I’ve never seen that before. The people have been incredible.  When you talk about distancing, social distancing, I mean, we don’t have a law. We’re not going to put them in jail. And yet, they’re really… I think there’s two things. Number one, they are afraid. And number two, they really are wanting to win this thing. Yes, please? Sure. Sure. That’s a good question. We have brilliant people. We have a tremendous amount of money, and we have brilliant people that I’m taking from Wall Street with secretary Mnuchin, who’s done an incredible job, but brilliant guy, I’m taking from Wall Street people that I’ve known, that you all know, the top people in the world. They don’t want money. I mean, will they get something? I guess maybe they’ll get, who knows? Peanuts what they want compared to what they would normally get. I’m taking the smartest, the most brilliant people in the world in finance and they’re going to be dealing.  I’m not going to hire somebody that’s never done it, that’s a political person or anything else. We’re getting the most brilliant financial minds in the world. I know all of them, you know all of them. I mean, you read about all of them. I guess some you don’t read about, and they’re probably the smartest of them all. But the fact is, we’re taking these brilliant people and they’ll be dealing with United and they want to help.  Look, I’ll tell you right now, the airline business has always been a tough business. It’s always been a very tough business, tough to make money with. Every barrier you can have, that business has. But for our country, it’s very important. We have to take care of our country. We need the airlines to stay. It’s also big for jobs. So, we will be able to handle United and we’ll be able to handle Delta and we’ll be able to handle all of it. We have plenty of money.  Now, will we end up owning large chunks, depending on what these great geniuses decide along with the executives of the different companies? It’s possible, and they’ll make a better deal on the loan, but the taxpayer will then end up owning a big chunk of companies. As an example, Boeing. Boeing until a year ago was the greatest company, I think in the world by far. To me, there wasn’t anything close. I believe it was 1% of GDP. Okay? Think of that. One company, 1% of GDP. It was flawless. Then it had the problems and then it had on top of it, this whole thing with the virus. So Boeing will probably need a hand, and we’re going to bring Boeing back to health.  But we have the smartest people in the world. I don’t even know if you know that. I think this could be the first time you’ve heard it. People like Larry Fink we’re talking to, that’s BlackRock, and we have the smartest people and they all want to do it. I mean, this to them, they will… They love this country. They all want to do it. So, we’re speaking to people like that and they’ll be able to work it out. No, I think they’re the same thing. I mean, bringing people back to health and protecting people’s jobs. To me, and I’m okay at this stuff, that’s the same thing. I’m in a much different position as president than if I were an investor or something, but I want to bring them back to health, because I want to preserve their jobs. But I also want to preserve airlines, because that’s preserving lots of other jobs. That’s preserving the travel and leisure industry, which is perhaps the largest industry in our country if you add it all up. You add up all the hotels and all the traveling and all the planes and everything else, probably by far the largest industry in our country.  So saving the airlines is very important. And the airlines were all doing well. The airlines were doing record business a month before this today, let’s say. Even 22 days to be exact, right? When we first started seeing some real signs of problems, they were at record levels. Last year they had a record year. The biggest in the history of the airlines. Everybody was doing well. I mean, I was presiding over the most successful economy in the history of the world. And now we’re going to have to rebuild it, and I think we’re going to have an absolute incredible fourth quarter. And maybe it’s slightly after that to be honest, but it’s going to be in that time period. As soon as we get rid of this, I think we’re going to have an explosion upward. It’s going to be incredible. Please? That’s true. I do, because he’s a very talented guy. He’s a very good governor. Everyone loves him. He’s doing a fantastic job for Florida. He was not happy with the people coming down from New York. They’re flying down from New York, and he had a state and has a state, with obviously a lot less problems. Florida has been doing really well in the sense of testing. The testing has shown much better results. Maybe they’ll talk to you about that later.  But no, he was very unhappy with the people coming down from New York, and I understand that. No, Ron’s a very tough guy. He’s a great governor and I have tremendous confidence in him. And he had the beach situation. He resolved that. He will get it all resolved. Yeah, please? You have to go louder. You’re going to have to speak louder. We have some very, very strong restrictions. But you’re right, I don’t like it. So, we’re seeing how it works. The data is coming in on Monday and Tuesday, and we’re going to see how it looks. But can we go to a tougher level? We can, but that causes other problems. We’re going to see, and we’ll be reporting back very shortly after my meetings with Tony, Deborah, and others that we’re going to be meeting with, and our vice president. And we’re going to be reporting back to the media. Okay? Please, corner? Yes. I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we were attacked like nothing that’s happened possibly since 1917, many, many years ago. We were attacked, and we’re winning the battle and we’re going to win, and it’s not going to take hopefully that much longer, but we have to win the war. And I would say that they have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad. They look like they’re lucky to have you as a father. And just learn from it.  But the young people have been tremendous. Some of them are very happy not to go to school. You understand that. Perhaps yours, perhaps not. We have literally had no problem. But again, they should just sit back and be very proud of our country, because we’re doing it for them. Ultimately, we’re doing it for them more than anything else if you think about it.  The other thing that’s nice and the one thing that has come out, and I learned this, again it was reaffirmed by president Xi last night in my conversation, the young people are really, this is an incredible phenomenon, but they are attacked, successfully attacked to a much lesser extent by this pandemic, by this disease, this whatever they want to call it. You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you can call it many different names. I’m not sure anybody even knows what it is, but the children do very well. It’s almost the younger they are, the better they do. I guess the immune system is… Sadly, for some of us, their immune system is stronger. But actually, I’m very happy about that.  But they have been attacked. For instance, the Spanish flu, and if you look at the H1N1, if you take a look at the swine flu, which was as you know not so long ago, that attacked very young children, kids, middle age people, everyone. Age is a factor here, so your children should be in good shape, but just tell them to be very proud of the country. Okay? Well, we’re going to make that determination. And you’re going to have something to do with that. I mean, look, we’re going to be guided also. You have some real strong feelings, the media. I’ll tell you what, the media generally… I mean, I’m impressed. A lot of the media has been fair. I’m not used to fair treatment in the media. I don’t know how to handle it, but overall I think the media has been pretty fair. Some not. I mean, I could tell you who, but what’s the point? But the media has really been fair. I mean, they view this as we’re all in a problem together and we’re going to win. We’re going to win. Please? Well, that’s not happening. I mean, I think they wrote us out and that’s all right. But that’s not happening. As far as the Mayor of New York, I’ll be honest, I didn’t know him well. He and I are obviously opposite persuasion and we would go at it, but we didn’t… I don’t know if we ever spoke to other than to maybe say hello a couple of times. I did down at the World Trade Center Memorial once a long time ago.  So, I’ve spoken to him a lot, Mayor de Blasio, and we’ve really had incredibly productive discussions. I’ve gotten him a lot of people. We’ve gotten him a medical center he’s asked for at Elmhurst. I know Elmhurst Hospital very well. I mean, that was an area of Queens that I grew up in. And boy, you talk about an epicenter. That’s really the epicenter of the epicenter. That’s really something. We talked about it, because that was very close to where I grew up. And knowing it, being so familiar with it, it’s incredible to see where they have the trucks. I don’t have to go into great detail. The refrigerated trucks coming up, and I’ve never seen anything like it.  I’ve spoken with Mayor de Blasio a lot in the last week. We’ve helped him, I think a lot, and I’ve really gotten to like him. I get along with him very well. Now, he wants us to do certain things and we’ve produced. I mean, today I spoke to him with the Secretary of Defense Esper, and we had a great conversation and we’re helping him get some of the things he needs. I don’t have to go into great detail, but he’s very happy about what we’re able to do for him today. And he’s like us. He’s working very hard. But I can’t say anything bad about Mayor de Blasio. I mean, my relationship with him over the last couple of weeks has been excellent and we’ve done a good job for him too. Yeah, please? So, we’re doing that. Great question. We’re increasing capacities- Right. We’re actually adding on through the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a big job and we’re doing it in many states, not just New York and California. By the way, Gavin Newsom’s been terrific. I have to tell you, the Governor of California, we’re getting along really well. We’re working hard for him. As you know, the other hospital ship, and they are incredible. That just arrived in Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been-  In Los Angeles, fully stocked. But Gavin Newsom has been really good, and so many of the governors have been good, and these are governors that I’ve been fighting with about different things for a long time. The forest fires in his case, and the border, and all sorts of things. And here we are getting along very well. And I appreciate his nice words. I really do. I really appreciate it. And the people with me appreciate it. Do you have another question? Yeah. Good question. I mean, look, we just started this, we were just notified. And some of the governors have asked us to build hospitals through extensions, through portable hospitals, through things. And normally, in all fairness, this is done normally through local government. We don’t go into cities and expand a hospital that’s existing, but we’re doing it now, because we really are equipped to do it. We have incredible people, and where expanding hospitals, we’re building many portable hospitals. Not only Javits Center, where you have four, plus you have four medical centers, but we’re doing it in New Jersey. Governor Murphy. We’re doing it in other states. We’re doing it in California. We’re doing some in the state of Washington, despite the fact that I’m not appreciative of the way the governor speaks. We’re doing it in a lot of different locations, and we’re doing a lot of expansions. We’re also taking over buildings, and the city will go in, or the state usually will go in, take over a building, and we go in and equip it and make it so that it’s now hospital functioning. They call it hospital functioning. We’re doing a lot of that. Again, this is normally done by governors, and then give it to the city to do it. You know, you bring it into the point, but we’re doing a lot of that, and they’re doing a great job, mostly done by the Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA. That I don’t know. Yeah. Well they say I had classified briefings a long time ago, which wasn’t true. But we’ve had briefings, and as I know it, the governors have also had many briefings by- I think we knew for a while, but if you take a look, I was the first one to say to China, and I have great respect for China, I will tell you that. But I was the first one when they had the problem, to say you can’t come in. And if you go back, that’s a long time ago. Jon, please? Here’s what we’re going to have. Are you ready? We’re going to have more than, we’re manufacturing a lot of them now, we’re accumulating a lot. We’re taking a lot, through the act, we’re taking a lot. We’re actually taking them. And we’re going to have in a very short period of time, and Peter’s doing it along with some very talented people, some really talented people. It’s very impressive actually, but we’re actually taking a lot. We’re going to have plenty. And if for some reason, Jon, if for some reason you’re going to need even more, we’re going to be prepared.  As an example, we’ve given out thousands and thousands, which I think you’ll know. We accumulated thousands. We give them out. But we right now, I think in the stockpile, we have over 10,000. The reason we don’t want to distribute that is for exactly what you’re saying. If there’s a mad rush in New York, or maybe in Louisiana, or maybe someplace else, we don’t want to have given out all of those units, the ventilators, and then in those sections we give them to Iowa, but they didn’t have a problem in Iowa. We give them to Idaho. We give them to lots of different places, and now we have to try and get them back, which is never easy to do. No Jon, what I’m saying is this, we are prepared for things that nobody has any idea that we’d be prepared. And you know what? When I took this over, it was an empty box. We didn’t have testing, we didn’t have anything. We had a broken system there. We had a broken system with stockpiling, we had a lot of broken systems. And I’m not just blaming President Obama, you go long before that, but in all fairness, all of the former presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen. But we have right now, 10,000 ventilators in stockpile. We are ready to go with those ventilators.  What we don’t want is where we distribute the ventilators like we did in New York, and they didn’t need them, or they didn’t know, or they didn’t use them. If we need them in New York, we’re going to have plenty. Now, we’re getting a lot of ventilators in the next short period of time. A lot of ventilators are coming in the next short period of time. We’re manufacturing. We went to all of the companies, I read their names, we went to all of those companies. They are going to go, I would say ’round the clock, Peter, is that right? They’re going round the clock. Let’s put it this way. Let’s put it this way. We’ve distributed thousands and thousands already. Normally these would be bought by states, just so you understand. Normally these would be bought by governors. They were… I don’t want to say unprepared, but nobody was prepared for this. What we’ve done, nobody can even imagine. And by the way I’ve had governors tell me, including Democrat governors, they said, “We can’t believe you’ve been able to do this.” And you go to other countries, and we’re not only competing against states, because we don’t want to compete against states. We’ve had a couple of cases where states were buying, we were buying, and I said specifically, because I heard about it. Pull back. Let the state buy it. Immediately, the price goes way down, and they end up buying it. But we’re also competing against many countries, because many countries need the ventilators. That’s why I want to build more if possible. Jon, maybe we’ll take one more question. So here’s what I’ll tell you. I think we’re in really good shape. This is a pandemic, the likes of which nobody’s seen before. I think we’re in great shape. I think that number one, we’ve distributed… ventilators are a big deal. We’ve distributed vast numbers of ventilators, and we’re prepared to do vast numbers. I think we’re in great shape. I hope that’s the case. I hope that we’re going to have leftovers, so we can help other people, other countries. Look, look. Don’t be a cutie pie. Okay? Everyone who needs one. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Nobody’s done anything like we’ve been able to do. And everything I took over was a mess. It was a broken country in so many ways, in so many ways other than this. We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system, we had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn’t tell me what you’re, you know, like being a wise guy. Go ahead. There may be something where we’re going to have to help states, because the states have been hurt very badly. And the beautiful thing about our country is, 6.2 trillion, because it is 2.2 plus four, it’s 6.2 trillion dollars, and we can handle that easily, because of who we are, what we are. It’s our money, it’s our… we are the ones. It’s our currency. We can handle it, and we can handle… I watched Jerome Powell the other day, and he did a good job. He said, we’ll do whatever we have to do. Jon, we have to do whatever we have to do. The priority is life, and safety, and then the economy. Life, and safety. We’ll see. No, no, no, we’ll see. A lot of things can- I tell them, if it’s your life, then it’s your safety, and if we need more time, they’re not going to have a problem waiting it out. It’s life, it’s safety, and it’s our country, but we have to take care of people. At the same time, we want to get them out. They want to get out. Our country was built on that, but we have to make sure it’s safe, and everyone knows that. Okay. One more question, please. So Hydroxychloroquine, which is supposed to be the better of the two seems to have some good backing. We’re going to see. Look, Governor Cuomo, we’ve given him 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And they’re testing it. It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for arthritis, and it’s phenomenal for those two things, as you probably know, especially for malaria. But we’re going to find out soon. I hope it works. There are signs that it could be doing well, they are testing 10,000 units. It’s a lot. And I tell you what, I want to thank the FDA, because they approved it immediately, based on the fact that it was already out for a different purpose. They approved it immediately. So look, Hydroxychloroquine is a very powerful drug for certain things. And it’s a very successful drug. There’s reason to believe that it could be successful here. Now, the reason I disagree with you, and I think Tony would disagree with me, but the reason I disagree with you is that we have a pandemic.  We have people dying now. If we’re going to go into labs and test all of this for a long time, we can test it on people right now, who are in serious trouble, who are dying. If it works, we’ve done a great thing. If it doesn’t work, we tried. But this is not something that’s going to kill people. So we can go in, and we can test, and we can take our time. When I was with the FDA, they indicated that, “Well, we’ll start working on it right away, and it could take a year.” I said, “What do you mean a year? We have to have it tonight. If we don’t have it tonight, I want to test it immediately. Because it’s on the market in a different form.” So we know that. So from a safety standpoint, at least we know that, but you’re talking about giving it to people, who in many cases are dying. So we want to do it the way… this is sort of like Right-To-Try. We got Right-To-Try approved. Jon, for 44 years or more, they couldn’t get it approved. We have the best labs, the best doctors. They couldn’t get it… I got it approved. Now, if somebody’s terminally I’ll, and if we think we have something that’s going to work, we can actually use it. They can use it, and I’ll tell you what you ought to do when this is over. You’ve got to do a story on that, because we have had some tremendous results. It’s not even talked to me about, just more fake news Jon. Look, not even talked to me. They’re talking about… the only one I’ve heard that from, like as an example, China pays 25% interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in. That’s a lot. Everybody keeps saying, “Oh, are you going to suspend the tariffs?” Well, the answer’s no, but President Xi never even brought it up last night, it wasn’t even discussed. It’s fake news. Tell the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street Journal does a lot of fake news too. It’s pretty amazing.  So I want to leave you by just saying, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank the American public, and all of the people that have helped so much, and we’re going to give the podium to vice president Pence, who has been incredible, and if he’s tired, and if he’s not answering questions like he should, we have a great reason, because he hasn’t slept in about four weeks. But I want to thank him, because he has dedicated, I mean he is a dedicated person long before this, but the job he’s done has been fantastic. So I want to thank Mike, all the people on the task force, and FEMA, and Army Corps, everybody. You’ve been fantastic. Thank you all very much."
"Well, thank you all very much. It’s a very important day. I will sign the single biggest economic relief package in American history, and I must say, or any other package, by the way. It’s twice as large as any relief ever signed. It’s a 2.2 billion, but it actually goes up to 6.2 potentially billion dollars, trillion dollars. So you’re talking about a $6.2 trillion bill, nothing like that. And this will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation’s families, workers and businesses. And that’s what this is all about. And they’d got a 96 to nothing. And I don’t know what was the number in Congress?  Was fantastic. That’s pretty amazing. That’s about the same thing, right Kevin? So that’s fantastic. But I want to thank Republicans and Democrats for coming together, setting aside their differences and putting America first. This legislation provides for direct payments to individuals and unprecedented support to small businesses. We’re going to keep our small businesses strong and our big businesses strong, and that’s keeping our country strong and our jobs string. This historic bill includes the following:  $300 billion in direct cash payments will be available to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year. $3,400 for a typical family of four. So family of four $3,400. And then $350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers. The workers get paid. Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. So things like this have never happened in our country. $500 billion in support for hard-hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks. We don’t let them buy back the stock. We don’t let that happen. And tough limits on executive compensation over $100 billion to support our heroic doctors, nurses, and hospitals.  And you see what’s happening. And I want to thank, while we’re here also the incredible job that’s done by the Army Corps of Engineers and by FEMA. It’s been incredible. They did four hospitals in two days or three days in New York and they’re like incredible structures. What a job they’ve been doing and they’re doing them all over the country. $45 billion for the disaster relief fund supporting our state, local and tribal leaders. $27 billion for the development of vaccines, therapies and other public health response efforts, including $16 billion to build up the strategic national stockpile with critical stockpiles. And I’m going to, we have a tremendous supplies coming into the stockpile and you’ll be seeing that and hearing about it a little bit because we’re doing a news conference at 5:30 on what’s happening. We’ve had tremendous results on the respirators. We’ve had great results on just about everything we’re talking about.  Boeing just announced that they’re going to be making the plastic face shields, the actual shields, which are hard to come by and they’re going to be making them by the thousands a week. And the ventilators, which is probably the most difficult because it’s like building a car. We will be announcing thousands are going to be built and we have a month of contract and we have fast deliveries. As you know, we delivered thousands to New York and unfortunately they were delivered to a warehouse, which was good. Unfortunately they didn’t take them, but now they’re taking them. New York is now taking them and redistributing around the areas that they need. So you have also $3.5 billion to states to expand childcare benefits for healthcare workers, first responders and others on the front lines of this crisis and $1 billion for securing supplies under the defense protection act.  And as you know, I’ve enacted the act and we’ve used it three or four times. I pulled it back three times because the companies came through in the end, they didn’t need the act. It’s been great leverage. I have instituted that against General Electric. We thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and all of a sudden the 40,000 came down to 6,000 and then they talked about a higher price than we were discussing. So I didn’t like it. So we did activate it with respect to General Motors and hopefully maybe we won’t even need the full activation. We’ll find out, but we need the ventilators. I said, hello today. I called him a wonderful guy, Boris Johnson, as you know, he tested positive and before he even said hello, he said, we need ventilators. I said, wow, that’s a big statement and hopefully he’s going to be in good shape.  I just spoke to Angela Merkel and she’s quarantined also. She is right now for a period of two weeks being forced to stay in her house. So this is just an incredible situation. Last night, I spoke to President Xi, we talked about the experience that they had in China and all of the things that have taken place and we learned a lot. They’ve had a very tough experience and they’re doing well and he’s doing well. President Xi is doing very well but we learned a lot and we have great communication together. We’re going to be sending great data from China, things have happened that they see that they’ve had an early experience and we’re getting all of that information. Much of it was sent yesterday and sent to our scientists to study. So we’ll have more on that also.  We’ll be discussing that at 5:30 I just want to thank the people behind me. They’ve been incredible friends. They’ve been warriors. There’s nobody tougher or smarter than the people standing alongside of me. And I think I want to start off by asking Mitch and then Kevin to speak and then we’re going to go through a few of the folks in the room if they’d like to say something. But Mitch, I’d love you to say a few words because this man worked 24 hours a day for a long time. This is the result. It’s the biggest ever, ever approved in Congress. $6.2 trillion. So, we used to get used to the billion. It used to be million than it was billion. Now it’s trillion and it’s going to go a long way. It’s going to make a lot of people very happy. Mitch McConnell, please."
"Thank you very much, Mark. Thank you very much, Mark, and you’re doing a fantastic job. Our country appreciates it very much.  Thank you everybody for being here today. I’m deeply honored to be at Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval base anywhere in the world and the home to the most powerful fleet that has ever sailed the seas. I just passed some of the most beautiful and, frankly, the most highly-lethal ships that I have ever seen in my life, and there are a lot of them, and they’re in better shape now than they have been for many, many decades with what we’re doing.  We’re grateful to be joined by Commander of the US Fleet Forces, Admiral Christopher Grady, and Commander of the US 2nd Fleet, Vice Admiral Woody Lewis. Thank you both for being here. We appreciate it very much.  As we gather today, our country is at war with an invisible enemy. We are marshaling the full power of the American nation, economic, scientific, medical, and military to vanquish the virus, and we will do that.  Today, I’m here to express my profound gratitude to the dedicated service members who will soon be on the front lines of this fight. In a few moments, the crew of the Navy Hospital Ship USNS Comfort, which is really something, will embark for New York City, where they will join the ranks of tens of thousands of amazing doctors, nurses, and medical professionals who are battling to save American lives.  This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York, a place I know very well, a place I love. We’re here for you, we fighting for you, and we are with you all the way, and we always will be. You have the unwavering support of the entire nation, the entire government, and the entire American people.  After being rushed out of maintenance with historic speed, it was supposed to be here for four weeks, and they did it in four days, the Comfort will arrive at Pier 90 in Manhattan on Monday, three weeks ahead of schedule. Its crew will begin treating patients on Tuesday. It will be met in New York Harbor by Governor Cuomo, who I just spoke with. He’s very excited, and they need the help.  The skilled sailors and civilian mariners aboard this ship will provide a critical surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area. Their mission will be to care for New Yorkers who do not have the virus but who require urgent care. In other words, they’ll be using this. People will be coming out of hospitals who don’t have the virus, and they’ll be on the ship where they have great operating rooms and great facilities. The places inbound, on land, will be where people that have the virus will be. So the people with the virus will not be on ship. The ship will be used for people having operations and other things other than that. By serving these emergency patients away from the hospitals, beds will be opened up all over the city for those who are infected.  This ship can handle a lot of people, so it will open capacity all over the city, and it’ll be ready to address any life-threatening medical emergency. It is stocked, it’s stocked to the brim with equipment and medicines and everything you can think of. Importantly, by treating noninfected patients remotely on the ship, it will help to halt very strongly the transmission of the virus.  The Comfort’s sister ship on the West Coast, the USNS Mercy, arrived ahead of schedule substantially in port yesterday. Governor Gavin Newsom was very thankful for it. They’re working very hard in California. It’s performing a similar mission for the people of Los Angeles and the people of California.  As the USNS Comfort gets underway, it is fully loaded with 12 operating rooms and they are fully equipped, 1000 hospital beds, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, digital radiology, a CT scan, two oxygen-producing plants, and a helicopter deck, which will be used very actively. It also bears our military’s greatest weapon of all, a crew of nearly 1,200 outstanding members of the United States Navy, and I thank them very much.  Among the sailors departing today are some of the finest doctors, nurses, technicians, orderlies, and medical staff anywhere in the world. These are true professionals, and no one performs better under pressure when lives are on the line. These are incredible people.  We will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers and the health of the people of our country in their hour of need.  I also want to remind everyone about the CDC’s latest guidance. If you are from the New York metropolitan area and you travel elsewhere, we need you to self-quarantine for 14 days to help us contain the spread of the virus. I am now considering and will make a decision very quickly, very shortly, a quarantine. Because it’s such a hot area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, we’ll be announcing that one way or the other fairly soon. This does not apply to people, such as truckers from outside the New York area who are making deliveries or simply transiting through. It won’t affect trade in any way.  The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA are racing to build temporary hospitals which are now completed, by the way, in record time. Four hospitals, four medical centers. In speaking with the Governor this morning, we’re giving them an additional four large tents which they need very badly. The emergency medical stations in New York are top of the line. You have them in not only New York, but in California and Illinois. We’ll be adding some to other states also.  I’ve empowered our nation’s governors with the resources to call up the National Guard and authorized the activation of ready reserves. Two big words, ready reserves. FEMA has shipped or delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.2 million face shields, and a lot are being made of all of the things I just named right now. We have millions and millions of new medical items being made as we speak, and purchased. 4.3 million surgical gowns, 22 million gloves, and 8,100 ventilators. We have moved rapidly to mobilize every instrument of American power.  This week, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to carry out federal contracts for ventilators, and I think they’re going to do a great job. I have to say that. We’re also working with the major ventilator companies in the United States. All big name companies, all companies that do ventilators, so they won’t need extra time. They’re gearing up, and they’ll be working 24 hours around the clock, and they have been, they’ve been doing a fantastic job, to accomplish a historic ramp-up and a ramp-up in the kind of numbers that we’re talking about.  If we make too many, that’s going to be okay, because I spoke with the Prime Minister of the UK yesterday, Boris Johnson. He tested, as you know, positive. Before I even was able to get a word out of him, he said … I said, “How you doing?” He said, “We need ventilators.” The UK needs ventilators. A lot of countries need ventilators badly. It’s a tough thing to make. It’s a very complicated and expensive piece of equipment. I would say more so than a car. You’re talking about expensive, complicated equipment. So I hope we soon will have enough that we can help other countries with ventilators. A lot of countries need them.  In the next 100 days, America will make or acquire three times more ventilators than we do in an entire year, we are so geared up. At Boeing, Ford, Honeywell, 3M, , and other great American companies, factory floors and manufacturing lines are being converted to produce the respirators, protective masks, face shields, and other vital equipment. Those companies have been amazing. Boeing is giving us their cargo-moving planes. They’re the biggest cargo movers anywhere in the world, and we’re going to be using them to ship certain types of equipment to various states.  Hundreds of millions of Americans are also making tremendous sacrifices on the home front in a historic drive to support our great workers and businesses. I signed into law the single largest economic relief package in American history. You saw that yesterday. The $2.2 trillion, and think of that $2.2 trillion, but it goes to $6.2 trillion depending on what we decide. This legislation delivers job retention loans for small businesses to help them keep workers on payroll, expanded unemployment benefits, and direct cash payments to American citizens. These are very substantial payments. A family of four will be getting approximately $3,400.  This legislation also provides massive increases in funding for hospitals who need it for disaster relief fund and critical lifesaving medical supplies. We’re spending a tremendous amount of money on medical supplies. We’re trying to get it to the point needed directly, as opposed to our supply lines, so it can go directly to where they need it without having to go through a long process. I don’t want to say bureaucratic, but we have not … This group of people has worked so incredibly hard, and the energy and the speed with which they’re delivering everything has been really admired by everybody. Everybody’s talking about it, the job they’re doing.  My administration has also taken action to dispend and suspend federal student loan payments, so we’re suspending, and that means suspending in every sense of the word, student loan payments so that the students that are not able to take advantage of what’s going on, obviously for obvious reasons, they will be, the payments suspended.  We’ve temporarily stopped federal evictions and foreclosures. We’ve postponed tax day until July, which is a big thing, first time that’s happened, and waved regulations to speed new treatments to the market. We have new treatments coming on rapidly. We’re doing very well, we think, with vaccines, and we’re doing very, very well with, hopefully or potentially, cures. We’re looking at a lot of different alternatives, a lot of different medicines that would be game changer.  The battle in which we’re now engaged has inflicted many hardships on our nation and our families, tremendous hardship on some families, and much death, much death. But through it all, the world has witnessed the unyielding resolve of our incredible American people. We are not only a country of vast resources, we’re a nation of colossal strength, towering spirit, soaring patriotism, and exceptional character, and you’re showing it to the entire world.  At this moment, there are 151 countries throughout the world that are under attack by this horrible, invisible enemy. 151 countries, and we’re in touch with a lot of them. Our professionals are the best in the world. But who would ever think 151 countries are under attack?  We are one family bound together by love and loyalty, the eternal traits so perfectly embodied by the extraordinary men and women aboard this ship, and the men and women at this beautiful, scenic, but really tough base. This base is something. Thank you very much. This base is something very, very special.  With the courage of our doctors and nurses, with the skill of our scientists and innovators, with the determination of the American people, and with the grace of God, we will win this war, and we will win this war quickly with as little death as possible.  When we achieve our victory, this victory, your victory, we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. We are going to be at a level of preparedness in case something like this should ever happen again. And God willing, it won’t. But we are prepared. What we’ve done in building systems, we’re now the number one tester anywhere in the world by far. We’re testing more in one day than other countries are testing in weeks and months.  We’ve learned a lot, and I cannot be more thankful to the American people. I can say this, and I can say this from the bottom of my heart, I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much, and God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the rose garden. Tremendous distance between chairs, social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That’s great. I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus. On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightening fast results in as little as five minutes, and it’s a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they’ve done. They’ve been working around the clock. Normally this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day starting this weekend. As you know, even before this development, we’ve been doing more tests than any other country anywhere in the world.  It’s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we’ve been testing. It’s also one of the reasons that we’re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we’ve been doing more testing so we have bigger numbers to look at. I want to also thank General Seminite out of the Army Corps of Engineers and general Paul Acheck who’s here with us, who’s going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did along with FEMA in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds worth of hospital, an incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well, and I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days. People have never seen anything like that, and it’s an incredible, complex, top of the line hospital. They did it so quickly.  Everyone’s trying to figure out how they did it, including me and I was a good builder, but they did it very quickly, Mike. So we’re very, we’re very happy. So I want to thank army Corps of engineers, FEMA, the incredible job they have done now they’re moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals. We’re doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey, many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women and they worked around the clock and the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate, but these are … I mean, nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it. The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contained, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus. It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus, so important in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes.  We will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers in making. I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients, people in New York along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin, and it’s very early yet. It’s only … It started two days ago, but we will see what happens. I want to thank Steven Hahn, who’s a great doctor. Left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible hospital in Texas, and he’s the head of the FDA and Steven got approval for that so fast. Let’s see how it works. It may, it may not, but we may have some incredible results. We’re going to know soon. So it’s tested … It’s being tested on 1,100 people in New York. The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients.  This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus, so they’re recovered, they’re strong, something was good in them that worked, and so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well, meaning their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus and transfusing it into sick patients, very, very, very powerfully. So sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system. We’ll see what happens and we’re having some early results that are good, but we will see, and that’s going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in really very quick time. We’re also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself … I’ve seen some of the masks are very complex. We’re delivering millions by the way, millions, but I kept saying, “Why aren’t they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?”  Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio called me, they have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks and in some cases, depending on the mask, some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material. They’re able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that’s, I guess, like getting 20 masks. And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved and the FDA is now involved and we’re trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. It would be really helpful. While much of the research has to be done, we have a lot of research left to do obviously, this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries. We’re in communication with other countries, very strong communications and they’re very reliant on us in just about all cases.  We have the greatest people in the world. They’re very, very anxious to find out how we’re doing on our different things, whether it’s a cure or whether it’s really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced I think over the next few weeks, but we’ll see what happens. They’re being tested right now. The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I’d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick, and we’re working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don’t stop. This method also has been used for more than a century, and that’s the blood-related therapy. More than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it’s not unusual.  Our level of complexity has changed, but it’s a concept that’s been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic, and that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody’s seen until what we’re facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was, probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed and also other viruses like the one in this outbreak. This is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spread so quickly, like nothing we’ve seen. It spread so easily, so quickly. We’re unleashing every tool in our nation’s vast arsenal, economic, if you look, medical and scientific, military. Homeland Security is a working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus. As you know, every level of government, state, local and federal is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers, we’re delivering vast orders of this material. I’m going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it.  Joining us today are the leaders of America’s largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment including McKesson, Cardinal health, Henry Schein, Owens and Minor, Medline, FedEx and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed. And maybe I’d like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Coffman to come up and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen and Minor, but I and I appreciate it and if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up Mike for a second and Ed for a second, just you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I bring that up because when we discussed back in a room, we were in a conference room. Very nice one, actually. It’s called the cabinet room. That statement was made that they’ve been delivering for years, 10 to 20,000 masks. Okay. It’s a New York hospital. It’s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 to 300,000? 10 to 20,000 masks, to 300,000. even though this is different, something’s going on. And you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that’s possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places. Not to that extent. That was the highest number I’ve heard. That’s the highest number you’ve seen, I would imagine. Right? But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals.  He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn’t get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York. FEMA is working with these companies to launch Project Airbridge to expedite the movement of critical supplies from other countries to the United States. The first flight arrived at JFK Airport, New York this morning, filled with 80 tons of personal protective equipment including 130,000 N95 respirators. Those are the ones that we were talking about before. 1.8 million face masks and gowns, 10.3 million gloves and many other things, millions and millions of different items. FEMA has scheduled 19 additional flights and is adding more daily. We hope to have about 50 flights. We’re going to have, I think including the one that came in today, we’re up at 51 flights with these massive planes from the different companies that was so nice to be here today. Would you like to say something on behalf? Please come up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great job you’re doing. Please. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Fantastic job. Anybody else if you want? Yes please. You did such a great job. . Thank you. So thank you all very much and for the great job you’re doing. It’s really incredible, frankly. Many of the States are stocked up. Some of them don’t admit it, but we have sent just so much, so many things to them and including ventilators. There’s a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains as we call them, they are holding ventilators. They don’t want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there’s big problems. We can’t hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road. So we’ve delivered a lot in this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you, and UPS and FedEx in particular. You’ve gone absolutely out of your way. So we appreciate everything you’ve done and delivered. The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives.  Yesterday I visited naval station Norfolk as the USNS comfort departed for New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy, anywhere, frankly, in the United States. It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early. It was under a maintenance and they got the maintenance done very quickly. They worked around the clock as many of the people have and it was a great site. Additionally, two of the country’s largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna are announcing that they will waive copays, which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance. They don’t waive copays too easily, but we’ve asked them to do it and they’ve done it. Coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic, so they’re waiving copays, coinsurance, and deductibles.  Nobody’s … I don’t think anyone’s heard of that one. Have you heard of that one before? I haven’t heard. I want to thank them. Great companies. Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang Puck is a great restaurateur as you know, as is John George and Thomas Keller and Daniel Ballou and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest hit industries. I have directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs, incentives to stay open. You’re going to lose all these restaurants and they’re not going to make it back and they have to get going. So what I’m doing is I’m going to tell Secretary Mnuchen and also our great secretary of labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago.  We’re going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it’ll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open. And I mean, don’t forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not too distant future and we expect that, but there are some that aren’t going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do. So we’re going to look at the restoration, restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so the corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days. That was when restaurants were doing really well. The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historical relief for American workers and small businesses and includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that’s a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the work.  – With loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers, so it’s $350 billion job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers. I mean, how about that? $300 billion in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year, $3400 for the typical family of four, so they’ll be getting a check for $3400 for the typical family of four. Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems. Not us, state.  I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they’re not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly. They’re not set up for that, and I didn’t want to do it, but our opponents wanted it, so we did it, and if they don’t get their money fast, I’m going to ask that we convene the federal government, that we come back to Congress and we’ll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly, and I said that, but a lot of these systems are so old and so antiquated at the state level that they’re going, they have the money, they’re going to get the money very quickly, but they’re not going to be able to distribute it, so remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money.  Throughout this great national struggle the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge, every single one, in our nation’s history. More than 90% of Americans say they are staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens, and to their country. Social distancing, that’s the way you win. These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before. Family bonds are strengthening, neighbors are looking after neighbors, it’s incredible. I’m seeing, you’re seeing, everybody’s seeing what’s happening. Communities are rallying for the cause, and old divisions are fading away. The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need.  It’s up to 151 countries, so when we say our nation, our nation and the world, when you think. Think of it, 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn’t in this particular world, they didn’t know that we had that many countries. 151 countries, that’s something. Some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible. If you look at Italy, if you look at, France is having big problems, Spain is having incredible problems. Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do. Great thing to do. We would have thousands and thousands of more deaths, and we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level, but those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that.  The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare exp-, I mean, we have, and these people are amazing, the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world, they demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and ultimately the number of fatalities. I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You’re making the difference. The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks, so I’ll say it again: the peak, the highest point of death rates, remember this, is likely to hit in two weeks. Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all. Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period it’s very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines, have to follow the guidelines that our great vice president holds up a lot. He’s holding that up a lot. He believes in it so strongly.  The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end. Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread. On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people. So we’ll be having lots of meetings in between, but we’ll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday, probably Tuesday evening, on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we’re doing things the way we’re doing them. We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening.  I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease. We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic. With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion. We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage. We will win, and when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed. We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has, and the world, again.  In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse, this invisible enemy, and rise to incredible new heights. So I just want to thank you all for being here, and we’ll take some questions if you’d like, yeah. Please. Kelly. No, I want the people in New York to check Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, that when a hospital that’s getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period, and that’s a rapid period, I would like them to check that, because I hear stories like that all the time. We’re delivering millions and millions of different products, and all we do is hear, “Can you get some more?” But when you hear that, and I heard that from one of the great companies of the world, that doing this, it’s a client, and they’re going from, you heard it, 10,000, 20,000 tops, to 300,000, and that’s a hospital that’s always full, so I think people should check that, because there’s something going on. I don’t think it’s hoarding, I think it’s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. I don’t know. I don’t know. I think that’s for other people to figure out, but you don’t go from numbers like that. Now, other equipment likewise, because we’re delivering a lot of ventilators, and we’re building, by the way, we’re building and buying. We have a lot of ventilators that we’re going to be sending out very soon. We also have, right now, in the stockpile, almost 10,000 ventilators that we have to hold in case of emergency. We don’t want them going out and then Louisiana has a tremendous problem, which we now know they do. All of a sudden it came, very quickly. Louisiana was doing so fantastically well, then all of a sudden there was a big rash of cases, so we have to be prepared to move the ventilators. They’re very important pieces of equipment. They’re very expensive, and they’re very complex. It’s like building a car. These are expensive, complicated, very complicated pieces of equipment.  So we now have 10,000, and we inherited a system which was broken, just like, I’ll never forget the day when a general came and said, “Sir,” my first week in office, “We have no ammunition.” That was in the military. We’ve now rebuilt our military, stronger than it’s ever been, and we have so much ammunition. You wouldn’t believe it how much ammunition we have, but same thing here. We had a stockpile that was deficient. We had testing that was no good. We had a testing situation that just wasn’t right. It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken and it was only good for a very small situation, but what I’d like to do is I’d like to ask Dr. Fauci to come forward and discuss the number, because I think the number is going to be a very different number than the numbers that you talked about. Please, Doctor. You might talk about that. Deborah, please. Would you, can you explain the 2.2 million if we did nothing, because a lot of people would like to know that. I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, well, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing, we just rode it out, and I’ve been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they’ve been talking to me about it for a long time, other people have been asking that question, and I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive. Think of the number, potentially, 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn’t do the distancing, if we didn’t do all of the things that we’re doing. When you hear those numbers, you start to realize that, with the kind of work we went through last week, with the $2.2 trillion, it no longer sounds like a lot, right?  You’re talking about, when I heard the number today, first time I’ve heard that number, because I’ve been asking the same question that some people have been asking, I felt even better about what we did last week with the $2.2 trillion, because you’re talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million, and some people said it could even be higher than that. So you’re talking about 2.2 million deaths. 2.2 million people from this. If we can hold that down as we’re saying, to 100,000, it’s a horrible number. Maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 and 200,000, we altogether have done a very good job. 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that? I’m feeling very good about what we did last week. Yes, please. Go ahead, please. No. It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially, this was with our meeting before, on Easter, that could be a peak. That could be a peak period. That could be the peak, sadly to say, that could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down. No, that was aspirational. We had an aspiration of Easter, but when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don’t want to do anything where, you know, we don’t want to have it spike up. We don’t want to do it soon and then all of a sudden you go down, you’re coming down, and then you start going up again, because we discussed that could happen, and we don’t want that to happen. We’ve gone through too much.  That was an aspirational number. I didn’t say “Easter.” I said, “It would be a great thing if we could do it by Easter,” and we know much more now than we knew two, three weeks ago. Easter should be the peak number and it should start coming down and hopefully very substantially from that point. Okay, thank you. Please. OAN. Well, I don’t know. I know that, boy, that’s a nice question. Thank you very much. Yeah, I don’t want high approval ratings for this. I wish we could have our old life back. We had the greatest economy that we’ve ever had, and we didn’t have death. We didn’t have this. We didn’t have this horrible scourge, this plague, call it whatever you want. The virus. We’re working very hard, that’s all I know. I see things, I see numbers. They don’t matter to me. What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible. When you hear that 2.2 million people could have died if we didn’t go through all of this, and now the number will be a much lower number, hopefully it’s going to be the numbers that we’re talking about, so I appreciate it very much, but what I want is I want our life back again. I want our country back. I want the world back. I want the world to get rid of this. Again, 151 countries. And we’re going to do it. We’re going to have a great victory. We’re going to have a great victory. Go ahead, please. Well, that’s what they said. I told you what they’re going to take, copays in particular, that’s a big deal. Insurance companies don’t do that, and I appreciate it. Humana and Cigna, they should be getting a lot of credit for that. I don’t know. Those two are getting a lot of credit right now for it, and they should, because it’s something that, it’s a lot of money they’re waiving. We thank them. Will there be other companies? I wouldn’t be surprised. This great spirit, I’ll tell you what. Yeah, I’d love to have them do it. Let them waive those copays. There’s a great spirit in this country right now. I know insurance companies better than anybody. They just don’t do that. But now there’s a spirit like I have not seen. I have never seen anything like it. Even the media is much more fair. I wouldn’t say all of it, but that’s okay. They should be fair, because they should want this to end. This is about death. So I wan to thank Cigna and Humana. Thank you. They haven’t asked for reimbursement, so I assume they’re not. They said they’re going to waive them. Waiving them doesn’t mean we’re going to waive them and get reimbursed, no. Well, they’re going to be getting the money. I will tell you, I think landlords are going to take it easy. We may put out a statement on that. I think a lot of people that are owed money is going to take it easy. They don’t sort of have a choice, but a lot of concessions are made, just like the insurance companies. A lot of concessions are being made that wouldn’t have even been thought of three weeks ago, not even thought of. So a lot of really positive things are happening. Please, behind you. I didn’t do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said, “We’re going to look into possibly quarantine.” I didn’t say, “We’re going to quarantine.” I looked at it as a possibility, because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine. I said, “We’re going to look at it.” We then looked at it, you see? Who are you with? Bloomberg, right? I can’t imagine that. Let me just tell you, I didn’t threaten it. I don’t go around threatening. What happened is people, professionals, very good professionals, love the idea of doing that, because that’s sort of the ultimate in distancing. You can’t do, they didn’t want New Yorkers, where they’re having a problem, necessarily going down to Florida, where they have less of a problem, so the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me, really would love to do it. They would love to do it, and I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it. Also, it’s very hard to enforce. Okay, please. No, I think we made people aware to stay in your houses and do good. Now we did an advisory. It’s a strong advisory. The governors are running the advisory, the three governors. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and I think we did a great thing. All I did yesterday, as you know, you can see it, you can read it, you can read and you can see very simply that I said that we are looking into it, and then, before the end of the evening, substantially, we decided to go with the advisory, which, frankly, I liked better from the beginning. Go ahead. I didn’t say that. Why don’t you people act, let me ask you- Why don’t you act in a little more positive? It’s always trying to get you- Get you, get you, and you know what? That’s why nobody trusts the media anymore. That’s why people…  Excuse me, you didn’t hear me, that’s why you used to work for The Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something, be nice. Don’t be- … don’t be threatening, be nice. Go ahead. It’s not going to impact. We’re producing tremendous numbers of ventilators, we’re doing a great job on it, Mike Pence, our vice president, just headed up the task force, which has been incredible the job they’ve done, we have everybody in the White House working on it, everybody in the country is working on this in one way or the other, the fact is we’ve done a great job of delivering.  You’ve seen the biggest people in the business. I mean, there’s nobody even close to this group of people, we had a meeting at three o’clock, it lasted for a long time, it was a great meeting with the generals, and with everybody else, and they have done a fantastic job.  I’m just saying this, if they’re holding … Let me give you one example, we sent thousands of generators to New York, they were put into a warehouse, a New York warehouse, that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey, they were given to New York, and we then went to other places also giving thousands of ventilators.  The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, “Why didn’t you distribute them?” Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses, they knew they had them, so we said, “Why didn’t you distribute them?” I hope they’ve distributed them now, but maybe they didn’t need them so badly, but just so you know, we’re all, you, me, everybody, we’re all on the same team.  When journalists get up, and you’re a journalist, a fine journalist, when journalists get up- … and ask questions that are so threatening, we’re all on the same team. Take a look at my interview, what I want to do is if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it. When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000 and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is shocked, he knows all about the virus by the way, he’s not surprised by that, he knows all about it, he shouldn’t be surprised, he should say, “Well, they’re standard because this is really a very tough disease. This is really a very tough virus to handle.” Okay, please go ahead- Go ahead. That’s enough, thank you very much. Please, please, that’s enough. That’s enough. That’s enough. That’s not fair to your other reporters. It’s not fair, you had a long time, a long question. If we have time I’ll get back to you for your second question, is that okay? All right, thank you. I appreciate it. Well, we don’t know that, but we think the peak will hit. Right. That is our two- … doctors here. Well I can, I think I’ll ask doctor and doctor, maybe you could both come up and give your opinion on that, because that’s really … Okay, please. Just to finish what … So what both were saying, and what Dr. Fauci just brought up, we don’t want to do well and then end a little bit early and have it start going up again, because that would be a disaster. Go ahead, please. Yes. Yes. Yes, we are. In fact, I met last night with our people, we’re sending them a lot of different things that we’re not needing because we’re obviously in need of a lot also, and we’re also helping them monetarily.  We are helping Italy a lot, we’re working very closely with Italy, and we’re working closely with Spain too, which is really hit hard, and we’re working with everybody. I spoke with Angela Merkel the other day, Germany’s hit hard, their mortality rate is different I think because they do more testing, but their mortality rate is much different.  Italy’s mortality rate is very high, so is Spain, but we’re working very closely with them, yes. We had a big meeting on it last night. Admiral Giroir, would you please come up and just talk a little bit about the tremendous success that’s been made on testing from where we started? Thank you. Thank you Giroir. Thank you Admiral very much, yeah please, go ahead. Well, I don’t have to tell you because those companies have come into line, they’re doing a great job, they’re working very hard 24 hours round the clock, so I don’t want to give their names now because they’ve been great, they’ve come into line. And by the way, General Motors is doing a fantastic job, I don’t think we have to worry about General Motors now, they’ve really, done their job.  And what the Admiral said also, I think we can add this Admiral, the reason we show more cases than anybody else in the world is we’re doing more testing than anybody else in the world, so we have more cases because we’re doing far more testing than anybody in the world. And remember, we started with a system that was broken, for many years it was broken, and I’m not blaming the last administration, I’m saying other administrations, and our pipeline had very little in it, just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical, we had very little in our pipeline.  Now we have ammunition more than hopefully we’ll ever need, and we also have a pipeline that’s packed, and now we have those 10,000 ventilators that we can use because you need some quickly, I mean this goes quickly from place to place. I’d love to give them all out right now, but we need them quickly. I don’t want to give them out and then we have to take them back and move them someplace else. So we’re very much prepared. Please. Well, I think you’re going to find that almost all states … Look, I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we’re doing, and I’ll tell you what, if you had a different administration, they would not have been happy. These are people that speak their mind, they were happy.  It was falsely reported by a couple of people that, “Oh gee, they weren’t.” They were happy, they were thrilled. Florida has been taken care of, and Michigan has been taken care of, very important state. To me it’s very important because I’m so proud of what we’ve done bringing car companies back into Michigan, and we’re now dealing with the governor, and I think, Mike, I can say that a lot of good things are happening in Michigan, Massachusetts, we’re dealing with the governor very strongly, and we’re trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible. Well, Florida, look, they’re very aggressive in trying to get things, and they’re doing a very good job, but I think I can say all of the governors are very committed, we’re very committed, we’re working together, and we’re getting things out at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. You can speak to FedEx, you can speak to UPS, you can speak, they’ve never done anything like this, what they’re doing right now, and nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do. If we left that to government it would have been a tough thing. We have mobilized private enterprise, we have mobilized the greatest companies in the world, and what’s happening is incredible.  And that includes Abbott, where Abbott comes out and all of a sudden out of nowhere comes up with this incredible test that simplifies everything, it makes it so easy. So I think you’re going to find most states are very happy. I’m dealing with the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, he’s a Democrat, if that’s what you’re getting at, but I’m dealing with him very successfully, I think he’s very happy. I think he’s actually amazed at what he’s been able to get.  In fact, we were even forward-thinking, I suggested we send additional ventilators and other things, we’re building a hospital in Louisiana, very importantly, we’re building hospitals in New Jersey, Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy, and frankly he’s got a pretty hotspot right there, right next to New York, and we’re doing hospitals, we’re doing ventilators, we’re getting a lot to Governor Murphy, that’s New Jersey. Last night I spoke- … to the governor of Connecticut, we had a great talk with him, we are really doing the job.  Look, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he’s been terrific. We send them a boat way ahead of schedule, the ship way ahead of schedule, hospital ship, The Mercy, with 1,000 beds, operating rooms, and it’s been in LA for three days already.  So, I think they’re really happy, and when you think about it, in New York we built 2,900 hospital rooms, beds, nobody’s ever seen it before. The governor has never seen anything like that before, this was done by federal government, not by state government, this was done by the federal government, they’re opening it tomorrow.  I wanted to be there so badly, but Secret Service and all of the people involved won’t let me, they won’t let me. I would love to be there, but they won’t let me for obvious reasons, but I would’ve loved to have been at the opening tomorrow of the hospital in New York at Javits Center.  But we’re very proud of the job we’ve done, we’ve mobilized, and getting better and better every day, and the taskforce headed by your vice president, the job they’ve done, and they don’t even sleep. Okay, any other questions? Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We’re ranking counties, and we’re ranking states, and a lot of people put out false information because they don’t know what they’re talking about, and we took over a dead barren system, we took over a system that was obsolete, it was good for a tiny little sample of people, and even that didn’t work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is the test didn’t work.  That wasn’t from us, that’s been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world, and nobody has, now they’re all calling, “Can we get the quick test?” We call it the quick test, where, by the way, probably more accurate and it takes a few minutes. I mean, it’s pretty amazing what we’ve done. Now, we’re getting along great with the governors, yeah go ahead, please. No, go ahead please. Yeah, thank you. Well, we hope not, but we think it’s going to … we have aspirational thoughts, we would have loved to have been a little bit sooner, but we have to do it right.  We could have done it, we could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it’s coming down, or if it’s still going up, maybe it’s going to be coming down by then, but we just felt it was too soon.  We can’t take a chance. Again, because of what we’ve done, and because of the fact that we’ve stopped the flow from China so early, because the question is, from a lot of my friends, “Why don’t we just wing it? Why didn’t we just wing it?” And I kept asking, and we did models now, finally we got these models in, and you hear about the 2.2 million people would have died.  I don’t mean we would have had 2.2 million cases, these are 2.2 million people would have died, 2.2 million people. Look, we’re going to have a meeting, or speech, or press conference, or something on Tuesday, I thought what I’d do, I was going to announce the end of April on Tuesday, but I said let’s do it now, because somewhere along the line it’s going to leak, we might as well just do it now and get rid of all the leaks, this way it didn’t, nice and clean.  But we have to really do a great job for another couple of weeks, and I think we’re going to be in great shape, and we’re going to be in a position, even with what we’re trying to do with restaurants, with deductability, we have to get these restaurants back in, we have to get our businesses open, we have to get the planes flying, we have to get everything going, we have to get even the cruise ships, I mean we have to get those cruise ships moving along.  We had the greatest economy in the history of the world three weeks ago, and now we’ve said, “Please don’t work anymore.” We’re actually paying people not to work. Nobody’s ever heard that, that’s not for us. People want to work, but at the same time, and I’m so glad that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx gave us a number, and the number on the outside, and maybe it’s not even on the outside, we don’t know, is 2.2 million people would have died if we didn’t do what we’re doing.  And now we’re looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that, and it makes everything we’re doing feel much better to me. Please, go ahead. That would be fine, finish it. Go ahead. I was going to call on you next, you know that. Well, I could ask Dr. Fauci to come up, but it’s common sense. You’re going to have massive depression, meaning mental depression, you’re going to have depression in the economy also, but you’re going to have mental depression for people, you’re going to have large numbers of suicides, take a look at what happens in a really horrible recession or worse, so you’re going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you’re going to have more than anything else? Drug addiction.  You will see drugs being used like nobody’s ever used them before, and people are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction, because you would have people that had a wonderful job at a restaurant, or even owned a restaurant, I spoke to great people today that have done a great job, and one day they’re at the top of their business, they’re celebrity chefs, they’ve got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing, they’ve gotten wiped out, one day, from our enemy, this invisible, horrible scourge.  So, when you ask me that, it’s so easy to figure that, I mean, massive drug use, massive depression, mental depression, massive numbers of suicide, anxiety causes disease, they say, a lot of people … you’re going to have tremendous, and hopefully we’re not going to have that, because hopefully, by what we’re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don’t have to … … by what we’re doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don’t have 2.2 million deaths. We have a number that’s much less, much, much less, and at the same time, we get our country running again. Please, thank you - Thank you very much. You were next. He was very nice in doing it, though, nevertheless. Go head- Which is very unusual for CNN. I don’t think so- It’s a great question, actually, and I asked that the same. I said, “How about Nebraska? How about Idaho? How about Iowa?” You know what? Those people are so great, the whole Midwest, I don’t think they want to be in that position, actually. Probably, I was given a pretty strong look by these two people. They said, “We don’t like that idea”, so we’re relying on them. They’re the best in their profession and they didn’t like the idea. We could do it, but I don’t think it would be good. I didn’t say that - I didn’t say that - No  it’s such a - Excuse me, are you ready? Ready? Ready? Take a look at what I said. I want them to be appreciative of me, and then you cut it off because it’s fake news, CNN - Please, please, let me just finish. You just said it again and you know the answer’s a lie. You know that - Let me just  say - Your statement and your response and your answer is a lie because here’s the story. Are you ready? I said, “I want you to be appreciative of me”, and then you go on and then I go on and you cut it off, but it says - Thank you. Thank you. I don’t call - I don’t call, no- I don’t call. No  I don’t call the Governor of Washington now- But Mike Pence calls and the Head of FEMA calls. I don’t stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative Mike to Washington? The State of Washington? Michigan, I love that state. That’s  one of my favorite places in the whole world, Michigan, and I’m so proud of what’s happened with the auto industry. It’s coming back to Michigan. No, I don’t have to call because I’m probably better off not. He’s a failed Presidential candidate. He’s a nasty person. I don’t like the Governor of Washington, so you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the Head of FEMA to call. I get the Admiral to call, but what you didn’t say… See, you started it off and you talked about, “I have to be appreciated”, but then when you read the rest - It said, “Because if you don’t appreciate you’re not respecting these incredible people, the two admirals. You’re not appreciating FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers who built 2900 beds in three and a half days and you’re not appreciating all of the work that’s been done and you’re not appreciating these incredible people from private enterprise that are delivering things in numbers nobody’s ever seen. See, that’s why people aren’t watching CNN very much anymore. That’s why they don’t like it. That’s why you’re ratings are no good because you even after knowing the truth for days now, you bring up the old lie. Read the rest of your question, the rest of your statement you didn’t put in. You have to put that in and it said in there FEMA and it said in there Army Corps of Engineers because when they disrespect me, they’re disrespecting our government. You know what? I don’t mind if I’m disrespected, but they can’t disrespect the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA. Okay- Please, go ahead. I want them to appreciate the incredible job we’re doing. We are doing a job the likes of which has never been done before and there are a couple of people that know that, but for political reasons, let’s say they’re Democrats. They don’t want to give this administration credit, and that’s okay  but I don’t have to deal with them  but our Vice President does deal with them. Please, go ahead. That’s why CNN is not trusted anymore. They are not trusted. They are fake news. Remember that. Go ahead. Yes you are. Go ahead. Yeah. No, we think it’s going to really start to open up. We think that that’s going to be the bottom of the hill. That’s where we’re looking at, June 1st, maybe even a little bit sooner than that. We have this hill. If we did nothing, the hill would have been up here. We did a lot. We did just about maximum and we got lucky because we stopped China from coming in and then later on we stopped Europe. We got lucky. We got very lucky. The people that were coming in here, they went to Italy, they went to Spain, they went to other countries. We got lucky and they got unlucky, to be honest with you. You look at what’s going on in Italy and Spain in particular. No, I don’t want that. June 1st, we think we can reach the bottom of that hill on June 1st and that would be a great thing. I have confidence of the two doctors. I think that could be a day. It could even be sooner. It could be a little bit later. It could be sooner, but I think people would be very happy if we did a job and saved potentially millions of lives, I think people would be very happy with that date. Okay  yes, please - Well, I’m prepared to do whatever’s necessary to, number one, save lives, and number two, bring our economy back strong just like it was before. I think our economy has a chance to be just as good and even better than it was before. Remember, a lot of the money that you read about, that’s all coming back. These are loans to great companies that got stopped from doing business. They’ll be back very soon, so much of the money that we’re talking about, that money’s coming back and we’ll take warrants, meaning we’ll take pieces of the company for the taxpayers of our nation. I expect that we’ll make a lot of money with that money. We’re going to make a lot of money, and that’s okay. I don’t even want to talk about making money because what I want to talk about is two things. Number one is saving lives, and number two is bringing our economy back, but I think we’re going to do very well. That whole money is a lot of it’s coming back. Please. No, I know exactly what you’re saying. No, I’ve read that - Well, I read that CNN doesn’t want to cover them, except that they can’t help them because their ratings are so high. If the ratings were low, they wouldn’t be here. This man wouldn’t be here. In a hundred years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all of their cameras if they’re bad because we help their ratings. We lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low, but for the most part I haven’t heard that. I will say The Washington Post has a drive on not to go to the President of the United States news conference because, frankly, so many people are watching. We’re getting the word out, we’re getting the accurate word out, and a lot of people are happy about it and a lot of people aren’t, but they should be happy. When I have the General, when I have Seema and when I have Tony and when I have our… these are all people that have become big stars, but they’ve done a great job. Deborah has done a fantastic… All of these people, they don’t want to be stars. You know what they want? They want to win. They want to win the battle against the virus. They’ve been fighting this stuff their whole life, between Ebola and swine flu and, I don’t know, I’m not sure I’d love your life, but that’s what you like, right? That’s what they do. They fight disease, and you know what? There’s nobody that does it better. I think the American public, ultimately, they should be the decider. If they don’t want to watch, they shouldn’t watch and we shouldn’t have bigger ratings than The Bachelor, or as The New York Times said, we have Monday Night Football-type ratings. Now, I didn’t say that. I have no idea what they are in a sense, but I know that The Times, they say that it’s all the news that’s fit to print, I say it’s all the news that’s not fit to print because I think they are not honest people, but that’s okay. They can’t help it, but even they said that the ratings are like Monday Night Football ratings and that these are like Bachelor Finale. That’s their end when the big deal happened. I have no idea what happened because I’m too busy working on this. Somebody will tell me what happened. No, I think it’s terrible. When they don’t want the President of the United States to have a voice, you’re not talking about democracy any longer. Please. Thank you very much. No. No, and this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people were saying maybe we shouldn’t do anything, just ride it. They say ride it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through. That’s where the 2.2 million people come in. Would have died maybe, but it would have been 1.6 to 2.2, and that’s not acceptable, but there were a lot of people that said… I thought about it. I said, “Maybe we should ride it through.” You know you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We’re in the midst of a bad flu season. You know we had a bad season last year as an example, a bad flu season. You’ll have 35, 36, 37,000 people die, sometimes more, sometimes less. This is different and part of this is the unknown. Part of it also is the viciousness of it. I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He’s a little older and he’s heavy, but he’s a tough person. He went to the hospital and a day later he’s in a coma. I go, “How’s he doing?” “Sir, he’s in a coma. He’s unconscious.” He’s not doing well. The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it’s horrible. It’s really horrible. Please, go ahead. Yeah. I don’t think it’s a rumor, I think it’s a fact and Louisiana has been hit hard. Louisiana is an example. It started off with like nobody for so long when I spoke to the Governor, but Deborah or Tony, either of you, if you’d like to talk about it? I think I’m waiting for that little 45-minute test. I sort of like that, or now it’s down to five minutes I understand. No, I haven’t, but I think I will take it again if it’s appropriate. I don’t feel there’s any symptoms. Have you noticed any sniffles? Nothing, right? So far I haven’t felt that way, but you know there was a big strong point made originally. I think it still holds. Take the test if you need it if you have the symptoms. If you don’t, don’t take it. That’s put out by the professionals, so I don’t have it, but I would take it. I just wanted to say one thing also about what Tony had mentioned. I grew up in Queens, New York, and right next to a place called Elmhurst, Queens. They have a hospital that’s a very good hospital, Elmhurst Hospital. I’ve known it, I’ve known where it is. I can tell you the color on the outside, the size of the windows. I mean, I know it very well. It was near my community where I lived. I’ve been watching that for the last week on television. Body bags all over in hallways. I’ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks. They’re freezer trucks because they can’t handle the bodies there’s so many of them. This is essentially in my community in Queens, New York. I’ve seen things that I’ve never seen before. I mean, I’ve seen them but I’ve seen them on television in far away lands. I’ve never seen them in our country. Elmhurst Hospital, unbelievable people. I mean, when I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies, and these are trucks that are as long as The Rose Garden and they’re pulling up to take out bodies and you look inside and you see the black body bags. You say, “What’s in there?” It’s Elmhurst Hospital, must be supplies. It’s not supplies, it’s people. I’ve never seen anything like it. These people are doing a fantastic job, and somebody else who’s doing a fantastic job is sitting here who is the Head of the Task Force and I just maybe want to finish off because I’d like to ask Mike, what do you think about what we’ve done? Where do you think we’re going? How do you feel also? You studied this so closely. How do you feel about the curve and the June 1st date? That’s aspirational, but I think that’s really modified aspirational because I think we’re going to hit it and maybe we’ll even beat it. Okay, Mike, please. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike. I just want to end by saying that we’re all in this together, all of us. I have never seen anything like it. The unity, the esprit de corps, the spirit, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a beautiful thing to watch. Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It’s death. A lot of people are dying, so it’s very unpleasant. It’s a very unpleasant thing to go through, but the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love, I just think it’s brilliant and it’s possibly happening in other countries, possibly. I don’t know, I can’t speak to other countries, but I can speak to the United States of America, and I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
"Appreciate you being here. Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April. This is based on modeling that show us the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks. The same modeling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives. Think of that, 1 million American lives. Our future is in our own hands and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory. We will have a great victory. We have no other choice. Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war. Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus. This is our shared patriotic duty. Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days so important because we have to get back.  But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis. And that’s the time we’re waiting for. The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives and they will be great lives. Maybe better than ever. Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus. Over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far, not even close and tested accurately. And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now, more than 1 million tests. Please. Thank you Alex. Thank you very much. Thank you. I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn come up FTA because we have some really good stuff. First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead we’re going to go even faster and we have something from Abbott Labs which is right here and that’s a five minute test, highly accurate. I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA commissioner, the job he’s done in the approval process. We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now. I thought that I’d mentioned it but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York and it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that. It was a really rapid approval. And Dr., please say a few words. This is the first one on the line of the five minute test from Abbott. Great job. Really great job. Thank you, Steve. So the pharmaceutical company , has been working with us very closely. And as Alex mentioned, a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government. It’s been given. And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to US hospitals. 6 million doses. So the private sector as you’d say, Steve, it’s been amazing what’s happened. Really amazing. And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go. And they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing. And then we have so many more.  The FDA has also authorized the materials, N95 respirator mask sterilization kits. It’s an incredible thing. I’ve been asking why are we throwing these masks away? You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment that I say, how come you throw them away? Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques? And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio. And he’s a tremendous guy, tremendous governor. And he said, we have a company named  and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA. And I called up Dr. Hahn and within a very short period of time, they got the approval. Steve, we really appreciate it. I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve. And they’re going to be able, each machine now, can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. Now think of that. Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. It’ll be just like a new one. It could go up to about 20 times for each mask.  Each mask can go through this process 20 times. They have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington D.C. So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks. This morning I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need. Yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis. And Mike, thank you for the great job. Thank you very much.  In New York, the 2,900 bed hospital under construction, which is now completed. They completed it in three days. You might say three and a half days, at the Javits Center, will be completed today. When you look … So they’re going up, I think we’re going to be adding some more beds which will be completed today. We’ve opened up … Whoops, there goes our box and my hair’s blowing around and it’s mine. The one thing you can’t get away with if it’s not yours you got a problem if you’re President. A nearly 3000 medical beds will become operational. The US Navy ship Comfort also arrived today equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1000 hospital beds. Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites including a 600 bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn and numerous floors of a high rise building on Wall Street. It’s been really a pretty amazing what they’ve done, the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done.  They just completed, think of it, a 2,900 bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days. And the whole city’s talking about it. On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be a thousand rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on and that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on. So it’s been great. The Army Corps of Engineers is awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities also. At the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury and the Westchester Community Center, we’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today. We have a total of 60 we’re getting some additional ones with up to 190 more to follow at different locations.  To date, FEMA has obligated more than $1.3 billion dollars in federal support to the state of New York. We’re spending a lot of money in New York. It’s a hotbed, there’s no question about it. And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey. Spoke with governor Cuomo a lot, spoke with governor Murphy a lot in New Jersey, and we’re really getting the job done. People are very impressed and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers, because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody doing anything like it.  In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered, over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1000. 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly. 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana and 50 to Connecticut. FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns and 22 million gloves. And I don’t know if you just saw, it just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days.  And top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors, but we have a nine other companies doing ventilators. As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy, we’re going to be sending them to France. We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems and other countries as we can. But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies. More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local…  … Have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment where we’re sending a lot. We have plane loads coming in. We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world and they’re landing. We had our first big cargo plane land this morning and we’re getting it from all over the world and we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts. I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy and we have additional capacity. We have additional product that we don’t need. We’re going to be sending approximately a hundred million dollars worth of things, of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy and Giuseppe was very, very happy. I will tell you that they haven’t a very hard time.  Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs. What they’re doing is incredible and these are great companies. Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell, you know that, and Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past and he’s a great leader of a great company.  Debra Waller of Jockey International. A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow. Boy, do you sell those pillows? That’s unbelievable what you do. David Taylor of Procter and Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation and I just want to tell all of you that America’s very grateful to you and what you’ve done. Amazing job you’ve done and we thank you very much.  I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words if you might about your companies. Mike, come on up. Come on up fellas. Please come on up. You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible. Go ahead, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Please come on up. I did not know he was going to do that but he’s a friend of mine and I do appreciate it. Thank you, Mike, very much. Please. Fantastic. Thank you. Normally I’d shake his hand but we’re not supposed to do that anymore. So that’s okay. Great job. Thank you to Honeywell. Please, go ahead. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Fantastic. Great company.  Those a great companies. Thank you very much. I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been. I really appreciate it. Come on up, Seema Verma. Thank you very much. You were fantastic , and you’re doing a great job. So we are in the midst of something that is very difficult but we are going to win. It’s just a question of when. We want to do it as quickly as possible. We want to have as few deaths as possible and we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing. I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back. We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much, but we will have lost a lot of people and in many ways they hear us.  And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger there. They’re warriors. Men and women are doing a job the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen. I see them coming out of planes today going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas. And they go in there and they just want to do the job. And you see the numbers, you see the numbers, I see the numbers. I have some friends that are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild stay and in one case, he’s unconscious in a coma. And you say, how did that happen?  So I just want to thank all of the great professionals, men and women, doctors and nurses and paramedics and fast responders and law enforcement. By the way, if you look at New York and you see the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible. These are great people, firefighters, great people. They’re helping in so many different ways. So thank you very much. And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. John, please. They’ll be staying, and we may add a few more, but the guidelines will be very much as they are, maybe even toughened up a little bit, but they’re having a big impact. They are having a tremendous impact and we’re starting to see it. And that’s the key, we’re starting to see the impact that they’re having. Well, I think that some are ramping up to a level that they’re not going to have to, John, and I think that we also have kept in reserve. We have almost 10,000 ventilators in our line. We’ve held back just because we did the stockpile, we didn’t want to give them because we don’t know where the emergency… it hits so fast. It comes so quickly, and we have 10,000. We’re probably going to send some of them now. We’ve been sending a lot to Michigan and various other states. We’ll probably send some additional ones to Michigan. New York’s been doing very well, but we can add some more to New York. We’re adding them to the areas that are having a problem.  Even Alabama, all of a sudden a flared up a little bit as you saw over the last couple of days and we’ll send them down to Alabama. So we have 10,000, we kept them for this very specific purpose. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not when you think about it, but we’re making a lot and when you see, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands being made in a very short period of time because if you look at what just… so we have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators. And we say go ahead because honestly, other countries really, they’ll never be able to do it. It’s a complex piece of equipment and it’s big and expensive. Yes. I do think so. I think we’re going to be in very good shape, and we had a great call today with the governors and they were, I actually said, “I hope that the media is listening to this call,” because it was a really good call and that was randomly selected largely Democrats and Republicans in there. I think for the most part they were saying thank you for doing a great job and we discussed that at the end of the call. So really, people are very happy with what we’re doing. Now the circumstances are so terrible because of what’s going on, but I think they’re very impressed by the Federal government.  I watched that beautiful ship floating in today into, weeks ahead of schedule, almost four weeks ahead of schedule into New York Harbor, Comfort. And I watched the Mercy floating in to Los Angeles a week ago, almost a week ago. And they are stocked. They are really ready to go. They’re stocked with both talent and tremendous amounts of equipment and the Navy and everybody else involved, they got it ready so fast. It’s just incredible what they can do. They’ve geared up. That’s why I mean, I am so impressed by the people involved. Mike and I were talking about it before, the level of genius to put it all together so quickly. A month ago nobody ever heard of this. Nobody had any idea that Mercy was being maintained.  It was in maintenance for a month. And when they heard we needed it, and I was surprised, they said, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I said, “What do you mean? You’re not going to be ready for three weeks?” “No sir, we’re all ready to go.” It was incredible. And we’ve had many instances like this. I think the building of the hospital, 2,900 beds in a matter of days, a few days is just incredible. Governor Cuomo was impressed and Gavin Newsome was impressed by what we’ve been doing with Gavin in California in Los Angeles area in particular, but really San Francisco, all over, all over California. When you look at what we’re doing with Michigan, we’re getting along very well with Michigan’s, great place. We’re sending a lot of things to Michigan because that’s becoming a hotbed, especially a specific area as you know, it’s become very hot.  It’s become, I don’t know, could even at some point supersede, but it’s got to be taken care of. So the relationship we have with the governors, I just wish you could… because we took a lot of calls from a lot of different states and I wish you could have heard, even a thing where the governor of Ohio calls where he has a company that does the sterilization, but they have a problem because it’s not going quickly at the FDA. And I call up Steve and Steve comes and he said, “We’ll get it done.” And they checked it and they got it done almost immediately. And originally they were approving it for 10,000 masks and then it was supposed to be for 80 and they ultimately approved it for 120,000. I mean, it’s a tremendous number.  And I kept wondering, why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? I assumed maybe you couldn’t do it, but then I’d look at them and they’d look like it’s not cloth. It’s something that looks like it could be sterilized and that’s what they’ve done and that’s the machine that is over there actually. They have a piece of the machine over there. I won’t bother showing it to you. And this is incredible when you talk about five minutes, 15 minutes and highly accurate and not nearly as disturbing to do as the other tests. So we’ve just gotten better. We’re doing things that nobody else ever thought of. Please. Well, we’re letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want with our supervision and they consult with us in all cases. Some go further than others as you know. I mean, I could give you plenty of examples, but I’m not going to do that because we never want to be controversial, but some of the governors have taken it a step further- … and people are questioning that, but look, staying at home with respect to what we’re talking about doesn’t bother me at all. People should be staying at home. That’s what we want.  please. . Well, I think what we’re doing is we’re trying to, as a group, governors and that’s Republicans and Democrats, we’re just working together to solve this problem. What you’re mentioning has been going on for a long time and it’s a sad event, a lot of sad events in this country, but what we’re doing is now we’re working on the virus, we’re working on that hidden enemy and I think we’re doing a great job on, as good a job as you can possibly do. When when Tony and Deborah came up with numbers yesterday to say that if we did nothing, you could lose 2.2, up to 2., maybe beyond, I don’t know, maybe beyond, but 2.2 million people if we did nothing. And I can’t tell you what the unfortunate final toll is going to be, but it’s going to be a very small fraction of that.  So we’re doing an awfully good job I think with what we’re doing. Please go ahead. Please. Well, we’ve talked about it. Obviously there are some parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others. There are other parts that frankly are not in trouble at all. So hopefully, we’re going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we’re doing. So we talked about quarantine as you know, the other day a group came to me and they wanted to do the quarantine and I said, “Let’s think about it.” And we did it, we studied it. And by the time the evening came, it just was something that was very unwieldy, very tough to enforce and something we didn’t want to do. But we did advisory. And I think that’s doing well. I mean, I look at the streets, you look at New York where there’s… I looked down Fifth Avenue today, they were showing a shot of Fifth Avenue in Primetime and there was almost nobody on Fifth Avenue.  I’ve never seen that before. There was no car, there was no anything. So I think the people of this country have done an incredible job. If we do that, we will let you know. But it’s pretty unlikely I would think at this time. Yes. Please come. Thank you very much. Thanks. It is amazing. You look at Louisiana and for a long time it was just staying at-  For a long time, it was just staying at nothing. And then all of a sudden, I look one day and I see a lot and a lot and a lot, and then it explodes. And now, we’re working very carefully and very powerfully with them. We’re building hospitals, we’re building a lot of different things for Louisiana. So, it’s very important. Yeah, please go ahead. Yeah. We’re prepared, I hope it doesn’t happen. Doctor, would you like to say something about that? I hope it doesn’t happen, but we’re certainly prepared. Okay. Please, go ahead. Yeah, very interesting, I saw it. Well, we haven’t discussed it to that extent, but it’s certainly something we could discuss. We’re getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things… I saw his suggestion on that, so we’ll take a look at it. For a period of time, not forever. I mean, we want our country back. We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear. People could… I could see something like that happening for a period of time. But I would hope it would be a very limited period of time, doctors. They’ll come back and say, for the rest of our lives we have to wear masks. Well, the GPS, that’s the very severe idea. I’ve been hearing about it, GPS. So, what happens? A siren goes off if you get too close to somebody. That’s pretty severe. But he’s somebody who was with me for a long time. He worked… They did a great job at FDA. So, we’re going to take a look. I just received it a little while ago, he sent it over. So very good. Go ahead. Let’s give it a shot. Here we go. , it will go away. And I do want them to stay calm. And we are doing a great job. If you look at those individual statements, they’re all true. Stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away and it will go away, and we’re going to have a great victory. And it’s people like you and CNN that say things like that, that… It’s why people just don’t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. The statements I made are, I want to keep the country calm, I don’t want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you. I could do much… I would make you look like a minor league player. But you know what? I don’t want to do that. I want to have our country be calm and strong and fight and win. And it will go away.  And it is incredible the job that all of these people are doing, putting them all together, the job that they’re doing. I am very proud of the job they’re doing, that Mike Pence is doing, that the task force has done, that Honeywell and Procter & Gamble and Mike and all of these people have done. I’m very proud. It’s almost a miracle. And it is, the way it’s all come together. And instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. And other than that, I’m going to go to somebody else. Please, go ahead. Please. Well, I expressed what was told to me by a tremendous power in the business. He said that at a New York hospital, for a long period of time, he was giving 10,000, maybe maximum 20,000 masks, over a short time. And all of a sudden, he’s giving 300,000. And I said, “No matter how bad this is, could that be possible?” He said, “No.” So there’s only a couple of that could happen. Is it going out the back door? And I’ve reported it to the city, and let the city take a look at it. But when you go from 10,000 masks to 300,000 masks, Mike, over the same period of time, there’s something going on. Now, I’m not making any charges, but when everyone’s looking for masks… And by the way, that’s another thing, we’re making a lot of masks and the sterilization process is going to save a lot of time and a lot of masks.  But, when you have the biggest distributor of product that distributes to many of the big hospitals and hospital chains, and he brings up a statistic like that… And I know you’re trying to make a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t be. You should actually go over to the hospital and find out why. You shouldn’t be asking me. I’m just saying, that’s the way it is. You should go over there as a great reporter. I have no idea who you are, but that’s okay. You should go over there. Go to the hospital and find out, how come you used to get 10,000 masks and you had a full hospital? New York City always full. And how come now you have 300,000 masks? Despite the virus and all, you have three… How do you go from 10 to 300,000? And this is very serious stuff. I mean, I could see from 10 to 20 or from 10 to 40 or 50 or something, but how do you go from 10 to 300,000 masks? So what I think you should do as a… I’m sure you’re a wonderful investigative reporter, you should go to the hospital and find out why. Steve, please. Well, it’s so bad for the economy. But the economy is number two on my list. First, I want to save a lot of lives. We’re going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast. Steve is just asking about the economy, what’s it like? We basically shut down our country. And we did that in order to keep people separated, keep people apart. They’re not working in offices, they’re not in airplanes together. We’ve really shut it down. And 150/151 other countries are pretty much shut down. But here with the… We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. And I had to go from doing a great job for three years, to shutting it down. But you know what? We’re going to build it up and we’re going to build it up rapidly. And I think in the end, we’ll be stronger for it. We learned a lot.  And I have to say, we’ve had great relationships with a lot of countries. China sent us some stuff which was terrific. Russia sent us a very large plane load of things, medical equipment, which was very nice. Other countries sent us things that I was very surprised at. Very happily surprised. We learned a lot. We’re learning a lot. And we’re also learning, that the concept of borders is very important, Steve. It’s very important. Having borders is very important. But, we have done an incredible job. The economy is going to come back. My focus is saving lives. That’s the only focus I could have. We’re going to bring the economy back and we’ll bring it back fast. Yeah, please. Go ahead. Please. Yeah. Well, it’s very much on par. Look- Per capita. We have areas of country that’s very wide. I know South Korea better than anybody, it’s a very tight… You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is? 38 million people. That’s bigger than anything we have. 38 million people all tightly wound together. We have vast farmlands. We have vast areas where they don’t have much of a problem. In some cases, they have no problem whatsoever. We have done more tests. Well, I didn’t talk about per capita. We have done more tests by far than any country in the world, by far. Our testing is also better than any country in the world. And when you looking at that, as simple as that looks, that’s something that’s a game changer. And every country wants that, every country. So, rather than asking a question like that, you should congratulate the people that have done this testing. Because, we inherited this administration, inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny small group of people. But, once you got beyond that, it didn’t work. We have built an incredible system to the fact, where we have now done more tests than any other country in the world. And now the technology is really booming.  I just spoke to… Well, I spoke to a lot… I’m not going to even mention. I spoke to a number of different testing companies today. And the job that they’ve done and the job that they’re doing, is incredible. But when Abbott comes out and does this so quickly, it’s really unreal. In fact, one company, I have to say, that stands out in the job, and I think I can say this, I don’t want to insult anybody else, but Roche. Roche, is been incredible in the testing job they’ve done. And they’re ramping it up exponentially, it’s up. And you should be saying, congratulations, instead of asking a really snarky question, because I know exactly what you mean by that. You should be saying, congratulations to the men and women who have done this job, who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great. And if you don’t say it, I’ll say it. I want to congratulate all of the people, you have done a fantastic job. And we will see you all tomorrow, thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you very much everyone. Our country is in the midst of a great national trial, unlike any we have ever faced before. You all see it. You see it probably better than most. We’re at war with a deadly virus. Success in this fight will require the full absolute measure of our collective strength, love, and devotion. It’s very important. Each of us has the power through our own choices and actions to save American lives and rescue the most vulnerable among us. That’s why we really have to do what we all know is right. Every citizen is being called upon to make sacrifices. Every business is being asked to fulfill its patriotic duty. Every community is making fundamental changes to how we live, work and interact each and every day, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see this going on long into the future when this virus is gone and defeated.  Some of the things we’re doing now will be very good practice for the future, including for not getting the flu, which is very devastating also. So some of what we’re learning now will live on into the future. I really believe that shaking hands or not shaking hands, washing hands all the time, staying a little apart. 15 days ago we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread of the virus. On Sunday, I announced that this campaign will be extended until April 30th. In a few moments, Dr. Birx will explain the data that formed the basis for our decision to extend the guidelines and Dr. Fauci will explain why it’s absolutely critical for the American people to follow the guidelines for the next 30 days. It’s a matter of life and death, frankly. It’s a matter of life and death.  I know our citizens will rise to the occasion and they already have sacrificed a lot. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We’re the greatest economy in the world. We had the best unemployment numbers and employment numbers that we’ve ever had by far, and in one instant we said we have no choice but to close it up. Just as Americans have always done, they will do a job like few have seen before and they’re proud to do it. And I see that there’s a great pride going on right now. Before we hear from our experts, we have a few other announcements.  Today, the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration announced further details on the paycheck protection program, which was made possible by the $2 trillion relief bill I signed into law last week. Nearly $350 billion in loans will soon be available through lending partners to help small businesses meet payroll and other expenses for up to two months. These loans will be forgiven as long as businesses keep paying their workers. This includes sole proprietors and independent contractors. Applications will be accepted starting this Friday, April 3rd. So on Friday, April 3rd, that’s when it begins.  Earlier today, I spoke with leading internet and phone providers who are doing a tremendous job of keeping our internet and the lines of communication flowing under very strongly increase strain the businesses more than anybody has seen before because everyone’s inside. They’re all making calls. Among the leaders I spoke to were Hans Vestberg a Verizon Communications, Randall Stephenson of AT&T, Mike Sievert of T-Mobile, Thomas Rutledge of Charter Communications, Brian Roberts of Comcast, John Malone of Liberty Media, Dexter Goie of Altice, Michel Combes of Sprint, and Aryeh Bourkoff of LionTree. Also Pat Esser of Cox Communications and Jeffrey Storey of CenturyLink. They’re doing an incredible job. If you look at other continents, if you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did and a much different route. We were talking about that just a little while ago, and they are having tremendous problems.  Other countries are having problems, other continents are having problems, but with business at a level that nobody’s seen it before on the internet, it’s holding up incredibly well. And they expect that to continue no matter what happened, and no matter how much more gains, which it can gain more than it already is, I don’t know because they’re setting records. Let me also update you on the distribution of urgency needed resources and supplies and we have a lot of numbers. I’m going to let Mike Pence speak to that in a little while, but we’re giving massive amounts of medical equipment and supplies to the 50 states. We also are holding back quite a bit. We have almost 10,000 ventilators that we have ready to go. We have to hold them back because the surge is coming, and it’s coming pretty strong, and we want to be able to immediately move it into place without going and taking it.  So we’re ready to go. And we’ve also distributed, I just spoke with governor of Michigan, had a great conversation and we sent a large number of ventilators to Michigan. We’re sending them to Louisiana. We sent additional ventilators to New York, additional ventilators to New Jersey. And I will say in New York, FEMA is supplying 250 ambulances and 500 EMTs to help respond to the increasing case load. That’s a lot of ambulances. In California, the Army Corps of engineers is developing eight facilities to expand hospital capacity up to 50,000 beds, 50,000. And had a great conversation last night with Gavin Newsom, he’s doing a really good job. We’re in constant communications. The USNS Mercy hospital ship is now operational. It’s in Los Angeles and receiving patients. And in New York, as you know, the Comfort, everybody watched that. It’s in place and it will be in a very short while receiving large numbers of patients over a thousand rooms and 12 operating rooms.  FEMA has also provided a hundred travel trailers to assist with housing needs and we’re ordering hundreds more. In Michigan, FEMA will soon deliver in addition to the ventilators, 250 bed, field, hospital, and Army Corps of engineers is evaluating locations to build alternate care facilities. So we’re doing a field hospital in Michigan of 250 beds and we may be doubling it up soon depending on the need. They’re doing a good job with beds in Michigan, but they may need more than the 250, so FEMA and the Army Corps of engineers are prepared to go there quickly and get it done. In Louisiana, we’re delivering two field hospitals to provide 500 new hospital beds. I’ve been talking with the governor, John Bel Edwards and the Army Corps of engineers has been really doing incredible work establishing 3000 alternate care site at the New Orleans Convention Center, which will be operational, believe it or not this week.  So we’re doing the 3000 bed alternate care site and we’re also doing a 500 bed new hospital, and that’s in Louisiana, which really got hit. It started off very late and it was looking good, and then all of a sudden it just reared up, came from nowhere. In addition to the supplies we’re delivering, we’re also giving hospitals the flexibility to use new facilities, including surgical care centers to care for hospital patients who are not infected. For example, I know that many expectant mothers are understandably concerned about exposing their newborn babies to the virus and they should be/ with our action yesterday, hospitals now have the authority to create special areas for mothers to deliver their babies in a very safe and healthy environment. Totally separate.  Over the past two months, the US State Department has organized one of the largest and most complex international evacuation operations in American history. Mike Pompeo is working around the clock along with Ambassador O’Brien. Since January 29th, we have successfully repatriated over 25,000 Americans from more than 50 countries where they were literally stuck. In some cases, locked in. And I salute the incredible public servants at the Department of State as well as their counterparts at DHS and HHS who have played such an important role in doing this. You probably read about the young people in Peru, and young people in Brazil, and they were absolutely stuck and we got them out. Almost everybody is out now back home with their parents, their wives, their husbands.  I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. We’re going to go through a very tough two weeks. And then hopefully as the experts are predicting, as I think a lot of us are predicting I after having studied it so hard, you’re going to start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel, but this is going to be a very painful, very, very painful two weeks. When you look and see at night the kind of death that’s been caused by this invisible enemy, it’s incredible. I was watching last night, Governor Murphy of New Jersey say 29 people died today, meaning yesterday, and others talking about numbers far greater, but you get to know a state, I know New Jersey so well. And you hit 29 people and hundreds in other locations, hundreds in other states. And this is going to be a rough two week period.  As a nation, we face a difficult few weeks as we approach that really important day when we’re going to see things get better all of a sudden. And it’s going to be like a burst of light. I really think and I hope that our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried, but America will answer with love and courage and ironclad resolve. This is the time for all Americans to come together and do our part. I appreciate a lot of the media. We’ve had a lot of really good things said. I think only good things can be said when you look at the job that’s been done. I just spoke with Franklin Graham who is an extraordinary person and a Samaritan’s Purse has been like so many others just been amazing and so fast. They did it so fast. He’s been doing that for a long time, but I think people are really seeing what they have done. Franklin Graham, very special family.  As we send plane loads of masks and gloves and supplies to the communities battling the plague, and that’s what it is. It’s a plague. We also send our prayers. We pray for the doctors and the nurses. For the paramedics and the truck drivers, and the police officers, and the sanitation workers. And above all, the people fighting for their lives in New York and all across our land. I watched as doctors and nurses one into a certain hospital in Elmhurst this morning. I know Elmhurst, Queens, I grew up right next to it. I know the hospital very well, been seeing it all my life, my young life.  And I will tell you that to see the scenes of trailers out there and what they’re doing with those trailers, they’re freezers and nobody could even believe it. And I spoke to some of my friends, they can’t believe what they’re seeing. And I watched the doctors and the nurses walking into that hospital this morning. It’s like military people going into battle, going into war. The bravery is incredible, and I just have to take my hat. I would take my hat if I were wearing a hat, I’d rip that hat off so fast and I would say “You people are just incredible.” They really are. They’re very brave. They’re going in and they don’t know, you have lots of things flying around in the air, you don’t know what you’re touching. Is it safe?  And you also see where your friends are going to the hospital and you say “How is he doing?” Two days later and they say, “Sir, he’s unconscious.” Or “He’s in a coma.” So things are happening that we’ve never seen before in this country. And with all of that being said, the country’s come together like I’ve never seen it before, and we will prevail, we will win, and hopefully it will be in a relatively short period of time. With that, I’d like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and show you some of the latest data that has been, I think brilliantly put together. And right after that I’m going to ask Dr. Fauci to speak, and Mike Pence is going to give you some of the recent events that have taken place and some of the statistics that we have that I think will be very interesting here. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Well, are they reasonably good? I guess we could say that, I’d like to have maybe Dr. Fauci or Deb come up and say, but I have numbers, but I’d rather have them say the numbers if you don’t mind. It’s a big question. But some of the cities are doing very well, as you see, very well at this early stage, but the number, the doctor said 100,000. All numbers between a 100,000 and 200,000 maybe even slightly more, but we would hope that we could keep it under. Well, I would, but you see, New York, I believe the blue is New York, New York is having a much harder time than other of the cities. Certain cities are doing… Actually, you look down here, an incredible job. They were early. They were very, very firm and they’ve done an incredible job. This is New Jersey, New York. This is… I think they’re doing very well with the  Yes. I can only say that we’re doing more than anybody in the world by far. We are testing highly accurate tests. These are tests that work, as you know, many tests are being sent to countries that are broken. Well, every day we get, and the word is exponential, we are getting more and more and more, and now we have the new tests that you saw yesterday. That’s going to be rolled out, I think, tomorrow or the next day, and that’s going to take only a few minutes, literally a few minutes to see the result and it’s a highly accurate result. I mean the tests were given out not by us, by other countries, where there was a 50/50 chance that it was wrong. What kind of a test is that? These are highly accurate tests, but the new tests that are coming out are very quick and they were just developed. Abbott Labs did the one yesterday. So we’re doing more than anybody in the world by far and they’re very accurate tests, and we’re getting a lot of information from those tests.  And they’re not being reported. And it’s up to the people if they don’t send them back. I mean, they use them. They don’t send a back. Doctor, go ahead, please. Well, it says- It says between 100 and 200,000. It says 100 to 200,000, anything, it’s a lot of people. Right? It’s a lot of people. Well, you didn’t ask the other question. What would have happened, because this is the question that I’ve been asking Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx for a long time, and they’ve been working on this for a long time. The question is what would have happened if we did nothing? Because there was a group that said let’s just ride it out. Let’s ride it out. What would have happened? And that number comes in at 1.5 to 1.6 million people, up to 2.2 and even beyond. So that’s 2.2 million people would’ve died if we did nothing. We just carried on our life. Now I don’t think that would’ve been possible because you would have had people dying all over the place. This would not have been a normal life. How many people have even seen anybody die? You would have seen people dying on airplanes. You would’ve been seeing people dying in hotel lobbies. You would have seen death all over.  So I think from a practical standpoint, that couldn’t have been carried out too far. But if you did nothing on the higher side, the number would be 2.2 and maybe even more, and on the lower side, 1.6 million people. Just to end the last topic , I think I can say this because I spoke to Dr. Birx before, and to Dr. Fauci, for whatever reason, New York got off to a very late start, and you see what happens when you get off to a late start. New Jersey got off, and I think both governors are doing an excellent job, but they got off to a very late start. When you look at Washington state, if you remember, that all started in a very confined nursing home, and you had 20 some odd people, I believe dying in one home. That doesn’t mean it escaped that home, and so they have a very different statistic than other states. But I mean, I remember it very vividly, the nursing home in Washington state, where you had many people dying every day, people were dying in the one exact location, so they were able to keep that relatively speaking into that location. They are very sobering. Yeah, when you see 100,000 people and that’s at a minimum number. Now what we’re looking at, and as many people as we’re talking about, whatever we can do under that number and substantially under that number, we’ve done that through really great mitigation. We’ve done that through a lot of a very dedicated American people. That 100,000 is, according to modeling, a very low number. In fact, when I first saw the number, and I asked this a while ago, they said it’s unlikely you’ll be able to attain that. I think we’re doing better than that. Now I think, we have to see, but I think we’re doing better than that because as John said, that would be a lot of lives taking place over a relatively short period of time. But think of what would have happened if we didn’t do anything.  I mean, I’ve had many friends, business people, people with great, actually common sense, they said, “Why don’t we ride it out?” A lot of people have said. A lot of people that thought about it, ride it out, don’t do anything, just ride it out, and think of it as the flu. But it’s not the flu. It’s vicious. When you send a friend to the hospital and you call up to find out how is he doing, it happened to me, where he goes to the hospital and he says goodbye, he’s sort of a tough guy, a little older, a little heavier than he’d like to be frankly, and you call up the next day, how’s he doing, and he’s in a coma. This is not the flu. So we would have seen things had we done nothing. But for a long while, a lot of people were asking that question, I think, right?  I was asking it also. I mean, a lot of people were saying, “Well, let’s just ride it out. This is not to be ridden out, because then you would’ve been looking potentially 2.2 million people or more, 2.2 million people in a relatively short period of time. If you remember, they were looking at that concept, it’s a concept I guess, you know it’s concept if you don’t mind death, a lot of death, but they were looking at that in the UK, remember? They were very much looking at it and all of a sudden they went hard the other way, because they started seeing things that weren’t good. So they put themselves in a little bit of a problem. Now, Boris tested positive and I hope he’s going to be fine, but in the UK, they were looking at that, and they have a name for it, but we won’t even go by the name. But it would have been, it would have been very catastrophic, I think, if that would’ve happened.  But that was something that everybody was talking about, Steve. Like, just don’t do anything, don’t do anything. Forget about everything. Just ride it out. They used the expression, ride it out. We would have had at a minimum 1.5, 1.6, but you would have had perhaps a more than 2.2 million people dying in a very short period of time. And that would have been a number that the likes of which we’ve never seen.  So now when we look at our package that we just approved for $2 trillion, all of a sudden it seems very reasonable. Right? When you’re talking about 2 million lives, all of a sudden it seems very reasonable. I must say, a lot of people that have been seeing the more advanced numbers, because these are much more advanced numbers now. You know when you first started, we didn’t know, and this was a different kind of a virus, and nobody knew that much about it, even the experts, you don’t really know where it’s going. But then they see what goes on in Italy, and they see what goes on in Spain, and you see France is having a very hard time, and other countries having a very, very hard time. But once they see what’s going on, they start making projections. So I hope they’re going to be very high projections. But based on everything else, that would be the number. Let’s see if we can do much better than that. I hope we can. Yeah, John. That’s right.  Well, it’s this way. You know, you can use a scarf. A lot of people have scarfs and you can use a scarf. Scarf would be very good, and my feeling is if people want to do it, there’s certainly no harm to it. I would say do it, but use a scarf if you want, rather than going out and getting a mask or whatever. We’re making millions and millions of masks, but we want them to go to the hospitals. I mean, one of the things that Dr. Fauci told me today is we don’t want them competing. We don’t want everybody competing with the hospitals where you really need them. So you can use scarfs. You can use something else over your face. It doesn’t have to be a mask, but it’s not a bad idea, at least for a period of time. I mean, eventually you’re not going to want to do that. You’re not going to have to do that. This is going to be gone. It’ll be gone, hopefully gone for a long time.  Please. Well, we’re going to find out. We hope it’s enough. We hope it’s enough. We hope we’re at a level where we could say, “Let’s go because our country wants to get back to work.” We really want to get back. Everybody wants to get back to work. Now, I could ask the doctors to answer that question, but we discus that all the time. What do you think? Well, I think we’ve been very harsh. I mean, you look at the streets. I looked at 5th Avenue today on camera, and I didn’t see anybody walking on the street, and I’m used to watching that street, you can’t see the asphalt, you can’t see the concrete, and you look and there’s nobody. There was one car. It looked like it might’ve been a taxi cab and it was in a time of the morning that there’d normally there’d be a lot of people. I mean, I think the mitigation has been very strong. Please. I didn’t do anything about tariff payments. I don’t know who’s talking about tariff payments. They keep talking about tariff payments and we haven’t done that. China’s paying us. We made a deal with China. Under the deal, they’re paying us 25% on $250 billion and they pay it. And I spoke with President Jinping the other day and we didn’t mention that. We had a great conversation, by the way, a really productive conversation having to do with many things. Most of it was on the virus, but you know, we’re not talking… Who are you with? Who are you with? Who are you with? Oh. Yeah, I know, it’s an incorrect report. Well, that might be, but I’m going to have to approve the plan , but one thing I will tell you, I approve everything and they haven’t presented it to me, so therefore it’s false reporting, so therefore don’t do the story. If we’re going to do something, I’d be glad to let you know. There’s nothing wrong with doing it, but, we’ll let you know. Yeah, please. A couple of back, then we’ll get back to you, John. Different kind of a state, also great Governor, knows exactly what he’s doing, has a very strong view on it, and we have spoken to Ron. Mike, you want to just to tell him a little bit about that. So, unless we see something obviously wrong, we’re going to let these governors good. Now, it’s obviously wrong, I mean, people can make things, they can make a decision that we think is so far out that it’s wrong, we will stop that. But in the case of-  So far out that it’s wrong, we will stop that. But in the case of Governor DeSantis, there’s two thoughts to it, and two very good thoughts to it, and he’s been doing a great job in every respect, so we’ll see what happens. But we only would exercise if we thought somebody was very obviously  Go ahead. Your turn. We did. We had a call that was probably about that, the oil prices, because as you know, Russia and Saudi Arabia are going at it, and they’re really going at it, and by going at it to the extent that they are, the oil has dropped to a point where, look, it’s the greatest tax cut we’ve ever given. If you look at it that way, because people are going to be paying 99 cents for a gallon of gasoline. It’s incredible. In a lot of ways, it’s going to help the airlines, but at the same time, it’s hurtful to one of our biggest industries. That’s the oil industry. It’s really, it’s not even feasible what’s going on. So I spoke to President Putin about that. I also spoke to the Crown Prince about that, Saudi Arabia. No, I think, yeah, they’re going to get together and we’re all going to get together, and we’re going to see what we can do. Because you don’t want to lose an industry. You’re going to lose an industry over it. 1000s and 1000s of jobs. I don’t know if you know. There’s oil all over the oceans right now. The boats are all filled. They’re renting ships. Ships that were dying, that weren’t doing well, and now that’s where they’re storing oil. And they’re sent out to sea, and they sit there for long periods of time. There’s so much oil. In some cases, it’s probably less valuable than water. In some parts of the world, water is much more valuable.  So we’ve never seen anything like it. But the two countries are discussing it, and I am joining at the appropriate time, if need be. We had a great talk with President Putin. We had a great talk with the Crown Prince. We also discussed, more so with President Putin in this case, the virus, because Russia’s being hit pretty hard. And we discussed many things. Trade. We discussed a lot of things with both. But in the case of both, we very much discussed the oil and the oil prices. I mean, you look, it’s $22, but it’s really much cheaper than that if you want to negotiate. Nobody’s seen that. That’s like from the 1950s. It really is. To think that it was 50, 60, 70, 80, and now it’s 22. But you know, if you put a good bid in at nine, I think you could probably get what you wanted, right?  John, please. Well, the problem with that one is they had maybe shovel ready jobs, maybe not, but they never used it for the purpose of infrastructure. So far, nobody has been able to find any money that was spent on infrastructure. I want to use it for infrastructure. And one of the reasons I’m suggesting it, John, is we’re paying zero interest. The United States is paying almost zero interest rate. The Federal Reserve lowered the rate, the fed rate. And that and a combination of the fact that everybody wants to be in the United States. You know, we have a dollar that’s very strong, and I know that sounds good, but it does make it hard to manufacture and sell outside, because other currencies are falling, and our currency is very strong. It’s very, very strong. Proportionately, it’s through the roof.  So we have a strong dollar. People want to invest in the United States, especially nowadays where they’re looking at safety. They have all of the problems, plus the virus at 151 countries. They all want to come into the United States. And so we have a zero interest rate, essentially. And I said, “Wouldn’t this be a great time to borrow money at zero interest rate and really build our infrastructure like we can do it?” So the plan was, the Republicans had a plan of about 750. I would say… They were where? At seven five? The Democrats were a little less than a trillion dollars. The Republicans were a little bit less than that.  And I’m suggesting $2 trillion. We redo our roads, our highways, our bridges. We fix up our tunnels, which are many of them in bad shape, like coming into New York, as you know, really bad shape. And we really do a job on our infrastructure, and that doesn’t mean we’re going to do the Green New Deal, because I won’t do it. I won’t approve it. We’re not going to do the Green New Deal and spend 40% of the money on things that people just have fun with. We’re going to borrow the money at zero percent interest, so our interest payments would be almost zero, and we can borrow long term. People want to be in the United States. They want to be invested in the United States. Go ahead, Jim. Right, that’s a good question. Actually, just the opposite, because we’re holding back. We have almost 10000. And we’re holding, because we’re going to need them over the next couple of weeks as the surge goes on. You see the chart. We haven’t hit the top yet. And we have to be able to move them immediately. And we can’t take them, because it’s going to be very hard to do that. We can’t take them to places that aren’t needing them. Plus we have requests for ventilators in hospitals and in states and cities that don’t need them, in our opinion. They don’t need them. They won’t need them  for flexibility. We just took 600, and we sent them to different locations today, but we have close to 10000, and we’ll be able to get them. And we’re all set to march. We have the National Guards, and we have FEMA, and we’re all set to move them to the places.  So as for your second question, what we’re going to do is save lives because of it, because otherwise, we would not be able to get to  and we don’t know what the hottest spot- In some areas we might, but we’ve done a great job with ventilators, and we’re having them made. Unbelievable, we have now 11 companies making ventilators. Now they’ll be starting to arrive in the next week, but we’ve also grabbed a lot of them. Some hospitals had more than they were saying, or at least more than we knew about, which is a good thing, not a bad thing. But we want to be able to have, I guess the word would be flexibility, so that if the surge turns out to be much stronger in Louisiana, which it could, that we can immediately bring 1000 or 2000 to Louisiana. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to get them. We wouldn’t be able to say, “Listen, Governor Cuomo in New York, we want to take ventilators away from New York.” And they’ll say, “Well, we can’t do that. It would be a disaster.” So we have great flexibility.  Now when this surge occurs, if it occurs fairly evenly, we’ll be able to distribute them very quickly before they need them. But we have a reserve right now. It’s like having oil reserves, except more valuable, frankly. But we have a reserve right now. And we’ll be able, and we also have a great team of people ready to deliver. They can move them fast. So when we see it going up in a certain state, and Louisiana could be one, and Michigan could be another with Detroit, because Detroit is having a lot of hard times right now. Detroit came out of nowhere, and that’s what happens with this. It comes out of nowhere.  So we are ready, Jim, depending on what happens. And we have a stockpile. And that’s why it’s called a stockpile. A lot of the ventilators and a lot of the other equipment, rather than sending it to the stockpile, we had it sent directly to a hospital, to a location, to a place, so we didn’t have the cumbersome nature of having it come in unboxed, put in and then deliver it. We have it brought, which they’d never done before. They don’t do that. Generally speaking, they don’t do that.  But we’ve had, I think, Mike, we’ve had tremendous success of doing that. That’s for other items, including ventilators, where it’s brought to the site that needs it. But we have a good supply of ventilators, and we’re ready to go. We’re all ready. We have trucks ready. We have everything ready, because as we’re saying, John, this could be a hell of a bad two weeks. This is going to be a very bad two and maybe even three weeks. This is going to be three weeks like we haven’t seen before. Well, I think the hospitals- Yeah. They are going to be facing a war zone. That’s what it is. I’ve heard some of the paramedics and some of the doctors. They said they’d been in war zones. They’ve never seen anything like this. You look at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. I’ve never seen. I mean, I look, I just think it’s so, because that’s a hospital that’s near where I grew up. And it is a war zone in a true sense. Yeah, please? They shouldn’t be doing that. If that happens, they should be calling us. Look, we have ventilators, but we’ve distributed 1000s of ventilators. But they shouldn’t be doing that. And if they need them that badly, we know. We have pretty good ideas of where they’re going to need them. Some people, frankly, think they need them, and they don’t need them. I don’t want to mention names, but there are some people that want them, and it’s really not the right thing. Then you have some people that I guess automatically hoard a little bit. They want to have more than they think they need. But a ventilator is a very precious piece of equipment right now. It’s hard to make. It takes a long time to make it. It’s complex. Some of them are like the dashboard of an airplane. I mean, they’re very complicated and very expensive machines, and some are much simpler. But we’re ready to go depending on what happens.  But we have some hospitals in some states that think they need ventilators, and we don’t think they do. Now if they do need them, we will have them there before they need them. We’ll be able to move very quickly. Nothing that I’ve heard. I mean, that’s the first question I make every morning. I tell you, I call up, you know we have 1100. 1100 in New York right now, and we have other locations where patients, people are taking them. Now the good news is it’s only three days, and it’s like a seven or eight day treatment. The good news is we haven’t heard anything bad. In other words, there have been no catastrophic events. But we haven’t. It’s a little bit too soon to talk about it. It would be a total game changer, John, if that happened. If that happened, it would be a game changer. And we include that in that, and I think in all cases the Z-Pak, you know what the Z-Pak is. So we’re going to see what happens with the Hydroxychloroquine.   Yeah. Just one second. Steve? We’re looking at a lot of them. We’re looking at a lot of them. Some show promise. I think maybe the doctor might want to speak about the vaccines, because a lot of Johnson & Johnson is advanced, very advanced. We’ll see what happens. The one thing with the vaccine is it doesn’t help this group, because this group, you need to test a vaccine. The one thing with the drug you just mentioned, right, is that it’s been out. It’s a malaria drug and also an arthritis drug. So it’s been out there for a long time. Very powerful drug. But it’s been out there for a long time. So it’s tested in the sense that you know it doesn’t kill you, but you may want to discuss the vaccines for a second, Dr. Fauci. And I have to sit in this. Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin, which is, you take it with it, maybe, if you want, for the infection. I think some medical workers are doing that. Using it, maybe, or getting it prescribed perhaps for another use. But the word is that some are, and some aren’t. I mean, I think it’s not a bad idea to do it, but that’s up to the doctors. But there is a theory going around that in our country and some other countries, people are taking, that work in the hospitals, that work with the patients, because there is some evidence, and again, it’s going to have to be proven. It’s very early. We’re rushing this stuff through. This was supposed to take a long time to be approved, and I prevailed upon the FDA to get it approved immediately on the basis that it was already in the market for a lot of years for another use, malaria mostly. And arthritis, but mostly malaria.  So we’ll see what happens. But there is a theory out there that for the medical worker, Doctor, it may work. It may work. And if you take it, it’s been out there for a long time. Please, go ahead. About which? Well, it’s not empty. Let me explain something. What we’re doing, I thought I said it accurately. I certainly meant to. Rather than having it brought into the stockpile, where appropriate, other than certain things, like we have quite a few of the ventilators, which is not a lot when you look at the whole country, actually. It sounds like a lot, almost 10000, but we’re trying to have supply sent directly to the states, because we save a big state. We don’t want medical supplies coming in to warehouses all over the place, and then we take them from there and bring them to another warehouse. So we’re having it brought ideally from the manufacturer directly to the hospital or the state where it’s going.  So we’re trying to keep it that way as much as possible. Now in some cases we are having it brought. Remember this. We also took over a virtually empty, and I say it again, just like we had no ammunition in the military, and we had virtually no ammunition. Well, we had very little in medical supplies, too, in our stockpile. So for the most part, we’re trying very hard to have it delivered to the site where they need it. Yeah. Please go ahead. I’m going to let the military make that decision. Well, we’re going to see all about that. Don’t worry about our military. You saw the military put up a hospital in three and a half days with 2900 beds, with a lot of beds. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And by the way, that wasn’t the only one. It wasn’t just the Javits Center. It was at other locations. And now it’s Louisiana, and now it’s New Jersey, and now it’s other places. One thing that I think is indisputable is when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA working with them, but when I watched the Army Corps of Engineers throw up these hospitals, and they’re complex. I mean, these are incredible buildings, essentially. Tents and various things, but they did it in such a quick, such a short period of time.  And our military is ready like you haven’t seen, and you know who are the best? The best guests are the different shows are, we watch the shows at night. And I think the best guests that I’ve seen in a long time are the military people. And they’ve never done it before. I’ve watched General Semonite, who I deal with a lot. I say, “General, you got to give us two new hospitals in Louisiana.” “Yes sir.” And the next morning, they’re building them at 6:00 in the morning, and they’re up in three days. I think they’re the best. The best guest you have. I guess I’m tired of the other guests, in all fairness. Jim, go ahead. Well, I’m going to let them answer that. Yeah? Yeah, I’m going to let them answer the question, but remember this. And again, I say it and everybody says it. You know who says it better than anybody is Dr. Fauci. I had a decision to make. Maybe it was my biggest decision. China was heavily infected, and 1000s and 1000s of people were coming from China to the United States. And against the wishes, not even wishes, but they disagreed with the decision. I made a decision to stop China from coming in. Took a lot of heat, even from China. They weren’t exactly happy. I just made a trade deal, a big one, $250 billion trade deal. And I’m shortly thereafter saying, “You can’t come into our country.”  That was a big decision. That was earlier than the date you’re talking about. So that was a big decision. That was probably, and by the way, not because I did it, that was probably the biggest decision we made so far. But if you look at the one graph, the problem New York has is New York started late, but the other ones didn’t start so late. Now New York is also more complicated, because for obvious reasons, but it got a late start. But do you maybe want to answer those questions? We would have known the same thing. We inherited . I do believe we were very early, but I also think that we were very smart, because we stopped China. We had never done that before. You know, we had never closed our borders before, as I read. I read. I don’t know, maybe that’s not right. And Dr. Fauci had also said that was, I think it was maybe the biggest moment, because we were stopping the source. We were stopping the infection. But we also stopped Europe very shortly thereafter. That was a big decision. That was not an easy decision either. I stopped them a long time before people started stopping anywhere. So we stopped China, we stopped Europe, we stopped all of Europe. And then ultimately we stopped UK, Ireland. Yes?  In the back there, please. Sure, please. Yeah please, go ahead. You’re talking about the chloroquine? Is that what you’re talking about? In specifically the last question? There are trials going on, but there are also trials going on, we’re trying them on people that are now sick. That’s a very important trial. We’re watching whatever happens around the world. We’re watching those trials very closely.  Mitch? Well, I don’t like to think I did. I think I handled it very well, but I guess it probably did. I mean, I got impeached. I think I certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it. Right? But think of it. It was a hoax. It was a total hoax. And when you think that I got impeached only because they had a majority in the House. They didn’t get one Republican vote. 196 to nothing. Not one Republican. I don’t think it’s ever happened. The Republicans stuck together, and they stuck together in the Senate. 52 to a half. A half. So when you say that, yeah, I think it took a lot of, I see them going and saying about speed. Well, they probably illegally impeached me in the sense that if you look at the FBI today with what happened, the horrible things, nobody cares about that now, because all they’re thinking about is the virus. And that’s okay with me.  But you look at the report that came out from IG Horowitz, it’s disgraceful what went on. It’s disgraceful. It’s a total disgrace. They got caught in the act, but you know what? We won’t talk about that now. Did it divert my attention? I think I’m getting A pluses for the way I handled myself during a phony impeachment. Okay? It was a hoax. But certainly, I guess I thought of it. And I think I probably acted. I don’t think I would have done any better had I not been impeached. Okay? And I think that’s a great tribute to something. Maybe it’s a tribute to me. But I don’t think I would have acted any differently, or I don’t think I would have acted any faster.  But the Democrats, their whole life, their whole being, their whole existence was to try and get me out of office any way they can. Even if it was a phony deal. And it was a phony deal. And it turned out, and all you have to do is look today at the FBI reports. Take a look at what the FBI did. Take a look at the people. Take a look at Comey’s report. Seven and eight pages of total kill. Take a look at that. Take a look at the reporter, McCabe. Just read it. And you’ll see how horrible it was. And you know what? I don’t think this country is going to take it. You want to know the truth.  Yeah, well, I’ll be speaking. I’m going to be speaking. In fact, he has a call in to me. We’ll be speaking to the governor, and we’ll be speaking to him soon. But there’s a case. We have two ships. There are people that are sick on the ship, and we don’t want to be like they’re going to be ghost ships. You know, people turn those ships away. There was a ship, as you know, in a certain part of Asia and from port to port, nobody would take it. But in the meantime, you have people that are dying on the ship or at least very sick, but they’re dying on the ship. So I’m going to do what’s right, not only for us but for humanity. I mean, these are two big ships, and they have a lot of very sick people. I’ll be speaking to the governor. Let’s do just a couple more back here.  Go ahead, please. Do you ever run out of questions, you people? It’s the most unbelievable thing. You go through the room with me. But I have nothing else to do. So if you want us. I mean, if you want. Should we keep it going, John? I think so. Let’s go. You mean he was complaining? Say it. What did he say exactly? What did he say? Well, he shouldn’t be complaining because we gave him a lot of ventilators. And if you take a look at the chart, it’s down. But I wish he got going a little bit sooner. But we gave him a lot of ventilators, and you know what? He has a lot of ventilators. The problem is with some people, no matter what you give, it’s never enough. It’s never enough. Like they’ll say, ” How’s Trump doing?” And you’re a Democrat. Some of them said, “Really good.” I’ll tell you, Gavin Newsom from California, who’s doing a good job by the way, and others said, “Really good.” But generally your natural reflex. “How’s Trump doing?” You ask that question to a Democrat. “Well, we don’t like it.” Oh really? You don’t like it? We’re getting very high marks, but I’m not doing this for marks. I’m doing this to save lives. When John acted, wait. When John saw the numbers and when Jim saw those numbers, they’re shocking numbers. You know, you’re talking about deaths.  Even at the low end, you were shocked. When you see 100 and 120000 and 200000 people over potentially a very short period of time, I want to save lives. I’m not doing this for any other reason. I want to save lives. But the governor of New York’s gotten, I think maybe, probably, has more than anybody has gotten. Four hospitals. He’s gotten four medical tents. He’s gotten a ship the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before other, than Los Angeles, which has the twin. I mean, we’ve done a lot, but many ventilators were sent to New York.  And Mayor de Blasio. I’m getting along with Mayor de Blasio great. And I think he’s very happy with the job we’re doing, too. We’re sending a lot of, actually Mayor de Blasio had an interesting request. He wanted people. And we’re sending medical people. A lot of people, a lot of the states, aren’t having a problem with ventilators. They’re having a problem getting medical people, and we’re sending a lot of people in. Military-  … And we’re sending a lot of people in, military, very talented people. Who ? Go ahead and then I’ll do you second. They shouldn’t be doing what? They shouldn’t be competing and they should call us. Wait, no, I don’t want them to compete because all they’re going to do is drive up the price. I don’t want them to compete. They should be calling us and we can work it so they get the ventilators and they get shipped directly. If they’re competing, if they’re calling, even if there’s only two of them calling, they’re going to just drive up the price. Because as nice as some of the people that do ventilators, they do want to make money. Okay? Now, you don’t get a chance to buy 16,000 ventilators, I guess they didn’t take that option. That was in 2016, and that’s a hard option to take because it’s a lot of money and who would ever think you need 16,000 ventilators? Who would ever think it? But this a very unique time in life. And I think I’m dealing with New York and we’re having a very good relationship and you see what just happened in Central Park with the tents. I mean, we’re having a really good relationship. Go ahead. You didn’t get. Yes. They’ve done a good job, California. Now let’s see what happens. Because we could have a spike doctors. I mean, you don’t know. They could have a spike where all of a sudden it spikes upward. We had a couple of like a Louisiana, I think they’re doing a really good job, but they had nothing. Now they had Mardi Gras and then all of a sudden after Mardi Gras, which tells you about distancing, I guess. I mean, it’s an example of what could happen, but they were like flawless. I was always surprised. I was looking at Louisiana and I understand that state. I love that state, and I’m saying they’re in great shape. Then they have Monte Gras was a big success, tremendous success, and then all of a sudden it went like a rocket ship. So that tells you about distancing. Please. Say it again, a little louder. Yeah, there is. Well, they’re looking at that very strongly and I know that it’s bothers Gavin. I don’t know if it bothers Nancy Pelosi, but she’s got it in her district at a very high level. They have to be very careful. They have a very big homeless population in an area which just a few years ago didn’t have anybody in those areas, and they’re living in the streets and they’re … I know that some people in California are working on that very hard. We’re talking about something that will be very positive for the world if we do it, we’ll see if we do it or not. Well, I don’t want to talk … It’s a private thing, but it will become public if we decide to do it, but positive. Our relationship with the president, our relationship with France is I think extraordinary. Very good. Probably as good as it’s ever been. Well, it is. It’s going to go away. Hopefully at the end of the month and if not it hopefully will be soon after that. It is going away. I think from the beginning, my attitude was that we have to give this country … I knew how bad it was. All you have to do is look at what was going on in China. It was devastation. Well, yeah, look at the numbers from China, those initial numbers coming out from China. But I read an article today which was very interesting. They say, “We wish president Trump would give more bad news.” Give bad news. I’m not about bad news. I want to give people hope. I want to give people a feeling that we all have a chance. I mean, when you saw the numbers and when John and all of you saw those numbers and you were saying 120,000 people, you mean that’s good? 100,000 dead people within a short period of time. I want to give people a feeling of hope. I could be very negative. I could say, “Wait a minute. Those numbers are terrible. This is going to be horrible.” This is a horrible thing. Hey Jim- Well, there were a lot of people that could have said that, we didn’t say that. Fortunately I didn’t say that and that was an alternative. We talked about it. That was always an alternative. That’s what I said, “Let it rip, let it ride, do nothing.” And we could have had 2.2 million dead people more than that because I didn’t do that. And we did catch it early and we stopped China really early and we stopped Europe really early because I saw what was happening … What happened is I stopped Italy because Italy was really heavily infected. We started off with certain parts of Italy, then all of Italy. Then we stopped Spain, then I said stop Europe, let’s stop Europe. We have to stop them from coming here. Europe, I love Europe, but they were having problems. I don’t think anybody did a better job than that. Especially when you see the 2.2 million number, and I hope we’re going to be substantially under the numbers that you’re looking at on the minimum side. Then I think we will have, hey look, it’s still tremendous death- I want to be positive. I don’t want to be negative. I have to … I’m a positive person. Somebody said, “Oh, I wish you’d be more negative.” They literally have that. It’s in one of the wonderful newspapers today. I wish you’d be more negative. Well, this is really easy to be negative about, but I want to give people hope too. I’m a cheerleader for the country. We’re going through the worst thing that the country’s probably ever seen. Look, we had The Civil War, we lost 600,000 people. Right? Here’s the thing, had we not done anything, we would have lost many times that, but we did something and so it’s going to be hopefully way under that, but we lose more here potentially than you lose in world wars as a country. So there’s nothing positive, there’s nothing great about it, but I want to give people in this country hope. I think it’s very important. I knew everything. I knew it could be horrible and I knew it could be maybe good. Don’t forget, at that time people didn’t know that much about it. Even the experts, we were talking about it. We didn’t know where it was going. We saw China, but that was it. Maybe it would have stopped at China. We wished we could have killed it in China, but it didn’t happen. It started spreading to Europe. It started spreading here. It started spreading all over, but … And I’m not blaming anybody, I’m just saying that we have an incredible thing. I think the people, our professionals, our military, our governors, our politicians, I think they’ve done an incredible job. With few exceptions, I think they’ve done an incredible job.  But I don’t want to be a negative person. It’d be so much easier for me to come up and say, “We have bad news. We’re going to lose 220,000 people and it’s going to happen over the next few weeks.” And with that, I did start off by saying today, long before this question, I said, “This is going to be a rough two or three weeks.” This is going to be one of the roughest two or three weeks we’ve ever had in our country. We’re going to lose thousands of people.  When I see 28, 29 people from the governor of New Jersey, 29 people, when you see 173 people died in New York yesterday or whatever the number was, I think it was more than that. When you see the kind of numbers that we’re witnessing, we’ve never seen numbers like that. So it’s easy to be negative and then everybody could be negative. But I’m a cheerleader for our country, and I want to do a great job so the number can be kept … And I’ve always said it. I want as few a number of people to die as possible and that’s all we’re working on. I don’t mind the question. I think it’s actually … I think it’s … It’s not meant to be. Look, I know you well enough, so it’s not meant to be a fair question, but it is a fair question. I think we’ve done a fantastic job. Okay, fine. I’ll, I’ll accept your word. Look, Jim. I think we’ve done a great job. We’re going to see how it comes out, but when you look at minimal numbers of 120,000 people, when you look at, it could have been 2.2 Million people died and more if we did nothing.  If we just did nothing, would’ve gone up and would it come down as per your statement, it would have been confined. It would have been a similar time, maybe even less time. It would have been violence like we’ve never seen in this country before. We had great professionals, great military, really great governors and politicians. I cannot say enough about what’s going on. And as per what you said, I think we’re way ahead of schedule in terms of numbers, I think, I hope. But if we can keep it under the minimum numbers, the country has … Not me, the country has done a great job, but I think I’ve done a really good job of mobilizing. I think Mike Pence has been fantastic. I put him in charge of the task force. We have wonderful people on the task force, Jim, wonderful people. This man was working, literally, he had days where he didn’t go to bed, he didn’t go to sleep. He called … He went 24 hours and then started the next day.  People don’t know the job he did. I didn’t even know he was that good of a manager to be honest with you, Mike. Okay? And you never know that about somebody until they’re tested under fire. But he saw it very early also. We both did. They saw it very early. They knew pretty soon. They probably knew sooner than anybody because that’s what they study. That’s what they do. Must be a depressing business, right? Let’s do a little bit depressing, but they’ve seen it all. Go ahead John. Do you want to keep going? Go ahead, over there. Yes. I never say that, but Franklin Graham is somebody that’s very special. I have many very special people and a very many special in the evangelical, evangelical Christian community. You could talk rabbis, you can talk a lot of … I have tremendous support from religious leaders and Franklin Graham, I just spoke to him today for an extended period of time. I told him what a fantastic job you’re doing, and he does this. He loves doing it. He loves helping people, and he loves Jesus. Then I can tell you. He loves Jesus. He’s a great gentleman. Go ahead. On what? And just about masks. You can get a mask, but you can also do … I mean most people have scarves and scarves are very good and they can use a scarf and where are we talking about a limited period of time. And it says in the recommendations you can use … You can substitute a scarf for a mask. So if people feel that … And I think some people disagree with the mask for various reasons and some people don’t. But you can wear a scarf, you can do the masks if it makes you feel better. We have no objection to it and some people recommend it. Let’s go. You people never get tired. Thank you. There’s still good questions. You mean you people? You mean you people? I mean, you’re pretty spread out already. I don’t have anymore … I don’t think we’ll have press conferences anymore, but- Look, we’re very careful. I’m very careful personally, and- We are looking at numerous countries as they get in a position. Brazil as an example, you mentioned the president. Brazil had no problem until just a short time ago and now they’re starting to get inflamed and yes, we are absolutely looking at a ban. There are two other countries you mentioned, Iran already has a band. They had sort of an automatic ban. In addition to that, they have a band. So we’re looking at certain countries as they become hot. I wanted to go to the opening of the hospital in New York, and my people couldn’t even believe it that I said it, but I did. I wanted to go. They didn’t want me to do it. The Secret Service didn’t want me to do it for reasons I wanted to go to the boat sailing into New York Harbor. But the governor did a good job of that, and the mayor of New York. So I love to go out but not be in the white house and it’s sort of like nerve center, control center and I think it’s important. Look, you see what happened with Boris Johnson, you see what happened with others. I think it’s important that I remain healthy. I really do. So for the most part we’re staying here. I’ve canceled many different events and we’ll be staying here, for the most part. We have it. And I have to say this, I’ve had, in the last less than a week, three governors call up that truly have disliked me over the years. Even before I decided to run for president and they said, “I have to tell you, you’ve done a great job. You and your team have done a great job.” These are three governors respected, very respected in two cases and they said, “Like or not like, you and your team have done an incredible job.” And I think they have, I think they’ve done an incredible job. Go ahead, please. I just want to add, I think the one thing nobody really knew about this virus was how contagious it was. It’s so incredibly contagious, and nobody knew that. This is like a … I don’t know that anybody’s ever seen anything like this. Normally you’d have to get close and touch and this. A lot of things have to happen. This is just like … It’s truly invisible and so contagious and I don’t think any doctor knew it at the time. I don’t think anybody could have known it. People have not seen anything like this. Essentially we do. We’ve distributed thousands of ventilators and we have now thousands of ventilators and we’re buying them at a good price and we’re actually making them by the thousands. We’re making them. You saw yesterday where Ford is going to have a tremendous number, they’re looking to make 100,000 ventilators. Ford has been great. General Electric healthcare has been great. General Motors has come a long way. I have to be honest. They are working very hard. We’re making thousands and thousands of ventilators. At the end of this, and there will be, don’t say I’m optimistic, because I don’t want to … I wouldn’t want to do that, but I am optimistic. I’m a very optimistic person. Let me tell you, we will have thousands of ventilators, and what I want to do is make sure that we always have plenty for the future, but then we want to help Italy and France and other countries that you don’t even know about yet with all of the problems they have, because ventilators are very tough to come by. They’re very hard to make, they’re very complicated, they’re very expensive. Yeah, please. You can go ahead. Go ahead. I can’t take your interpretation of what he said, I don’t know what he said. I think he’s been reasonably generous considering he’s a Democrat and I think he’d like to run for president. So I think he’s been pretty generous under those circumstances, but he’s been very generous to me. Look, I got them ships, I got them hospitals, I got them a lot of things that he never thought …. He hit pay dirt, okay? And I’ve been very generous on ventilators. If you look, they had 2,000 and 4,000 they had thousands of ventilators in his warehouse, in their warehouse waiting to be picked up. They never picked them up. So I’d have to hear it from him face to face. And how about one more and we’ll see you tomorrow. Is that okay? Don’t say got to cut it short- That’s right, it could be  tomorrow, but you know what? In the meantime, I’m sure people are enjoying it. Now, I will say this, it’s an incredibly dark topic and incredibly horrible topic and it’s incredibly interesting. That’s why everybody is … They’re going crazy. They can’t get enough of it and they want to be careful and I guess they’re studying it for themselves. Just studying if they get it. A lot of people have it. A lot of people are positive and they hope for the best, because when this gets the wrong person, meaning a person that qualifies, generally speaking, under the list, it is ravaging. It is horrible. Go ahead. How about you, in the back? If we do see a second wave, because I’ve heard Dr. Fauci answer this question. If we do we’re going to be, I think, very well-prepared, and the second wave won’t be like the first wave, and with that I better let him give you a little bit more to that answer because I don’t want to have him upset with me and say, “I wish you would have answered that question.” Come on doctor. A lot of very positive things are happening with the therapeutics and drugs of different kinds and the vaccines. I think a lot of very positive things are happening. Okay, one more. Please. I will say Mike Pence, myself, the head of FEMA, some of our generals that are working that are doing an unbeliever, we have generals that are working that are unbelievable talents, unbelievable leaders, and it’ll go through one of three or four people if it comes down to that. And I hope it doesn’t come down to that, because I think we’re very well-equipped, and it’s an honor to be here tonight. I appreciate it. I appreciate your interest. I think there is a great interest in it, and we’ll see you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow. ."
"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. So America continues to wage all out war to defeat the virus, this horrible, horrible virus. You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday. And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread for 30 days. Together we have the power to save countless lives. We’re attacking the virus in every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early, far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else. In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory. As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other maligned actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. And we must not let that happen. We will never let that happen.  Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter narcotics operations in the Western hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics. We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives. In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace. We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft and helicopters, Coast Guard cutters and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region. Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy. Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details. In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who’s done an incredible job so many ways, say a few words and also with us our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know, I think you know and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz.  So I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go and after that we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this and then we’ll go on to phase two, which is the virus itself. Okay, thank you, please, Mark. Thank you General, thank you. So do we have any questions on this? Because this group is going to go back to work, they’re going to leave. Well, for a long time we’ve had a lot of drugs coming into our country and it’s not that it’s increased, we’ve probably got it down a little bit, but it’s still a tremendous number of families are being ruined, lives are being ruined. It’s an incredible thing, especially as you’re at this position, you would never believe it. I see things that nobody would believe. I see reports that nobody would believe. So I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, what do you think we can do? And they think they can interdict, they that think we can stop it before it gets to the shores and they’re coming from all over the place and we have incredibly talented people. So I think I’m going to let Mark just give him a little bit of an answer to that. But we just want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country.  didn’t do it for this reason, but it’ll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in, so not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena. And that’s at least for the next hopefully short period of time, the virus, so we’ll be able to have an impact on that too. Please. Well, because we’re focused on so many other parts of the country and even parts of the world. And all of a sudden, areas where we had it clamped down pretty tight, in all fairness, the wall is up to about 160 miles already. And any areas where we have that wall, it’s for the most part contiguous, we have fill-ins but we’re up to 161 miles exactly. And any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it’s stopping everybody cold. I mean, we’re stopping … Nobody’s seen anything like it, that’s how good it works. And the other side knew had worked that well. Everybody, because everybody was for it five years ago, all of a sudden they changed.  It’s having a tremendous impact. But we are now focused on so many different things because of what’s happened, because of this horrible, I say it’s a horrible phenomena that now we’ve got to focus on drugs and the drugs come in from different methods and we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world. So we’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs. But one of the other things, we’ll also have an impact we think on the virus. Yeah, please. We really don’t know, how do we know whether they under reported or reported however they report. But we had a great call the other night. We’re working together on a lot of different things including trade. They’re buying a lot, they’re spending a lot of money and they’re giving it to our farmers. They’re paying our farmers for the product. So we’re going to continue that along. John, yeah. I know what you’re saying, but we just have information that they were planning something and it’s very good information. It was led by Iran, not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran, but that to me is Iran. And we’re just saying, don’t do it, don’t do it, it would be a very bad thing for them if they did it. I had a very powerful response by the way, that response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people. Well, that was a very big response, we knocked out a lot. We looked at … they had one side, we hit five big ones and ammunition sites. You saw what happened, and I won’t say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed and a lot of them. That was a big response. But this response will be bigger, if they do something. Yeah and you had one, please. We have not received that, but their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side and I’m being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported. But we discussed that with him, not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they’re doing. And we’re in constant communication with the … I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi. The relationship’s very good. Look, they will be spending when things even out, this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle what’s happened over the last month, but they’ll be spending $250 billion buying our product. $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things. They never did that before. So we have a great trade deal and we’d like to keep it. They’d like to keep it and the relationship is good. As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I’m not an accountant from China. No, because people just don’t know. People don’t know. Where did it come from? I think we all understand where it came from and President Xi understands that and we don’t have to make a big deal out of it. We didn’t like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers and they haven’t pursued that. And that a mid-level person said that, that was not a high level person. So I will always assume the best. I’ll assume the high level people didn’t know about it. It was a foolish statement. So look, the relationship with China is a good one and my relationship with him is really good. Please. Oh, I don’t mind if they want … Yeah, I feel that is a positive if they’re helping other countries. We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus, under siege. Some are doing really badly, they don’t know about social distancing. These are countries that aren’t highly sophisticated. They don’t have great communication to the rest of the world. I mean, they don’t know the things that we’re doing and that some others are able to do. And if China can help them, I’m all for it. I’m for all of us helping everybody. We’re soon going to have more ventilators than we need. We’re building thousands of ventilators right now. Now, it takes a period of time to build them. And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen. We’re building thousands. We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use. Even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn’t happen. We’re going to be distributed them, the extras around the world. We’ll go to Italy, we’ll go to France, we’ll go to Spain, which is very hard hit. No, no truth whatsoever. I would love China and other countries if they have additional supplies, medical supplies to give to other countries. 151, why would I stop that? Wouldn’t it be terrible to stop it? Whatever we have, whatever we’ve committed to, we commit, but we also need a lot for ourselves, so we’re very focused on that until we get over this. So obviously, we’re not going to be shipping too much until now. We do have excess of certain things and we don’t have enough of others. I just had a great talk today with Doug McMillan from Walmart and I gave him a very, very big order for gowns, for protective gear, for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything. And he’s actually very excited about it. He’s the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing. I mean of anything probably in the world. And he is very excited about it. And he said, what size? I said, it’s almost an unlimited.  When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, how could they possibly use so much, whether it’s masks or the protective gear. But we are supplying a tremendous amount and we just ordered a lot from Walmart. And he’s taken this on personally. And I said, let it be shipped not to a warehouse directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of-  Play to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of time when we do that. So Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level. Please. I don’t think we’re losing ground, but we don’t want to lose ground. That’s why we’re doing it. I don’t want to lose ground. It’s a big fight. I’ve seen many families where they’re wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a wife or whatever. Or all of them and we don’t want to lose ground and we are heavily focused on the virus, very heavily focused. After this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now. And remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot. Really helps us a lot. Yeah, please. Many of the governments are, and Mexico in particular is. In Mexico right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border keeping people out of our country and very few people are coming into our country right now and as we complete, again the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it’s a very tough place to come into.  When I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted. They were bringing drugs of any type and now, it’s very hard for them. And it will get harder and harder. But the president of Mexico is a great guy who has really helped us a lot. 27,000 Mexican soldiers. And you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans. They were marching through Mexico. That’s not happening anymore. Please, in the back? I cannot tell you. I know the answer to that, I believe I do, but I cannot tell you that. We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully. But I cannot tell you the answer to that. Yeah, please?  Sure. They’re taking precautions and we are watching it very closely and if something bad happens, it’s going to be very painful for the other side. They know about it. Yeah. They know. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens, but we’re down to a small force now over the years. Since I got, we’ve been bringing smaller and smaller, and we’re down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful air power there. We have the big base. I mean, nobody can get near it. Nobody can even get near that. But we’ve really largely left, we’ve taken tremendous amounts out and we’ve deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home. It’s social media, it gets out. I have hundreds of millions of people, number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I just found out I’m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means. It represents something and when I can explain to people just don’t do it. It’s going to be bad if you do, it’s going to be really bad and they don’t need to do it, they have enough problems. Iran has enough problems without doing that. But we’ve been pulling back very substantially over the last year in Iraq. And so, that’s the way it is. No, I’m just giving them a warning, it’s not a heads up. I’m giving them a warning. There’s a big difference. I’m saying if you do anything to hurt our troops, they’re going to pay a price. Now, as per the question, they did last time. We didn’t make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive major ammunition sites and a lot of people went with it. A lot of bad people. A lot of enemy went with it and we didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price. They’ll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything. Sure. Not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore. Right? I think we- We probably have decided on that. Thank you. No, military people, on ships. It is because we’re sending directly to hospitals. We don’t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals. One of the things, and again, we asked the states to do this as much as possible, many of the states have people that, whether it’s that or clothing, they make clothing, lots of clothing in many of the different states. We said, “See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers, make a deal, we’ll use the purchase act if we have to on them, if they won’t.” By the way, so many people are… The spirit is incredible, what they’re doing, but we’ve asked States where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals. We’re shipping things right in.  We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility. It’s a lot. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not because as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves, it moves very fast and we don’t know yet whether we’re going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, wherever it may be. So we’re ready for it. We’re totally ready for it. We’re going to be shipping out, we’ve already agreed to ship out over a thousand today to different sites, different locations, but we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where the virus is going. And we’ll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance. So right now, we have a nice pile of ventilators.  We have a lot more coming in. I think we have 11 companies making ventilators right now. Very good companies and they’re making them. You know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now. So, now the question is, when you make one, it doesn’t get made in 15 minutes. A mask can go quickly, a ventilator takes time to build. It’s very, very, as we discussed, it’s complex, it’s big, gets expensive, et cetera. But we’ll be able to move. We have great flexibility. John? Yeah, I think if… Does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people? Yes, please? We’re looking at doing two additional brand new hospital ships because these ships have really struck a blow, a very positive blow for what they’re doing. Going into Los Angeles, going into New York. So, we’re looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size. Well, building but we’re looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship. But this has really worked out well. So probably two brand new ones.   Is this concerning the gentleman or do you want them… You don’t want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people? Yeah, it can move very quickly. He’s a very capable man. We’re ready to move very quickly. As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we’re looking to move very quickly. If we need them. Hopefully we won’t need them. We’re going to find out pretty soon. We’re only going to know at the time it happens. We prepare for the worst. We are preparing for the worst. Unfortunately, that’s the way we have to look at it. Well, as I understand, they’re not doing that on the ship. That’s the one thing they’re not doing outside of the COVID-19. They’re not doing that. The birth of a baby not being done on the ships. One more for this group right here, please. And I happen to think they want to make a deal. They just don’t know really how to start and they’ve been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry. It’s a very bad advice and I really think they want to make a deal, which is the Logan act, but we’d have to look at the Logan act. All you have to do is take a look. I think they’ve been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry. I think they’re dying to make a deal. Look, their country’s in trouble. Their economics are shot. They’ve got a lot of bad things going. I think they’d like to make a deal. They can get it settled very quickly. No nuclear weapons. They can’t have nuclear weapons. It’s very simple. Okay, let’s let these folks get back to work. Is that okay? Thank you all very much.  So as we deploy our service members to combat both threats abroad, invisible enemy at home, earlier today I spoke to our nation’s incredible warriors and military families. Spent a long time of the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in. In order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station and in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home the heroes from deployment. There’s a tremendous burden to bear and the families have been involved with us for so long and they are incredible. Without the families, they couldn’t be the great service members that they turned out to be. And they understand that. And I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority.  So, they understand what’s happening with respect to the virus and they understand it well. They’ve been fantastic. As commander in chief, I’m deeply grateful for our service members, their spouses and their children, whose love, devotion and sacrifice keeps America strong. To make, procure and deliver a crucial medical supplies to our doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, my administration is leveraging the might of American manufacturing supply chains and innovators across the industry and across every industry and I just told you about Walmart and I could tell you about many more. Hanes is making protective gear and masks and we’re making tremendous amounts of product.  There’s never been anything like it. At the same time, I tell the governors, get it yourself if you can from your local companies and your local warehouses and factories. If you can do that, you should do that. Because of the actions that we’ve taken under the Defense Production Act, manufacturers and suppliers are sharing with FEMA and HHS their planned orders and allocations to states and to hospitals all over the region. This enables FEMA and HHS to work closely with states, local governments and private sector to allocate critical resources to highly impacted areas. Working together, we’re entirely focused on getting materials to the right place at the right time. So, we wanted to go directly to a hospital or directly to a certain state location and ideally, not even hit the state’s warehouses. If we can avoid the warehouses, it’s even better because they go directly into a hospital.  And one example of that is Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help and got us… Did a tremendous job along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns. 2.2 million gowns, think of what that is, 2.2 million to the strategic national stockpile from Ohio based Cardinal health. Cardinal health, we appreciate it and they’re making much more than that and different types of things.  We’re profoundly grateful for their contribution to protect the lives and safety of our healthcare professionals. Cardinal’s been working with us very well. FEMA and HHS formed a historic partnership with a private sector called Project Airbridge to bring supplies from other countries to the United States, including gloves, gowns, goggles and masks. These supplies will soon be distributed around the country. We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world. Every day, new plane loads are landing in cities such as New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles.  Additional flights have been scheduled and we’re adding more and more and they’re actually coming in ahead of schedule. A lot of these flights are coming in with a lot of material ahead of schedule, The amount of usage, the amount of need is something that nobody’s ever seen before. We are getting so much, but no matter how much we get, they seem to use it up very quickly. More than 17,000 national guard personnel have now been activated all across our country. On Tuesday, the vice-president sent a letter to the governors calling on them to have plans in place to use the national guard to move medical supplies from warehouses to hospitals. So, a lot of times we’ll deliver supplies to our in a state, someplace in New York or in New Jersey or in Connecticut or wherever it may be, and they’re having difficulty getting it moved.  So what we’re doing, if we don’t bring it directly to the hospital, is we’ve authorized, it was a special authorization, the national guard to go into that facility and to move it for the state. So, the national guard is moving a lot of this equipment and medical supplies into a hospital or into an area where it’s needed by the state. As I said yesterday, difficult days are ahead for our nation. We’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific, but even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair. We do not give into fear. We pull together, we persevere and we overcome and we win. This week, every American heart is joined with the people of New York as they continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic. To every New Yorker, please know that we are by your side.  I love New York and every day we will be with you and it could very well be that others take over from New York. There are some areas, some hotspots in other States that are really exploding. Some, like Louisiana, were very late and then all of a sudden, it was like an explosion. In confronting this deadly plague, America’s armed with capabilities never dreamed of in past centuries. You look at 1917, the pandemic, it was something. Ravaged parts of this country, but ravaged Europe. Ravaged. They say 75 to 100 million, some people say 50 to 75 million people died. Think of that and that was a long time ago, over a hundred years ago. Many books written about the 1917, 1918 pandemic.  Our doctors are pouring over the virus. Genetic code, designing potential therapies and vaccines. Our planes are airlifting supplies from every corner of the earth. We’re watching other countries and they’re watching us to see whether or not, and who’s going to be the first to come up with a cure or a remedy of some kind or even a help, if it can help.  And of course, a vaccine. We’re looking very strongly for a vaccine. Johnson and Johnson is doing well and other companies are doing very well. But our most powerful asset, our greatest weapon in this effort is the spirit of our people and we want to keep away, keep a distance, keep away. If you don’t get it, it solves a lot of problems. If you don’t get it, and you can’t get it if you keep the distance. American spirit is unyielding, unwavering and unbreakable. It’s incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it. The way the people have pulled together, the unity of this country. So, together we’re going to win this war and the sooner we do, the sooner we can begin to rebuild and we’re ready to rebound and return to normal lives. We went from the best economy of the history of the world, the best economy that this country has ever seen, the best employment numbers we’ve ever had.  160 million people working, almost 160 million to a point where the professionals came to me and they say, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut the country down.” I said, ” What does that mean?” They said, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut it down.” And we’re going to build it up and I think we’re going to build it up fast. I think we’re going to have a tremendous rebound. There’s a great energy and a great pent up demand, and as you know, phase three was terrific and phase four, what passed in Congress, and phase four if that happens will be great.  I already proposed paying almost zero interest on bonds and I proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which would not only fix our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and other things, but will also do something very good, it’s called jobs. I’m also asking that restaurants and entertainment facilities go back to the old deductibility from corporations, where corporations can buy, because otherwise a lot of these restaurants have got to have a hard time reopening. It takes a long time and they’re going to have a hard time reopening. So we’re asking for going back to deductibility where corporations can buy and corporations can go out to lunch and they pay and they get a deduction on what they eat. They get a deduction on the bill, and same with the entertainment. It’s going to bring a lot of people back. I think it’ll open up the restaurant business.  People forget that years ago they had that and when they got rid of it, when they ended it for whatever reason, but they ended it, many, many restaurants went out of business. Many entertainment type facilities went out of business and now’s a great time to bring it back. It was a terrible time for that business after they ended it, but this is a great time to bring it back. It’ll keep our restaurants going. In fact, I think the restaurant business will be actually bigger and better than it is right now. So, we’re also talking about that. And now, what we’ll do is we’ll take some questions and I see Mike is back with some of the folks. That’s great, Dr Fauci. And we will… Oh, how are you? Thank you Debra. So we’ll take some questions and we make progress day by day. Please? I think the severity. I think also in looking at the… I think the severity. I think, also, in looking at the way that the contagion… It is so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this where large groups of people, all of a sudden just by being in the presence of somebody having… The flu has never been like that. Flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Also the violence of it. If it hits the right person, and you know what those stats are. If it hits the right person, that person’s in deep trouble. And my friend was the right person. No. Not a turning point. Before then, I knew how… Because I’m seeing numbers that I’m seeing, statistics that are not exactly very good. But it hit him very hard. He’s strong. A very strong kind of a guy, but he’s older, he’s heavier, and he’s sort of central casting for what we’re talking about, and it hit him very hard. I’ve never seen anything like it. Yeah,  . Well, we’re thinking about doing that. At the same time we just… to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over again is very tough, john. It’s very tough. And you have them going, in some cases, from hotspot to hotspot. If you notice, they’re usually hotspot to hotspot. Very few flights, New York to Miami, but we’re certainly looking at it, but once you do that, you really are clamping down an industry that is desperately needed. Well, we’re going to. That is a calculation that we’re looking at right now. We’re looking at it very strongly. Please. Yeah, sure. Because states are different, and I understand that the Governor of Florida, great governor, Ron DeSantis issued one today, and that’s good, that’s great. But there are some states that are different. There are some States that don’t have much of a problem. There are some, well, they don’t have the problem. They don’t have thousands of people that are positive or thousands of people that even think they might have it or hundreds of people in some cases.  So you have to look at states. You have to give a little bit of flexibility. We have a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska as an example, doesn’t have a problem, it’s awfully tough to say close it down. So we have to have a little bit of flexibility. Look, we’re helping governors. We’re really here to help governors. They’re the front line of attack, and that includes in purchasing, by the way. We’re here, and we’re backing them up, and there’s never been a backup like we’ve given them. We’ve given them billions of dollars worth of things, medical supplies and ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators. We have thousands under construction right now. We have thousands ready to go in case they need it. There’s never been anything like this.  They’ve done, really, the people, have done incredibly. We’re building hospitals all over the country. We’re building hospitals right now at a rate that has never even been contemplated before. They’re mobile hospitals, but they’re really not mobile. They’re incredible structures, but we’re building many hospitals. Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, we just finished a massive hospital complex. And we also have medical centers built in New York. We’re building hospitals at the rate that this country has never done before. And hopefully it’s all going to work out. We’re looking at the whole thing because we’re getting into a position now where we want to do that, we have to do that, and so we’re looking at the whole thing and we may have some recommendations. From 1950, these are oil prices. And that’s when they had big dollars. Big, beautiful dollars. Look, we have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged. And, as you know, Russia, and I spoke to President Putin, we had a great call, Russia, Saudi Arabia. I spoke with the Crown Prince. We had a great call. But I think that they will work it out over the next few days. If you ask me, I think it’s too simple not to be able to. They both know what they have to do. So I think I have confidence in both that they’ll be able to work it out.  But it has ravaged an industry worldwide not here, I mean worldwide, the oil industry has been ravaged. So there was a lot of oil production to start off with, and then on top of it, it got hit with the virus, and business went down 35, 40% so that that business is a tough one. And they have ships all over the sea. I told you yesterday, all over the sea, massive tankers that they are using for storage. They go out, and they just sit there. There’s no place to go. They have massive amounts.  Now gasoline is going to be 99 cents a gallon and less. You know that. That’s already starting. It’s popping up, 99 cents. So that’s like giving a massive tax cut to people of our country when. We try and get the airlines going, if fuel is costing much less, it helps with getting the airlines, which is always a tough business, always has been a tough business. But with that being said, look, I want to get that industry back where it was. We were doing records in that industry, also. We want to get it back to where it was. So I think that Saudi Arabia, Russia, they’re negotiating, they’re talking, and I think they’ll come up with something.  I’m going to meet with the oil companies on Friday. I’m going to meet with the independent oil producers also on Friday or Saturday, maybe Sunday, but we’re having a lot of meetings on it. I think I know what to do to solve it, but if they’re unable to solve it, then I think I know what to do to solve it. We won’t mention it now, but it’s tough. I think I know what to do to solve it. We don’t want to lose our great oil companies. You know, we’re the number one producer of oil in the world, and a month ago when you said that it was great. Today when you say it, it’s not so meaningful. But I do believe there’s a way that that can be solved or pretty well solved. And I’d rather not do that.  I think that Russia and Saudi Arabia, at some point, they’re going to make a deal in the not too distant future because it’s very bad for Russia. It’s very bad for Saudi Arabia. It’s very bad. I mean, it’s bad for both, so I think they’re going to make a deal. You know, the free market is a wonderful thing. It’s amazing how it could work, but I think they’re going to make a deal. Yeah, please. Over there. Well, when you’re saying undocumented, meaning they came in illegally, and a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won’t be working. So what are you going to do? It’s a tough thing. It’s a very terrible… It’s a very sad question. I must be honest with you. But they came in illegally, and we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won’t be able to have jobs. Now, I do think, once we get rid of the virus, I think we’re going to have a boom economy.  I think it’s going to go up rather quickly, maybe very quickly and maybe slowly, but it’s going to go up and it’ll all come back. And I think it’s actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus. But it’s a really a sad situation, and we are working on it. I will tell you, I’m not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it’s something I think about, and it’s something we’re working on. Please. Go ahead. He doesn’t need security. Everybody loves him.  says that they would be in big trouble if they ever attack. You know, he was a great basketball player. Did anybody know that? He was a little on the short side for the NBA, but he was talented. I read this, he won a game that was unwinnable against a great team, and his whole team said, “We can’t beat this team.” And he went in and they won the game, right? That was a couple of years ago. The head never changes. The attitude never changes. Yes, please. He does. He did. He spoke to me. That I don’t know. He spoke for me this morning. Who can? I didn’t speak to him about it, but he did speak to me this morning. We talked about. Please. I don’t know. It would have to look at what he did. I like it. I like it. Well, I think it’s something we’re discussing in terms of bonus or bonus pay. It doesn’t have to be called hazard pay. Could be called… Hey, look, I watched those people going to hospitals that I know. I talked about one of them, right? But I watched them walk into those hospitals, and they walk in, men, women, young, middle age, not so many older ones, and I watch them. They’re almost like… And I think I take the word almost out. They’re like warriors. They’re going in. People are cheering. Where there’s a building across the street, the people are screaming, they’re clapping. They’re like heroes. No, no. I will tell you, I think it’s incredible. They’re like warriors. They like soldiers. And we’re going to be doing something for them, so whether it’s bonus because we’re hopefully going to be over this relatively quickly. It’s going to be vicious for a period of time, but hopefully we’re going to be over this. You have a lot of questions today. Look at you. Do you know this young lady behind you? That’s good. That’s a good idea. It’s good for a marriage. Okay. They took that up under the task force and make maybe Mike, do you want to say a few words about it. John, I think it’s a very fair question, though, and it’s something we’re really going to look at because it doesn’t seem fair. If you have it, you have a big advantage and at a certain income level you do. I think it’s one of the greatest answers I’ve ever heard because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question. I said that’s what you call a great professional. Let me just tell you, it’s really a fair question, and it’s something we’re looking at. It’s a certain group. And it’s a pretty big group. We’re looking at it. I haven’t been up there yet. The other people have been talking about it, and they haven’t spoken to- They’re talking about it- I know, but they’re talking about it in the 2020 election too, and nobody’s gotten to it. Nobody’s talked about it at all. I think we will. Yeah. I think we’re going to get to it. I think we’re going to get to it. I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even-  I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even spoken about it and it’s a big group of people. No, not committing but it’s something we’re going to look at. I can’t commit. I have to get approval from it. I have a thing called Congress, but it’s something we’re going to look at and we have been looking at it. If there is a phase four, but we’re certainly looking at certain things. We want to help restaurants, entertainment. We want to help because it’s jobs. Not the restaurants, it’s jobs, tremendous amounts of jobs. So we’re looking at that. We’re looking at infrastructure. When you think of it, we will have spent $8 trillion and way back. We’re way pulled back, but we will have spent $8 trillion in the Middle East and yet our roads are in bad shape. Our bridges, our tunnels, bad shape. We’re going to be the talk of the world again soon, but we want two trillion. We will have spent in the Middle East and all we got out of it was death and cost. But all we got out of it was death. Millions of people. You have to look at the other side too. Millions and millions of people killed. Our great soldiers, thousands killed, so many wounded, hurt. Yet when we want to go and fix a road someplace, we want to do what we want to do in our country. It’s time that we spend money on our country. That’s what we’re going to do.  It’s time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools, and all of the things that we’re supposed to be spending on. People are finally getting used to it. You could look at all of what we’ve done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places, way back in other countries too by the way. I’ve gone to other countries that are very rich. I said, I’m sorry, you’re going to have to reimburse us for our costs. They don’t even want to know what I’m talking about. It takes them 20 minutes to figure it out because nobody’s ever asked them to do that and they’re doing it. They’re doing it and they have no choice. They have to do it. So it’s time that we start spending on the USA. Please. Many countries all over the world want to know whether or not they could use, especially our new test that was just developed by Abbott, which is almost instantaneous, which is going to be great. Remember this, we inherited. The word is we inherited bad tests, we literally inherited bad tests. These are horrible tests and it was broken. It was all broken and we fixed it. We’re doing millions of tests. Sometimes we send out a test and it’s not used. In many cases it wasn’t used, but we worked with the States and the testing has been pretty amazing. Especially considering the fact that we inherited a very broken system. Jeff. I am looking at hotspots. I am looking where flights are going into hotspots. Some of those flights I didn’t like from the beginning, but closing up every single flight on every single airline, that’s a very, very, very rough decision. But we are thinking about hotspots where you go from spot to spot, both hot. We’ll let you know fairly soon. Similar thing. We have trains going back and forth. People don’t think of trains, but we do a lot of transportation business. It’s a very big decision to do that. We’re pretty late in the process from the standpoint that this is starting. You’re going to start seeing, I think over the next couple of weeks, you’re going to start to see us hit a top and start coming down. So we’ll make those decisions. Those are very, very big decisions from the standpoint of the future of our country in a way, in the future of our country. We have to get our country back. We have to start moving again. We have to start working again. They’re doing tests on airlines, very strong tests for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains, getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do. The re use. I love the sterilization of the masks. Ohio Company, you can sterilize the N95. You can sterilize that mask for up to 20 times. Think of that, up to 20 times. We’re throwing them out and they’re very expensive masks. They’re throwing them out. I kept saying, one of the first questions I asked to Dr. Fowchee. I said, why aren’t they sterilized or cleaning the masks? Because it wasn’t my thing exactly when we first heard about this. Nobody else knew it either. Now we have a company and I guess a number of companies, one in Ohio, a great one that makes equipment where you can sterilize a mask up to 20 times, which is fantastic. I don’t believe. Look, there’s a big thing. A lot of people don’t like it. Some people don’t like it because you’re taking it away from the medical professional. Some people don’t like it for other reasons. I don’t see where it hurts and it doesn’t have to be a mask. It can be a scarf. Scarf is highly recommended by the professionals. I don’t see where it hurts. I think frankly, if people wanted to do it, we don’t want to do anything that’s going to take masks. You’re talking about a tremendous amount of masks when you do that. We don’t want to take them away from our medical professionals, but I certainly don’t see it hurting. But what I do see people doing now is using scarves. I think in a certain way, depending on the fabric, I think in a certain way the scarf is better. It’s actually better. Yeah, please. You . My biggest disappointment is that churches can’t meet in a time of need. This is really a great time for churches to be together, for people to get together on a Sunday or any day and meet. Yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you’re really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage. So it’s the biggest, I think the single biggest disappointment. One of the reasons I said, wouldn’t it be great just to pick a date as I called it aspirational. An aspirational date would be Easter. I will tell you, it’s very, very disappointing. But again, you get too close and if somebody’s sick, you’re going to probably catch it. So you have to be very careful. . Did he write the statement or get did PR person write it? Good. . That’s okay. Sure. Oh absolutely. I’d love to. I’d love to speak to him too. I’d be in  I always found him to be a nice guy. I don’t know him very well, frankly, but I think he’s probably a nice guy. No, if he’d like to call it, I’d absolutely take his call. You can tell him. And no ammunition. Maybe no ammunition. We didn’t do that. That turned out to be a false story. Now you’re starting to go. What are you working for, CNN?  with Fox. Fox isn’t so easy either. Don’t kid yourself. Look, John, let me tell you something. You know that’s a false story. What you just said is a false story. This doctor knows it better than anybody. No, but you shouldn’t be repeating a story that you know is false. All right. Who’s next? Please, go ahead in the back. You didn’t get one. It’s very sad what’s happening in Iran. Look, we have to talk to them. I think we could work out a deal with Iran very quickly. All they have to do is call. I just think that they’re proud people and the leadership is proud. They’re proud like all of us. We’re proud you. You people are proud. They’re having a hard time picking up the phone or they’re having a hard time setting up the meeting, but they could fix their country pretty easily. We don’t want hostility, but if they are hostile to us, they’re going to regret it like they’ve never regretted anything before, as per today’s statement. But all they have to do is call or have somebody call. There are channels where we can deal very easily. Again, I think that John Kerry did a tremendous disservice. I think he violated the Logan Act 100%. that’s what I think. I think it made it tough for them because they were dealing with them for years.  It was a terrible deal. All of that money, $150 billion plus cash, plus cash, plane loads of cash, for a deal that was no good and was short term. Essentially it was a short term deal. Who makes a deal for that kind of money and $1.8 billion in cash? I don’t even know what that would look like. That would be this room would have to be filled up five times with hundred dollar bills. Who makes a deal like this? Then on top of it, the deal is no good. All right. How about one or two more? Mexican violence? It could be. It’s another cost of not getting our country working. Some people are getting along great. I’ve also had the exact opposite question. Families are coming together. They’re actually coming together. They haven’t talked for a long time and now all of a sudden they’re talking again, they’re loving each other. So I’ve heard that too, but I also have heard domestic violence at a higher level. And drug use because of, in this case, they’d lose their jobs. They had a great job, they had a great life, they have a great family. All of a sudden the husband’s told that he doesn’t have a job anymore and he’s got no money, and that brings drugs into it. That brings suicide into it. It’s a terrible thing. We have to get our country going again. We did the right thing. We had no choice. We did the right thing.  Other countries tried to use the herd or the herd mentality. It’s just something that doesn’t work. Just to say, I heard Sweden gave it a shot and they saw things that were really frightening. They went immediately to shutting down the country. We did the right thing and we did it early. We did it early and we stopped other people from coming into our country early. But no, that’s a cost. I’ve been talking about that. People will say, what are you talking about? But you will have. You’ll have that. You’ll have domestic violence. You’ll have violence. You’ll have suicide. You’ll have drug addiction. A lot of people are going to be lost. We want to get this open as soon as we can. I mean, I’ll be the happiest person. So will you, everyone in this room happy when we get the word that this is the time. We have our common sense and they’ll give me a decision or they’ll be making certain statements. I think I’ll know how to interpret those statements very well. I’ll be with Mike, I’ll be with the task force. I’ll be with a lot of very talented people, including the two people on stage with us. But I look forward, that’ll be a great day. That’ll be a great day. All right. How about one more please? Sure.  While you’re up, could you talk about how tight that southern border is right now? But I am glad you asked that question because we want the farmers, they’ve had this for years. We want the farmers to be able to get the people that have been working those farms for years or we’re not going to have farms. So they’re going to come in and they’re going to be given a certain pass. We’re going to check them very, very closely, especially over the next month. Because remember after a month or so, I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be hopefully worried too much about the virus, but we want them to come in. We’re not closing the border so that we can’t get any of those people to come. They’ve been there for years and years. I’ve given the commitment to the farmers they’re going to continue to come or we’re not going to have any farmers. One more question. Who are you with, by the way? Boy, amazing. Who else please? We’re looking at the two ships. We have Canada notified, a lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship. They’re coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland. Canada’s coming, UK is coming, and we have Americans. We have some people that are quite sick and we’re taking care of that. I’m speaking with the governor about that a lot and it’s a tough situation. It’s a tough situation. You can understand you have people that are sick on those ships. States don’t want to take, they have enough problems right now. They don’t want to take them, but we have to from a humane standpoint. We don’t have a choice. It’s like I don’t want to do that, but we have to. People are dying. We’re going to do something. We’re going to do something. At a minimum, we’re sending medical teams on board the ships. We’re taking the Canadians off and giving them to Canadian authorities. They’re going to bring them back home. The same thing with the UK, but we have to help the people. They’re in big trouble. No matter where, no matter where they’re from. Happened to be Americans, largely Americans. But whether they were or not, I mean they’re dying. So we have to do something. The governor knows that too. Well we’re sending a lot of them home. We’re sending a lot of them home to their countries, but we’ll be doing something and we’ll be announcing it. You’ll see what we’re doing. But we’re also putting medical staff onto the ships so that we can … we have to take care of the people. No you won’t actually. You know. I had heard that. Now, I don’t know. Do you know that answer Mike? It sounds like it. We could get back. It’s a process that they’re working on. We’ll get back to you as soon as we find out. All right, one more please. I did. I spoke to him. He’s great. He’s a great guy and he’s doing a wonderful job from Brazil.  Spoke to him this morning and just a very complimentary call. He’s working very hard. He’s got a problem with the virus, got a big problem. We talked about it today at length. We had a call this morning and Brazil is shut down as you know. They weren’t going to shut it down, but they had to. So Brazil is shut down. The world is shut down. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The entire world is shut down. You go from having the most powerful economy in the world and from other countries that are doing well, to being everything is shutdown. It’s very sad, but we’re going to get it going and we’re going to be stronger than ever. I really believe that. We’re going to be stronger. We’re going to have a big bounce, a very big bounce when this is gone. I just want to thank the American people. I want to thank these great professionals and I want to thank the media because really for the most part, the media has been very fair. Thank you very much everybody."
"Okay. Thank you very much. Good to be with you all. We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus. It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the 30 days to slow the spread. The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved. We’re going to save a lot of American lives. We’re in control of our own fate, very much so. Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger.  While you’re fighting this battle from home we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world. We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine, and we’re making a lot of progress, I think medically a lot of progress.  At the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know. I want to remind small business owners across America that the paycheck protection program is launching tomorrow. Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses including sole proprietors. These loans are up to 100% forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers, got to take care of your workers.  Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens. The treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts, and don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare and your Medicaid. We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and I always will.  I’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza who is doing a fantastic job. She’s going to be very busy in the next little while and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives and then we’ll get onto the attack of the virus itself and please if I might, Steve and Jovita. Thank you Steve. For Jovita or Steve, any questions? Thank you all. Thank you, Steve. Good job. Thank you. Okay, so that begins right away and they start handing out checks, and a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly I hope. And we’ll see it. Complicated big small businesses, actually big business. So I thank them both. And please, we have some great gentlemen. Let me see, great gentlemen. That’s correct. Thank you very much.  Today, my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly Americans who remain the most vulnerable. By now, nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel. Today we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread, and we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents. And this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy has gone, this particular enemy is gone.  We’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans. We take very good care of our veterans. At my direction Secretary Wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections. We’re now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day. It’s over 100,000 tests a day, and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly, which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most.  The FDA has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed a body Cellex, a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system. Moments ago I directed Secretary Azar, and acting Secretary Wolf to use any and all available authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of C-O-V-I-D-19. You know what that is, right? Become a very famous term C-O-V-I-D. COVID.  This action will help General Electric Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, Royal Phillips, and Vyaire Medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators. We have over 100,000 being built right now or soon to be started. We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future. In addition to the one that I’ve just signed against 3M for face masks, we just signed an element of the act against 3M and hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do.  Just spoke to Mary Barra of General Motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators. They have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build, and they’ll be starting very, very quickly. FEMA continues to deliver resources to areas most effected by the virus, including New York. On top of the 3,000 beds we’re already providing to the Javits Center, the Department of Defense is adding another 48 ICU beds.  Governor Cuomo has asked that this facility go and it’s a big beautiful facility. It’d be converted to a COVID hospital and we hadn’t done that yet. We hadn’t thought in terms of doing that, but their use is, their real demand is for that. And we had meetings on it with the task force. We had meetings with the military and I’ve decided to say, yes, I’m going to do that. That I will be signing and agreeing to a yes answer so that we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it so the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do. This is a 2,500 and/or 2,900, can easily be set up, hospital built in Javits Center. And so we’re going to be converting that to a COVID-19 hospital and it’s going to be a staffed by the military and by the federal government.  And based on the fact that I agreed to that, we had two other facilities that will likewise asking for it and that would be in Louisiana and also in Dallas and we’ll be doing those. We spoke to the governor of Louisiana, spoke to the governor of Texas, and we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals again above and beyond, but that’s okay. We have to do that. In addition to USNS Comfort is docked in New York to accept patients that is non-COVID.  To date FEMA has delivered more than 4 million N95 mask respirators. Think of that, 4 million, 4 million. Don’t forget we’re a secondary source. The states are doing it and we’re backing them up, but we’ve gotten 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves and 4,400 ventilators just to the city and to the State of New York and some of them now are being sent. I spoke with both the Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city.  All of America stands with the people of New York in this time of need. It’s definitely a hot spot, but we have other hotspots also and we’re taking care of them very, very strongly, very powerfully. We have the finest people in the world in those locations and I think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly, professionally. There’s no people like this. Doctors, nurses, first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help New York at this critical time should visit website, nyc.gov/helpnow. Nyc.gov/helpnow. they need help now. They need people to help them.  We have great facilities and we’ve built some brand new facilities, big ones, but we need help. We need help for professional people. So if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected, and you’re a doctor, a nurse, a health care worker, please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help. New York city needs it. Louisiana, by the way, needs it. Michigan needs it. Whatever you can do, those are very strong hotspots. They need help.  In recent weeks, as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed, we have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion. I want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations. Here we go again. I’ve already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It’s a witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they’ve been losing by a lot, and it’s not any time for witch hunts, it’s time to get this enemy defeated. Conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources, time, attention, and we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers cause that’s all they’re doing. Because everyone knows it’s ridiculous.  So we want to focus on the people of this country, even the people of the world, we’re going to be able to help them because right now, as an example, we’re building so many ventilators, very, very hard to build, but we’re building thousands, thousands of them and a lot of them will be coming at a time where we won’t need them as badly because it takes time. Very complex, very expensive. And we’ll be able to help outside of our country. We think we’ll be able to help. That’s something that you cannot easily produce. As citizens we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection.  We’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection. There’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts. And that is so true.  It’s incredible the job that everybody’s been doing. Everybody. They don’t sleep. They don’t go to bed. Sometimes they get nothing. Said to somebody recently on the task force, how many hours sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days? The answer was none. None.  In one Massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their homes each night at eight o’clock from their porches and they sing God Bless America. Others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all Americans that we’re all in this together. We’ll fight together and we will win together. We’re going to win this.  Now what I’d like to do is I’m going to step out.  We have a meeting on the subject and I’m going to step out just for a few moments. I’ll be right back. We’ll answer some questions. But you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by Vice President Mike Pence, head of the task force. And then Jared Kushner is going to say a few words and Admiral , Peter Navarro, Dr. Birx and myself.  I’ll be right back. So I’ll see you in a little while. I did take a test. It just came out. This is from the white house physician. It just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it. It took me literally a minute to take it and it took me, I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes. I went to work. I didn’t wait for it, but he said it took 14 minutes or something to come up with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for COVID 19.  So that’s the second one. I think I took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it’s a lot easier. I’ve done them both. And the second one is much more pleasant, Jeff, I can tell you that. Much more pleasant.  So I’ll be back in a little while and Mike please take over. Thank you. Thank you all very much. I’ll be right back. And coming here.  You did a good job, thank you. Go ahead. Go ahead, answer. You go ahead. Come here. Com here. And by the way, we’ve cut them out also to be honest. We’ve stopped orders going from certain places and… In a couple of places we had a big order going to Italy on important outfits and some ventilators and it was going to Italy. They made the order a long time ago and I said, “You got to let it go.” They’ve had an order and I could have cut it under the act. I could have cut it. I said, “Nope, can’t do that. You’ve got to let it go.” They have big problems. We had an order going to Spain and I said, “Let it go.” I could have stopped it. I said, “Let it go. We’re going to be fine.” I said, “Let it go.” So it works that way also.  One other thing that’s to your question, oftentimes, and we’ve told this to the governors, Mike, we’ve been very strong on this. If you think there’s bidding between federal government and state, let us know and we’ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price… . No. No. If we’re bidding against each other I said find out who it is. And usually they know, everyone knows and we’re notified and we get notified and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out. But we have another problem. There are 151 countries out there beyond the States. There are 151 countries that have this problem and they’re ordering, too. It’s really a mess  Now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because it takes a while to build them and we have thousands of them being built right now. In a little while they’ll be worth about $5 but right now they’re very valuable and we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped. In fact, that’s why General Motors called up before, Mary. That’s why others called up two days ago. They called up that they’re all in production and they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half, but there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles.  By the way, the States should have been building their stockpile. We have almost 10,000 and our stockpile and we’ve been building it and we’ve been supplying it, but the States should be building. We’re a backup. We’re not an ordering clerk. We’re a back up and we’ve done an unbelievable job. Like for instance, whoever heard of a governor calling up, ” Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?” And we built it. “Can you build us four medical centers?” We built it. “Can you deliver a ship, a hospital ship with a thousand rooms?” And we did it and we did it in Los Angeles, too. We’ve been unbelief. We’ve done an unbelievable job… These people and thousands of people behind them, but we’re a backup. Ideally those hospitals would have had all this equipment. Ideally those States should have had all this equipment and I think they will the next time.  You heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money. You’re talking about, I think it was $1 billion, but you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen. Because normally on a ventilator other than a pandemic or an epidemic, you wouldn’t need anything like this. Hospitals have three ventilators, big hospitals, and they get by with it. And now they want thousands. I mean they want thousands of ventilators. You call up a governor and they’ll say, “Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators?” Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. So they’ve done some job. Let me just tell you when secretary Mnuchin spoke, they want you to call not .com but sba.gov, okay? For the application and for information, okay? So it’s SBA, small business, sba.gov, okay? If you don’t mind. Yeah, let’s go, please… Yeah. I understand the question and we’re doing better than that. We’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people and we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature, so we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much. So we’re going to work it out so we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people… It’s a certain group of people, a cash payment. Well, they have that and they have to work that out. What they should do is they should have, long before this pandemic arrived, they should have been, on the open market, just buying. There was no competition. You could have made a great price. The States have to stock up. It’s like one of those things they waited, they didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen and their shelves in some cases were bare. And by the way, in some cases they weren’t. They were beautifully serviced. They did a good job, but in some cases their shelves were bare.  So the best thing they can do is when times become normalized, and they will hopefully soon… And actually you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear, protective outfits, a lot’s being done. It’s going to be within six months. It’s going to be sold for the right price. They got to stack up for the next time. But we are doing that and the Admiral’s done a fantastic job. Senator Schumer wrote a letter today and he says, you should put a military manager. Just said, well, “Chuck, if you knew a little bit more, we have one of the most highly respected people in the military, the Admiral. This is what he does, too. Very professionally. And he’s in charge.” But Chuck didn’t know that.  Okay. I don’t know what they’re agreeing to. I think they might agree to more than that. Look, Russia  yeah, we did say that actually. Russia talked about 10 million barrels. Russia and Saudi Arabia are fighting over this and as everybody knows, it’s really killing an industry, hurting Russia badly, hurting Saudi Arabia badly. I said, “This is an easy one. It should be an easy one.” And it may be 10 and it may be more than that. I was actually told it may be 10 as I told somebody before, it may be 10 and it may be more than that. Maybe it’s 15 maybe it goes up to 15 could be as high as 15 and there’s a tremendous oversupply right now. That industry was oversupplied before the virus and where the virus came along, they lost 35, 40% of the world.  And there’s an unbelievable… You can’t get a ship now. Every ship is loaded to the gills sitting out someplace in the ocean. They’re storage tanks, they’re not even ships, they’re storage tanks. So it would be great for Russia. It would be great for Saudi Arabia. I hope they make that deal. But that’s what they told me. They said it’s…  Well, I think it’ll be hopefully soon. I think hopefully they’ll announce something soon. Now can a deal be broken? Can something happen where it doesn’t happen? I guess in which case there’s another alternative, but I’d rather not see that other alternative. I hope they can make a deal. I think they both want to make a deal and they’re both smart. They love their countries, they want to make a deal. It’s good, but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry. Go ahead. Go ahead in the back. We went over this very specifically and I’ll let you talk about it, Mike, as you responded last time. No, but I talked to him about it and he wants to do what’s right for the people of Florida. He’s been a great governor. You could see that just by his popularity, which is extraordinary. We’re proud of him. He’s done a fantastic job. And he made the decision, but we spoke before he made the decision. Yes. That I haven’t heard, no. That I haven’t heard. I haven’t heard that. Well, I think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that and if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don’t think they’ll be mandatory because some people don’t want to do that. But if people want… As an example on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can. If people wanted to use scarves, which they have, many people have them, they can. In many cases the scarf is better. It’s thicker. Depending on the material, it’s thicker. But they could do that if they want. Now a recommendation’s coming out. We’ll see what that recommendation is.  But I will say this, they can pretty much decide for themselves right now. All right. Maybe I will ask Dr. Burkes. And you might mention that other point also. They are being made. They’re moving very quickly. We didn’t discuss that. They want to do that. That’s good for their countries and we did not discuss that now.  we’re going to wait a little while because I understand there’s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that. But you know, I don’t agree with that at all. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Yeah. Well, they have experts and frankly long after we came out and talked about it… Look, how would I have known to cut off China? I cut off China very early and if I didn’t, we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe. So how would I know to do that? How would I know to cut off Europe? I cut off Europe very early. You have to make a decision. People knew that some bad things were going on and they got off to a late start and some others got off to a late start also, but we cut off China. If we didn’t cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble and we cut it off and you know what? We cut it off way early. Go ahead Okay, go ahead. Who are you with? So we haven’t discussed it but we’re talking to them. Getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones was a tremendous thing. That’s a lot of money they gave up, but we’re discussing that with the insurance companies. We’ll let you know. It’ll be pretty quickly. Yeah, go ahead. Well, we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans. We have more bans than anybody. We had bans when bans weren’t fashionable, if you remember right at the beginning of this administration was for different reasons. But we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans. When I did China, it had never been done before. I was the first one to do to remember that it had never, according to what I read it all the papers, this had never been done. This is a terrible thing to do. And four weeks later they were all saying, we’re lucky we did it. So we’re looking at it. No, we heard that. And I think it’s fine that they do that. They’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country. Yeah, please. He’s a good governor, Brian Kemp. He’s a very good…  he’s a good. He’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that. I let the States… I think we’re about 85% a positive on that. If you look, I think it’s about 85% of the States have got the stay at home. Brian’s a great governor. It’s his decision. He made that decision. Ultimately he decided to go along with it and they’re doing well and the state is doing well in many respects. Yeah, go ahead please. We’re accepting it. It was a very nice offer from President Putin. I spoke to him the other night as I told you, and they had excess medical equipment, things and I’ll take it, I’ll take it. I think it’s very nice.  We’ve had some from China. We also help other countries. We like doing that. Like I said before, if we have excess stuff, we let it go out. We let some go out where frankly they had orders for it and I didn’t want to stop orders. It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin and I could have said “No thank you” or I could have said “Thank you” and it was a large plane of very high quality medical supplies and I said, ” I’ll take it.” I think he would if we asked for it, but he was very nice. It was part of the call he suggested. He said, we have it, it’s additional. They have very big difficulties with this virus also, as you know, Russia. I thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin. I could’ve said, “No, I don’t want it.” Or I could have said, “I’ll take it”, and you know what? I said, “I’ll take it.” I think so. Yeah. If they sent things that we need, I’d take it. Sure. Nice gesture. I’m not concerned about Russian propaganda. Not even a little bit. He offered a lot of medical, high quality stuff that I accepted, and that may save a lot of lives. I’ll take it everyday. Please. In the back. Well, they’re very hard hit. They’re very hard hit.  In a lot of ways they’re hard hit. They’re hard hit with their economy, with their military.  Hard hit. They are hit with their economy, with their military, and obviously the virus. They’re very hard hit. Well, they haven’t even asked us to do that. You know what? They haven’t even asked us to do that. If they want to meet, would love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out, but I doubt they’ll be. I think they love America. I think the Iranians love America. I think they’d love to be free. I think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have. I remember Iran many years ago, friends of mine were always in Iran. They were doing real estate deals in Iran. They were building beautiful buildings all over Iran. Apartment houses. They were very successful and then one day that came to an end, but you know what? The people of Iran, they remember that. It was a long time ago, but not so long ago, and they remember it. And I’ll tell you, they love America. They love what we stand for and we’re not looking for change. We’re not looking for government takeover. Government change. This country has been through that many times. That doesn’t work. No, but what I did is I put it out very publicly with respect to Iran. I said, if they need help with respect to the virus, we have the greatest medical professionals in the world. We’d love to send them over. I’m not encouraging or discouraging. They’ve been a very hostile country. They made a deal that President Obama should have never made. It was a short-term deal, giving them $150 billion, giving them $1.8 billion in cash. Green. Fill up this room five times. Nobody’s even asked. I have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask. If they needed help, I would certainly consider different plans. Well, that’s up to the United Nations. I’m talking about us and what happens is, if they wanted help, because they have a very big case of virus. A very, very big case. One of the worst on earth, if you believe what you’re reading. And I happen to believe what I see and what I know and if they wanted help, we’d give them help. Yeah, you had one in the back. Or they don’t exist. Those sources don’t exist. They’re fake sources. A lot of fake sources out there. They don’t exist. For a lot of time I’ve been reading, a lot of the fake sources they don’t exist. The national stockpile, But Deborah, aren’t you referring to just a few states because many of those States are dead flat?  But, again, I look at the graphs all the time and you have many, many flatliners. I call them flatliners. I’m amazed at that. And you have a couple that are up. It’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job. Yeah, because I saw those pens going five minutes ago. They were thrilled. The fact is, yes, we compare them to Italy, one place, and we have many places that are really doing, and I think that’s what Deborah meant. She didn’t mean all of them, so when you write your story tomorrow, maybe you’ll write it correctly. She was talking about one state and another state is having a hard time and they’re closely associated. By the way, the people are doing a very good job, including the people that live there. But, when Deborah was talking about Italy, she was talking about the one and then the other was lower and then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable. So, she wasn’t talking about the average of everything.  She was talking about an individual state, which is, I think, still better than Italy. Italy is having a hard time. By the way, Spain is having a hard time. France is having a hard time, but our states, generally speaking, it’s like lots of different countries all over. Many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job. They’re really flat and I think that’s what you meant. I don’t know. I don’t want to speak for her.  But that’s what I understood she meant. Yeah, please. Because some states they stay in better, they’re not touching, whatever it is. They’re not going out. They’re not in groups and some states are not probably as good for whatever reason, or they also live a lot closer. New York is very dense, and California is pretty dense too and they’ve got a very good record going so far. We hope it doesn’t spike up, but it’s very flat. We have states that are doing incredibly well. When I looked at some of them, I looked at some states that I would’ve thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well, and they’re really flatlined. Hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way.  I want them. That’s what I’m saying. No. But when Debra mentioned about Italy and our country, she wasn’t referring to our country. She was referring to one state. Okay, so my understanding … I’m going to let her say it, but I think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most States are doing. Thrilled. The flatline states, states that have almost no bump. I mean, I would think … now, then you others where for whatever reason, they’re higher. That’s different, but you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to Italy where they have some very unique problems. In all fairness to Italy, they have some very unique problems. But if you’d like to come up and- A lot of them. That’s exactly … I think that’s perfect. So, I just want to say, many states have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level. Some really stayed at a great level. Louisiana’s an example. It was low and slow, and they were looking great. I was watching it because it’s a place people go to with Mardi Gras, which is an interesting point because after Mardi Gras it was low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly and now it’s one of our true hotspots. Certain areas of Michigan. Detroit looked like it was doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up. So, you have that too. But I’ll tell you what, we have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so low. You haven’t seen the bump and I hope you don’t. I hope you don’t.  And you have a couple that, for a lot of different reasons, and that’s not to blame anybody, but they are at a higher level. But very few. I think, Deborah, I mean, I may say, I think most people have actually followed the presidential you can call them whatever you want. I would never use the word dictates because if I used that word I would be in such trouble. In fact, you’ll put me in trouble just that I even mentioned the thought of it. But we make a recommendation and I think they’ve done a good job. Maybe they started a little later, but maybe they’re also more difficult states. But we’ve done I think on average really phenomenally as a country. I think we’ve done phenomenally because when you looked at that graph the other day, I don’t know if you saw it, I assume you saw it.  Everybody in the world saw it, but you look at all those lines on the bottom, one color after another, all different representing different states. It’s all crowded at the bottom. And then you had two that were up. I don’t know, almost every one of them was down low, very low. So, there were a lot of people listening and I just want it clear because I don’t need headlines tomorrow. Neither does the country because I don’t want this country working so hard and then have press, in this case, may be misinterpret something because when I heard it, I was surprised at first too. But I understood what Deborah meant. Because I think it’s very important for you to be accurate. One other thing, just a quick thing. So, what I found is when governors called me, I think in every case they’ve always been so nice, so nice and I’ve seen them and heard them say “Thank you, very much.”  “You have done a great job, a fantastic job in one case. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” Then I’ll see the governor, usually of the opposite party in almost all cases except maybe one, but in almost all cases they’re very generous. They’re very nice. They thank me, everything’s great. We’re doing a great job. And then I’ll see him on television and it’s like a different person. And I realize there are some people, because of politics, that if they say, “We want a thousand ventilators” and I’ll say, “No, Jim. I want to give you 5,000 ventilators.”  They’ll say, “Thank you. You are the greatest president that’s ever lived.” And then I’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they’ll say, “The president didn’t come through for me. I’m very disappointed in the president.” And we have a lot of that. They’re very happy when they talk to me, Then I see them. But there are some people, if they asked for 500 of something and if I gave him 5,000, you’ll say, “How’s the president doing?” “Well, we don’t like the job.” To my face they’re very nice. But, then sometimes, I guess they assume I don’t watch them or something, but I watch very closely. Yeah, please. Well, there’s vulnerable and then there’s close together. I can’t tell you about age, but a lot of young people in prison. Some people, some states, I have not done that at all, but some states are letting people out of prison. Some people are getting out that are very serious criminals in some states, and I don’t like that. I don’t like it. But it’s a city or state thing, in certain cases, as you know. I think, maybe Philadelphia comes to mind. So, we’ll have to see what’s going on. We don’t like it. The people don’t like it. And we’re looking in to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases. Okay? Oh, I think it’s terrible. I think it’s terrible. So, look, four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest in the world. Greatest in the history of the world. We had the most jobs ever in the history of the United States. Almost 160 million jobs. Right? And then one day, I get a call from Deborah who’s fantastic and from Dr. Fauci and he said, and she said, “We have a problem.” I said, “What’s the problem?” And they said, “We may have to close it up.” I said, “Close what up?” They said, “Close up the country.” I said, “What’s that all about?” And we discussed today and probably not since 1917, came to that conclusion, and she is a fantastic person, a brilliant person, and this is what she knows. I said, “Has it ever been this bad?” And I think I can represent that you said no. And part of it is it’s a contagion.  It’s so contagious. It’s like if you sneeze, I probably get it. Whoever heard of a thing like that? And this very talented reporter is bailing out. He’s out of here. I don’t blame you, but it’s a very contagious thing, probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that. But 1917, so that’s over a hundred years ago. But it’s been written about many, many times. That was a horrible … whether it was 75 or 100 million people, I’ve heard from 50 to 75 I’ve heard 75 to 100, but it was tens of millions of people. Now, we have the advantage of communication. This could have been just as bad. I mean, here we can read on the internet, we can see what to do, we can have these meetings, they can watch on television, which they do. A lot of people are watching. A lot of people are watching, and they say, “Gee, social distancing.”  But in 1917 they didn’t have that option. They didn’t know what to do. They just noticed people were dying all over the place. Think of it. 75 to 100 million people died. A lot of people in this country died. To me, it’s a great question, how come more people didn’t die in this country? And they say it actually started in this country and went to Europe. I mean, we lost a lot of people, but relatively we lost very few compared to Europe. So, this is a terrible thing that happened and what’s happening now with people in jobs. So, think of the position I’m in. We have built all together, everybody, not me, everybody, the greatest economy in history, and all of a sudden people come in that we respect, that we know, and here’s the thing, they were right. Everybody questioned it for a while.  Not everybody, but a good portion questioned it. They said, “Let’s keep it open. Let’s ride it.” If we did that, you saw the other graph, and whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough, the number was 2.2 million people would’ve died. 2.2 million people would’ve died in a short period of time. In fact, the graph could have been even shorter. I always noticed that horrible one where it goes high, it actually comes down a little bit faster. It might’ve been over faster, and you would have lost 2.2 million people. So, they come in and they say, “We have to close up the country.” And I say, “You know what that does to the fabric of this country?” To people that had great jobs, great family, no problems with money? Their 401k, everything is perfect. Then all of a sudden, they go from that to having no job in one day they never even thought of it and then you see 6 million people unemployed.  Unemployment numbers get released and you see 6 million people and it’s an artificial closing. It’s not like we have a massive recession or worse. It’s artificial because we turned it off. Think of what we’re doing. We’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’ll pay you.” Everything’s the opposite. It was always “Go to work and make a lot of money and do well and the American dream.” Because of a hidden enemy we’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you.” Look at the money, $2 trillion and we will probably do more. I think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do. You want to get the restaurants back. You give deductibility. You understand what that is. You give deductibility for businesses where they go, and they use the restaurants. The restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before.  People don’t know, a lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility and then they started doing well, but they had fewer restaurants. But the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility, where corporations could use them. And entertainment, that was a great thing, but they closed it and then they closed it again and it wasn’t the same. But you want to get them back. You do that. But infrastructure, we borrow our money now at zero. If we were paying 5%, 4%, 3% it’s a different ball game. We can borrow long-term for zero. Literally zero. You know that because we’re considered the safe investment all over the world. They want money in the United States. That’s where they want the money. So, I know better than anybody. I know what they’re going through and it’s horrible, but you know what I want to do?  I want to be able to get them back fast. When this is over, it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate because everyone’s going to go to work and I think we’re going to have boom times. I think it’s going to be great, and we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned about borders; we’ve learned about reliance on other countries. We’ve learned so much that I think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger, and I think it’s going to come back very quickly, but first we have to defeat this enemy, so we will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much."
"With Kevin McCarthy, future speaker of the house, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you take a look at the bump, and how they’re doing out there. I congratulate everybody out there, but I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words. So Kevin, please. Great job you’re doing. Thank you. You go ahead. I’ll talk to you later. Okay. Thank you very much everybody. And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hotspot right now. But you have some others as you know, that are very bad, very bad. Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard. New Jersey is surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought. They’re doing a really good job. Governor is doing a really good job out there.  New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure. They’re the best in the world. We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource, financial, medical, scientific, we will not spare anything. We’ll get it back into shape. The Empire State, the governor’s doing an excellent job. They’re all working very hard together. At the request of the Governor, as you know, the Javits Center… We have 2,500 beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after. The patients can be looked after. That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents. It’s very interesting, the Governor is telling me, “We don’t have too many accidents, very few people driving.” So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility. The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.  And today also the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus. From recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. So, you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred. In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary, you don’t have to do. They suggested for a period of time, but this is voluntary.  I don’t think I’m going to be doing it, but you have a lot of ways you can look at it as follows. The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you’d have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused. I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services. The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time. Again, we’re going to all come back together here. We’re going all come back together. And, practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.  A lot of things I think are going to spill over. Shaking hands, maybe, will stay with our country for a long time beyond this. One of our great doctors was telling me that, as you know, we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial. He said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower. So maybe some of these things, longterm, will be good. But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.  So with the masks it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it, you don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that’s okay. It may be good, probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation, it’s voluntary.  We’ve also taken action to ensure no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus. The largest insurer nationwide, the Blue Cross Blue Shield system, has now announced that it will not require any copays, which is really something, that’s a tremendous statement, from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days. Similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem. Those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing. So copays, for them to do that is a big statement. We appreciate it.  Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the Economic Relief Package congress passed last month. That was as per the question yesterday, and actually the day before yesterday. This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment. So that, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.  I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. We need these items immediately for domestic use, we have to have them. But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.  We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies. Under that authority, this week the Department of Health and Human Services working with the Department of Justice took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves. As well as bottles, many, many, many bottles and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded. All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers, most of it’s already been given out. And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot to New Jersey, a lot to other places.  In addition, to ensure that health care workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government in the name of the Department of Defense is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators, Department of Defense. And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City. Mayor De Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor De Blasio in New York City and they were very grateful. 8.1 million, and we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more. That’s a lot of N95 respirators.  Today my team spoke with the CEO of Oschner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans. They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators. I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators, and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them. The CEO of Oschner, Warner Thomas, who’s really been fantastic I have to say, indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns and I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow. That’s Louisiana, New Orleans. 230,000 surgical gowns, they’ll have them by tomorrow. We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military. And we are in a war, the invisible enemy, remember. Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country. Like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits where we’ve taken over. And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get more people in the New York area. So we’re going to have it manned by the military, Javits Center.  National Guard members have been activated to help States build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies. That includes National Guard. The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the States were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies. So I’ve given approval to use the National Guard, the various National Guards in the different States. And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people, but delivering material.  The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 States and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many States. In New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio. They’re doing a lot of work in just those States, plus additionals that will be announced probably tomorrow, but they’re doing some job. The Army Corps of Engineers, what a job they’re doing. And FEMA, what a job they’re doing.  As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers. We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies in the treatment and prevention of the virus. We will keep the American people fully informed in our findings. Hydroxychloroquine, I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results. I hope that, that would be a phenomenal thing. But we have it right now in, approximately, it’s increased to 1,500 people. I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York, terrific guy by the way, he’s doing a good job. And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it. It’s been there for about three and a half days and many other places it’s being tested, too. And we have a tremendous supply of it. We’ve ordered it in the case that it works, and it could have some pretty big impacts. We’ll see what happens.  My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses. In day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5 billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during this unprecedented time. Bank of America has been incredible. Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks, and we’re already at three point $5 billion going out to incredible people. But that’s way ahead of schedule.  The SBA and the treasury are working around the clock. And our banking partners are really incredible, and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible. And then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go. And now they’ll keep them, and that’s good. Then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees, and we’ll try and get back to where we were. Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.  The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis. This afternoon I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hagar of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicky Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of ExxonMobil. I informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time. There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus. The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil. So we’re working with our great energy companies. These are great companies. They employee tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. They’ve kept America really going for a long time, and no big price hikes, no big anything. I mean, they’ve just kept it going and now they got hit. But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.  America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society. Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time. We want them to stay healthy for a long time, so stay at home. This is ending, this will end. You’ll see some bad things, and then you’re going to see some really good things and it’s not going to be too long.  We will heal our citizens, and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus. And with that I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice-President, say a few words. And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.  It’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C. and our country’s a great place. And we’re getting better, we’re getting better very quickly. This was artificially induced, they said, “Close it down, you have to close it down.” We closed it down and we’re healing, and we’re going to get it better fast. So Mike, if you could come up and say a few words, please. Okay. Let’s go. Steve? I just don’t want to wear one myself. It’s a recommendation. They recommend it. I’m feeling good. I just don’t want to be doing, I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk. I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly.  Now, with that being said, if somebody wants to… I mean most people can just make something out of a certain material, so it’s very well designated. It’s very simple to do. I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation. Okay? Surgeon General, please. Okay. I’d talk to the governors. The governors know what they’re doing, they’ve been doing a great job. I guess we’re close to 90% anyway. The states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy. No, I would leave it to the governors. I like that from the standpoint of governing and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution. I pointed at you. I heard a different voice, I heard a much different voice. We’ll get you later. Well, a lot of things came out. It’s a great industry. It’s an important industry. It’s a tremendous job-producing industry and it’s just vital. It was also a very interesting because they all would get the test before they came into the room. You have the head of ExxonMobil, you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors. That was good. They left happy in that respect, at least. There’s just an overabundance of oil right now. Oil and gas, tremendous overabundance and it was caused… They were doing a great job. They were producing a lot of energy, but then you had the virus come along and it knocked another 35%, maybe 40%, off of the market. There’s too much oil, there’s a glut, and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out. It’s free market. We’ll figure it out. They were having a competition. We’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out very well. It’s going to take a long time to get rid of that. There’s massive excess amount of oil and gas. Massive, like probably there’s never been. Where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers. I think in certain locations, it’s down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon right now on the road. But we have a tremendous industry, a great industry. It’s tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs and we’re energy independent. We have to make sure we keep it that way. All right, please. Didn’t know anything about that. That was done by the FDA. Very capable people at the FDA. I don’t blame them, they can push back if they want. We’re not happy with 3M. We’re not happy, and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M. We’ll see whether or not we do. I heard what he had to say today. I don’t know the gentleman, but we’re not happy with 3M. Go ahead. I don’t know. But every time you asked that question, whenever he’s not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?” And you’ll say, “Is there a problem?” No problem whatsoever. Every time he’s not here. Sometimes I’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the Fake News Establishment ask is, “Where’s Dr. Fauci?” We’re doing great together. We’re covering a different subject today. Go ahead. Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things could happen. There’s been nothing like this since probably 1917, that was the big one in Europe. It started actually here and went to Europe, probably. I’ve heard about… Excuse me. Wait a minute. Let me finish. I’ve heard about this for a long time. Pandemics. You don’t want pandemics. I don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic, he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen. Most people thought it wouldn’t, and most people didn’t understand the severity of it. This is very severe. What’s happened is very severe, but I’d let you answer that. I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic. Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you. You know it. You know the answer. The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty. So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question because the shelves were empty. You know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally, and that was said by one of your favorite generals. Sir, we have no ammunition. Guess what? We had very little medical supply also. All right. Go ahead. We’ll get it back. We’ll get you back. We’ll get you back, please. Jim, I said we’ll get you back. Please go ahead. It covers everything. But if somebody ordered, if Italy, if Spain who has big problems, these are countries with tremendous problems. France, if they ordered, if they have long-term orders and they’re in there and they want to get certain things, I’ve let them go out in certain instances because I think it’s only fair. They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems. So if they ordered something and they’re waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I’m not going to be stopping that. I think it would be very unfair.  By the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today. We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it, and we had tremendous security. We took the sick people, and we’re working with them. We have doctors. We have great doctors, military doctors. From a humane standpoint, not that we’re in love with this, these are two massive ships, but we have to take care of people. We have to take care of them.  We sent many back to Canada. The Canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the UK. We had a lot of people from the UK, and we took care of the Americans. We took care of the sick. We had some people very sick. I think we had three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat, one of the boats actually, and we had to take care of these people. So we could have let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time, and I made the decision we had to take them in. Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job, but we had to help people. These are people that were very, very sick. Some were dying. Some died. Please. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. No, I’m not concerned. No. I had a test yesterday. I don’t know. I mean, I heard from the oil executives. These are people, most of them had not had the test, and frankly I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things, but they felt good about the test. This was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized. They took the test. I don’t know. I didn’t know they were doing that. Maybe they did it just for them. I don’t know. But it seems that a lot of people, because now we have tests that really work well. Abbott, in this case Abbott. We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic. The original tests, the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were broken. They were obsolete. They were not good tests, and that’s what we got stuck with. We’ve developed some incredible tests, but this took 13 to 15 minutes, and they were all fine. Go ahead. Finish your question. Well, I address it in the following manner. We really are very well supplied. We are not the principal. It’s the hospitals, the states, the cities, they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens. But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened. So we started supplying. We brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days. We brought them to Louisiana. We brought them to Michigan. We brought them to Los Angeles. A lot of equipment.  You’ve read the amount of masks that we had. I think I said over 8 million masks. The n95 masks, the more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks, the ones they want to use in the hospitals, we have millions of them now. We’ve given them to a lot. We sent to Bellevue in New York today. That was from Mayor de Blasio? 200,000 of them, but we have 8.1 million.  We’re going to have more than that and we’re getting them from various sources, including the military. We’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s another emergency. Gowns too. We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered. Our people have done an incredible job. Most people have said, and I said this yesterday, governors have said thank you very much. Great job. If they’re a Democrat governor, in some cases, not in all cases at all.  If I said, “Here’s 1000 ventilators. How many do you want?” “We want 1000.” “Here’s 1000. You got them. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to add another 5,000. Is that good?” They said, “Wow, that’s great.” Then if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the president?” “No, he should have given us 10,000.” That’s what’s happening. You know why? Because that’s a standard political answer, and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody’s ever done a job. But we’ve just delivered a lot of masks. We’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear. But you’re talking about a massive number. But as of this morning, people were very, very happy. Steve? No, they didn’t ask for a bailout, no. It was really more of a discussion than asking. We did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved. They had a dispute. They had a competition, but they want to get it resolved. Russia and Saudi Arabia, I think they want to get it- Yeah, I think they want to get it resolved. I think they’re working very hard. I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved. They’re working very hard. Go ahead. What are you asking? What’s that? A got you? I got you. You used the word our. Our, you know what our means? United States of America. That’s what it means. Our. Our. It means the United States of America. Then we take that our, and we distribute it to the states. Not that we have to- Because we need it for the government, and we need it for the federal government. But when the states are in- No to also keep- To keep for our country because the federal government needs it too, not just the states. But out of that, we oftentimes choose. As an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators, and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says our, he’s talking about our country. He’s talking- Excuse me. He’s talking about the federal government. I mean, it’s such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You know what? You ought to be ashamed. It’s such a simple question. He said our, and our means for the country and our means  for the states because the states are part of the country. Don’t make it sound bad. Don’t make it sound bad. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. Back here. You just asked your question. You just asked your question in a very nasty tone. Let’s go. Please. I gave you a perfect answer. You know it. Go ahead. Sure, but it’s also needed for the federal government. We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states were totally unprepared for this. So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we’re not an ordering clerk. They have to have for themselves. Now some of the states were in good shape. Some of the states were not in good shape. That’s probably something you could expect.  We have been helping states. We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have. I mean, take New York. We built them hospitals. I built them four hospitals, built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms. Then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else.  Now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years. They had a chance to order very big, but they didn’t choose to do it. We were there, and we helped them, and I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave. But we have a stockpile. It’s a federal stockpile. We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves. We do use it for the federal government. We have a very big federal government. Go ahead. We’re not a traffic cop. We’re a humanitarian cop. We help. It’s like the ships. Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems? You know the problems I’m talking about. So I have a decision to make. Do I take them in, or do I save lives? Okay? Do I take them in, or do I save? I decided to take them in.  We have tremendous protection. We have great doctors there to help the people. They had four or five people that died. That was as of last night. They died on the ships. We took care of it. Now the people are in the process of, and many are already back in Canada. They’re back in the UK, United Kingdom, and many of them were American citizens. Some were very sick. We’re taking care of the sick people. We’re testing all of the others very, very carefully, very, very carefully. They are being tested like you wouldn’t believe, and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe. You know why? Because nobody else would take the ships. Nobody else would take them. So we docked them in, I think, Fort Lauderdale. We do say that. We say, and we use the act. Excuse me. We do say that, and we use the act. We’ve used it a number of times very powerfully, and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that. Then we also have companies that act incredibly well. We have plenty of them, mostly them, but we’ve used the act very powerfully. A lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act. All you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don’t do this, we’re going to use the act.” We’ve done a good job with it. Maybe a great job. Yeah. No. Me sign? No. There’s millions of checks. I’m going to sign them? No. It’s a Trump administration initiative, but do I want to sign them? No. The people are getting their money. There’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways. There’s also a stimulus going for companies that, if it weren’t for our government, would not and some companies that were very strong a month ago.  Again, we had the strongest economy in the world. We had our best ever. We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody, and one day we have to say, close it up, stop. Everybody, go home. You know what? It’s pretty tough to do that. I don’t know. All I can tell you is that small business today is that we’re way ahead of schedule. There is a problem, which I pointed out, I said you shouldn’t do it this way, with unemployment, where 40 year old equipment by the states. We’re sending the money to the states. Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people. Hopefully they will be able to do it. But many of those states have 40 year old computers. I don’t know that they’re equipped. I wanted to give the money direct if that’s what you’re talking about. I wanted to give the money out direct. It Would have been much easier. But the Democrats and some people said, no, let’s do it the complicated way. All right. Excuse me. I was talking about both. They’ll get it. They will. Go ahead please. It is going to go away. I didn’t say a day. I said it’s going away, and it is going away. Okay. Are you … Okay. That was a good answer to your question. No, no, no, no, no, no more. That was a long but a very good answer. That was enough for you. Yeah, we’re going to do that. We will be talking about that at a different time. Yeah, please go ahead. That’s up to Dr. Birx. You will decide. I’m sure they’ll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci, too. Please. Go ahead. No, they should’ve had more ventilators at the time. They should have had more ventilators. They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do, we’re doing our best for New York. We have states. We have a lot of states. We have territory’s too, but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others. We’ve worked very well with the governor. We happen to think that he’s well-served with ventilators. We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of. We have a big problem in Louisiana. We have a big problem in Michigan.  We have a big problem and seven other really strong hotspots, but we’re doing the best we can. I wish they did the original orders three years ago. They would’ve had all the ventilators they needed, although even then they wouldn’t. Because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard and we’ve supplied a lot. I told you we supplied some just today to New York and we supplied some yesterday to New York City. Did you have one in the back? Yeah, please. I don’t think that was the question. No, he didn’t misspeak. He used the word, our. Okay. Our. Our is referring to our country … The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country. We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country, but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we’re going to need, we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places. That’s all. Of course, we’re not using them anywhere else. We’re not going to be using them, John, anywhere else. But we want the flexibility because we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it. Some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been, you look at the chart. States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be really, they’d done a great job. Some states are really trouble, but you don’t know. You don’t know. We have great flexibility.  I would have preferred giving them all out. We’d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back. So we have tremendous flexibility and it could be New York, it could be Louisiana. Those are two that are really rough. New Jersey is very rough and they’ve done a very good job in New Jersey. But New Jersey is very rough. Go ahead, please. The guidelines relative to which? The masks? I just don’t use them. They’re not mandatory guidelines. They’re guidelines. They suggest you could wear them, don’t have to wear them. In fact, the director is here. If you want to say a couple of words about it, you can if you want. You don’t have to. But basically it’s a voluntary thing. Say it directly. Doing a good job. And I was just tested also, so I assume I don’t have the virus so I don’t have to worry about spreading it. Okay. Please go ahead. I’m always considering. Look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country. I put them on China, I put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us or they have for many years. Look, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years. They’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us. Don’t even like us.  Okay. So this has been going on for years. They terrify us, they create artificial, you could say nonfinancial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers. You can’t sell your product. You can’t take care of our farmers. They won’t take our and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it. Look, they’ve taken advantage of us for years. Tariffs are a way of evening the score. Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing. They have tariffs on us and we now can put tariffs on them. Am I using it for oil? It’s something we can. No.  Am I doing it now? No. Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment? No. But if we’re not treated fairly, it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox. It would be the same thing. No. It would be the same thing. They are having a dispute, the two countries, and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry. Russia’s being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary, that’s where they get most of their income. And this is a price like from the 1950s. Right? It’s a price from the 1950s. They are being hurt very badly. I think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly. Go ahead, please. Well, they haven’t production. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve increased it so much that they’re, so you meant the opposite. Look, well, they’re going to stop because the market. Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop, but they both did the opposite. They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil. Who would have ever thought? You go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil. There’s so much oil. It’s a tribute in a way. But what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market in terms of demand. So there is no demand and this tremendous supply.  So, I mean you saw our numbers where it was down to 20 and down frankly below 20. It was even below 20. It’s an incredible thing, the market, but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it. But I think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly. Okay. Go ahead. I’d talk. If it were important to talk to her, I’d talk to her. If it were important for the American people, I’d talk to her. But other than that, I can have other people talking to her. Look, you ready? Infrastructure is a great thing for me. I think infrastructure for this country, we have an old broken infrastructure. 50 years ago, we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East. We spent, it’s going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East. How stupid was that decision? But they spent it on that and other things.  We’ve got to fix our infrastructure. That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything. We got to fix our infrastructure. And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we’re borrowing at zero. We never had a chance to borrow at zero. Even this country, we never had a chance to borrow at zero. We’re going to borrow. This is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest because this is the time to do it. Steve, one more question. Which one? I have many trajectories for many things. Say it, Steve. What? On what? I’d have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I’d have to ask Deborah. Have the models changed? The models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come away under the models. If professionals did the models, I was never involved in a model, but…at least this is kind of a model…but you know what, hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die, I want much less than that. I want none. But it’s too late for that, but I want very few people relative to what the models are saying. Those are projections. I hope they’re wrong. I hope we’re going to be under those projections. How come you always have two? Why can’t you have one? Every time, I have three questions. I have two questions. Can you give me one instead because there are a couple of other people? Go ahead. The general election will happen on November 3rd. In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media, put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent, brilliant judge. He’s a justice. And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof and because of that, I think they delayed the election. I don’t know. Why didn’t he do it before? He’s doing the right before the election. Excuse me. Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago? All of a sudden, excuse me. All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon, gets delayed now. I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement. His polls, he’s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor comes out, the Democrat governor, by the way, comes out and says, oh, we’re going to move this election. So I don’t know. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re right. No. I think a lot of people cheat with mail in voting. I think people should vote with ID, voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. When you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards. You have your picture and many of them, not all of them, but on many of them, you should have a picture on your for voting. It should be called voter ID. They should have that and it shouldn’t be mail in, excuse me. It shouldn’t be mail in voting.  It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up. All sorts of bad things can happen by the time they sign that, if they sign that, if they sign that, by the time it gets in and it’s tabulated. No, it shouldn’t be mailed in. You should vote at the booth and you should have voter ID. Because when you have voter ID, that’s the real deal. Thank you very much. We’ll see you tomorrow."
"     madam Speaker the president's cabinet  madam Speaker the President of the United States    members of Congress the President of the United States  thank you very much thank you thank you very much madam speaker mr. vice president members of Congress the first lady of the United States and my fellow-citizens three years ago we launched the great American comeback tonight I stand before you

enemies are on the run America's fortunes are on the rise in America's future is blazing bright the years of economic decay are over the days of our country being used taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us Ganju are the broken promises jobless recoveries tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth power and prestige in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americans destiny we have totally rejected the downsizing we're moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been our military is completely rebuilt with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it's not even close our borders are secure our families are flourishing our values are renewed our pride is restored and for all of these reasons I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress the state of our union is stronger than ever before the vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise from the instant I took office I moved rapidly to revive the US economy slashing a record number of job-killing regulations enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker pro-family pro-growth and most of all pro-american thank you we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race color religion and Creed very very high since my election we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century and very incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any Administration in the history of our country if we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success the unemployment rate for african-americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history african-american youth unemployment has reached an all-time low african-american poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all-time low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in US history a record number of young Americans are now employed under the last administration more than 10 million people were added to the Food Stamp rolls under my administration seven million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare in eight years under the last administration over 300,000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration 3.5 million people working age people have joined the workforce since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top one percent after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low-income workers who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election this is a blue-collar boom real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded since my election US stock markets have soared 70% adding more than 12 trillion dollars to our nation's wealth transcending anything anyone believed was possible this is a record it is something that every country in the world is looking up to they admire consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs all of those millions of people with 401ks and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and 100% and even more jobs and investments are pouring in to nine thousand previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones a plan spearheaded by senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts in other words wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades creating jobs energy and excitement this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this it's all working Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran tony Rankin's from Cincinnati Ohio after struggling with drug addiction Tony lost his job his house and his family he was homeless but then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones he is now a top tradesman drug free reunited with his family and he is here tonight Tony keep up the great work Tony thank you Tony our roaring economy has for the first time ever given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start the second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done but I got it done and the people in this room got it done  thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the United States has become the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years America is now energy independent and energy jobs like so many other elements of our country are at a record high we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago likewise we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might even though predictions were as you all know that this could never ever be done after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built companies are not leaving they are coming back to the USA the fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is in the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is one of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal in fact unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for president following NAFTA's adoption our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace NAFTA only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened but unlike so many who came before me I keep my promises we did our job six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new US mexico canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying american auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers ranchers and factory workers it will also bring trade with mexico and canada to a much higher level but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity we will have that fairness and reciprocity and I say that finally because it's been many many years that we were treated fairly on trade this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs our strategy has worked days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA for decades China has taken advantage of the United States now we have changed that but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China including with President Xi they respect what we've done because quite frankly they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year decade after decade without someone in our country stepping up and saying that's enough now we want to rebuild our country and that's exactly what we're doing we are rebuilding our country as we restore American leadership throughout the world we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere that's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba we are supporting the hopes of Cubans Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to restore democracy the United States is leading a 59 Nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro Maduro is an illegitimate ruler a tyrant who brutalizes his people but medoras grip and tyranny will be smashed and broken here this evening it's a very brave man who carries with him the hopes dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of Venezuela juan guido mr. president please take this message back to you Thank You mr. president great honor thank you very much please take this message back heck that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom thank you very much mister thank you very much socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul to safeguard American liberty we have invested a record-breaking 2.2 trillion dollars in the United States military  we have purchased the finest planes missiles rocket ships in every other form of military equipment and it's all made right here in the USA we are also getting our allies finally to help pay their fair share I have raised contributions from other NATO members by more than 400 billion dollars and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled and just weeks ago for the first time since President Truman established the air force more than 70 years earlier we created a brand new branch of the United States Armed Forces it's called the space force very important in the gallery tonight we have a young gentleman and what he wants so badly 13 years old in lawn Faye he's an eighth grader from Arizona Ian please stand up ian has always dreamed of going to space he was the first of his class and among the youngest at an Aviation Academy he aspires to go to the Air Force Academy and then he has his eye on the space force as Ian says most people look up at space I want to look down on the world but sitting behind Ian tonight is his greatest hero of them all Charles Magee was born in Cleveland Ohio one century ago Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be Ian's great-grandfather  credible story after more than 130 combat missions in World War two he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam on December 7th Charles celebrated his 100th birthday a few weeks ago a signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General and earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office general McGee our nation salutes you thank you sir from the pilgrims to the founders from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future members of Congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people the people are the heart of our country their dreams are the soul of our country and their love is what powers and sustains their country we must always remember that our job is to put America first the next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American dream yet for too long countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools to rescue these students 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships the programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list one of those students is Jenaya davis a fourth grader from philadelphia Jenaya geneious mom Stephanie is a single parent she would do anything to give her daughter a better future but last year that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children Jenna and Stephanie are in the gallery Stephanie thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter thank you very much but Jenai I have some good news for you because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over I can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available it's going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice now I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity janilla has just received passed the education freedom scholarships and opportunities act because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow for this reason our magnificent first lady has launched the b-best initiative to advance a safe healthy supportive and drug-free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities Thank You Melania for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children thank you very much my administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to American workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans my budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation's high schools tonight I ask Congress to support our students and backed my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America to expand equal opportunity I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation's historically black colleges and universities a good life for American families also requires the most affordable innovative and high quality health care system on earth before I took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years I move quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better I've also made an ironclad pledge to American families we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions and we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security always the American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills that is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency many experts believe that transparency which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than health care reform it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care but as we work to improve Americans health care there are those who want to take away your health care take away your doctor and abolish private insurance entirely 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans to those watching at home tonight I want you to know we will never let socialism destroy American health care over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders these proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration that is what is happening in California and other states their systems are totally out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money if forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you then stand with the radical left but if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government health care for illegal aliens this will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed my administration has also taken on the big pharmaceutical companies we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before and I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the costs of prescription drugs actually went down and working together Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices get a bill on my desk and I will sign it into law immediately with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years among the state's hardest hit Ohio is down 22% Pennsylvania is down 18% Wisconsin is down 10% and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all protecting Americans health also means fighting infectious diseases we are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the corona virus outbreak in China my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat we have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease Alzheimer's and those struggling with mental health and because Congress were so good as to fund my request new cures for childhood cancer and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness here tonight is a special man beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage four advanced cancer diagnosis this is not good news but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet rush limbaugh thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country and rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor the Presidential Medal of Freedom I will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor please  ruch and catherine congratulations Thank You Catherine as we pray for all who are sick we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs in 2017 doctors at Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive born at just 21 weeks in six days and weighing less than a pound ellie schneider was a born fighter through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents little ellie kept on winning the battle of life today Ellie is a strong healthy two-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the gallery Ellie and Robin we are glad to have you with us tonight le reminds us that every child is a miracle of life and thanks to modern medical wonders 50% of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where le was born now survived it's an incredible thing thank you very much our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like le that is why I'm asking Congress to provide an additional 50 million dollars to fund neonatal research for America's youngest patients that is why I'm also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies whether we are Republican Democrat or independent surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God as we support America's moms and dads I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave serving as a model for the rest of the country now I call on Congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families Act extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation 40 million American families have an average 2200 dollars extra thanks to our child tax credit I've also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare enabling 17 states to help more children many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether and I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately to protect the environment days ago I announced that the United States will join the 1 trillion trees initiative an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world we must also rebuild America's infrastructure I asked you to pass senator john burroughs highway bill to invest in new roads bridges and tunnels all across our land I'm also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed Internet including and especially in rural America they better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe that means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level including our nation's heroic ice officers last year our brave vice officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries 5,000 sexual assaults 45,000 violent assaults and 2,000 murders tragically there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens in sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed just 29 days ago a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman the killer had been previously arrested for assault but under New York sanctuary policies he was set free if the city had honored ices detainer request his victim would still be alive today the state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sting January for criminal illegal immigrants a very terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results here is just one tragic example in December 2018 California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests including convictions for robbery and assault but as required by California sanctuary law local authorities released him days later the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence he viciously shot one man going about his daily work he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon he hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles critically injuring innocent victims one of the victims is a terrible terrible situation died fifty one-year-old American named rocky Jones rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him in cold blood rocky left behind a devoted family including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight Jodie would you please stand Jodie thank you Jodee our hearts weep for your loss and we will not rest until you have justice senator Tom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jodi to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices I asked Congress to pass the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act immediately the United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not criminal aliens in the last three years Isis arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers and I have side nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the Menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe my administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States before I came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed from our country very importantly we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75% since May dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall rapidly goes up drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly last year I traveled to the border in Texas and met chief patrol agent Raul Ortiz for months agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2,000 migrants days ago agent Ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of Border Patrol and he joins us tonight chief Ortiz please stand a grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of border patrol and ice thank you very much to build on these historic gains we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit welcoming those who follow the rules contribute to our economy support themselves financially and uphold our values with every action my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thank You Mitch and his colleagues in the Senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written this includes two brilliant new Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh thank you and we have many in the pipeline my administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools in America we don't punish prayer we don't tear down crosses we don't ban symbols to faiths we don't muzzle preachers and pastors in America we celebrate faith we cherish religion we lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of God just as we believed in the First Amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as I am president I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms in reaffirming our heritage as a free nation we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation now we must embrace the next frontier America's manifest destiny and the Stars I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars my administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism last week I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians recognizing that all past attempts have failed we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future three years ago the barbarians of Isis held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria today the ISIS territorial Caliphate has been 100% destroyed and the founder and leader of Isis the bloodthirsty killer known as al Baghdadi is dead we are joined

when we hit him very hard and that's why last month at my direction the US military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Salamone and terminated his evil reign of terror forever our message to the terrorists is clear you will never escape American justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life in recent months we have seen proud Iranian 'he's raised their voices against their oppressive rulers the Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons stop spreading terror death and destruction and start working for the good of its own people because of our powerful sanctions the Iranian economy is doing very very poorly we can help them make a very good and short time recovery it can all go very quickly but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help we are here let's see which road they choose it is totally up to them as we defend American lives we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East in Afghanistan the determination and valor of our war fighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress in peace talks are now underway I am NOT looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan many of them totally innocent it is also not our function to serve other nations as law-enforcement agencies these are war fighters that we have the best in the world and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all we are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home war places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families especially spouses like

thousands of hardworking American patrons who believed in faith family God and country thank you it's a phenomenal crowd only topped by the number of people outside that didn't get if anybody would like to give up where you're standing or your seat please raise your hand now let's begin right thank you all very much oh this is great no they don't get it you know down the road they have a rally for to the people that are going to be running tomorrow they're trying to get to a hundred but they're not gonna make it so I think they're gonna set up a round table you know that's what they do they said so people want to go to a rally they end up sitting at a round table talking about the definition of impeachment crazy crazy it's a crazy deal no the to fake news media they've been trying to figure this out for years they still don't get it though they don't get it look at all of those cameras look at all of those guys that's a lot of cameras that's a lot of cameras Lindsay and Tim that's a lot of kid they heard you guys were here they heard Tim was here and that Lindsay was here and then and they said we're not going to attend that rally but you know when we heard those two guys plus our great congressman okay here great congressman but this is an incredible time for our nation we're thrilled to be in the midst of what we call the great American comeback in this one jobs a booming income Sasori factories are returning poverty is plummeting confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military our country is stronger than ever before we are stronger we are better but while we're building a great future the radical left Democrats in Washington are trying to burn it all down they have spent the last three years and I could even go further than that three years since the election but we go before the election working to erase your ballots and overthrow our democracy but with your help we have exposed the far left corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let's see what happens in the coming months let's watch very dishonest people now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus you know that  they are politicizing it we did one of the great jobs you say how's president Trump doing they go oh not good they have no clue they don't have any clue they can't even count their votes in Iowa they can't even they can't count their votes one of my people came up to me and said mr. president they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia that didn't work out too well they couldn't do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything they tried it over and over they've been doing it since she got in it's all turning they lost it's all turning think of it think of it and this is their new hoax but you know we did something that's been pretty amazing we're 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that we're doing great our country is doing so great we are so unified the Republican Party has never ever been unified like it is now there has never been a movement in the history of our country like we have now never been a movie so a statistic that we want to talk about go ahead say USA it's okay us  so a number that nobody heard of that I heard of recently and I was shocked to hear 35,000 people or an average die each year from the flu did anyone know that 35,000 that's a lot of people it could go to a hundred thousand it could be 27,000 they say usually a minimum of 27 goes up to a hundred thousand people a year die and so far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States no bother and it doesn't mean we won't and we are totally prepared it doesn't mean we won't but think of it you hear thirty five and forty thousand people and we've lost nobody and you wonder the press is in hysteria mode CNN fake news and the camera just went off  the camera just went off turn it back on hey by the way hold it look look at this and honestly all events are like this it's about us it's all about us I wish they'd take the camera show the arena please show them if they never they never do  they never show the arena you can hear it because when you hear it that's not 200 people that set a hundred people that's thousands and thousands of people including people they always show my face see that face they show my face I wanted to show the arena not my face right how many have you been to how many rallies have you good practically everyone can you believe it I'm sure your husband's are thrilled right they're thrilled where are you going tonight I'm going to another Trump rally number 114 what do your husband say about that this group of big she said we don't care thank you thank you Democrats will only say horrible things even though they know we're doing a great job we do it a great job with what we have to work with it you've gotta for the Democrats want us to fail so badly even if their actions and you take a look hurt the people of this country they'll hurt the people themselves their wealth their everything they're willing to hurt our country in order to say bad even if they know it's not so we made an unbelievable deal with Mexico with Canada with China with South Korea with Japan and if you put a microphone that these people back there like the Academy Awards used to be done anymore best best movie of the year it's made in South Korea what's that all about festival I'm waiting to see the best movie of the year and it's made he sent his garbage only in South Carolina can you say Oh you're gonna get us in trouble now I'm just repeating what he said for the fake snooze I'm just now but seriously you know the Academy Awards has gone way way down in ratings you know why because they started attacking us and we don't believe in it anymore that's now but they had the best movie of the year made in South Korea they make enough stuff for us right and they're good they're our friends take advantage of us that's okay not so much anymore we are mek differently we are really you take a look magnificently organized with the best professionals in the world we're prepared for the absolute worst you have to be prepared for the worst but hopefully it will all amount to very little that's why I tell you when we have the flu at 35,000 people and this one is we have to take it very very seriously that's what we're doing we are preparing for the worst my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to prevent the spread of this illness in the United States we are ready we are ready  On January 31st I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States an action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested and now everybody's complimenting me saying thank you very much you were a hundred percent correct could have been a whole different story but I say so let's get this right a virus starts in China bleeds its way into various countries all around the world doesn't spread widely at all in the United States because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the Democrats single point talking point and you see it is that it's Donald Trump's fault right miss Donald now just things that happen but you know what this does show you things happen whoever thought of this two weeks ago who would have thought this could be going on for weeks ago you wouldn't but things happen in life and you have to be prepared and you have to be flexible and you have to be able to go out and get it and my guys that we have the best professionals in the world the best in the world and we are so ready at the same time that I initiated the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years we had a quarantine some people they weren't happy they weren't happy about it I want to tell you there are a lot of people that not so happy but after two weeks they got happy you know who got happy the people around them got happy that's who got I also created a white house virus task force it's a big thing the virus task force I requested 2.5 billion dollars to ensure we have the resources we need the Democrats said that's terrible he's doing the wrong thing he needs eight and a half billion not two and a half I've never had that before he has for two and a half they want to give me eight to have so I said I'll take it does that make me a bit I'll take it I'll take them I never had that beautiful I never had it we won two and a half million that's plenty we demand you take eight and a half he doesn't know what he's doing we want a to half these people are crazy we must understand that border security is also health security  and you've all seen the wall is going up like magic it's going up like magic you think that was an easy one that was not an easy one it's going up great and it's we're up now 132 miles and this is the exact wall that border security wanted everything this is everything they wanted 132 miles already we'll have 500 miles built by very early next year sometimes one of the reasons the numbers are so good we will do everything in our power to keep the infection and those carrying the infection from entering our country we have no choice whether it's the virus that we're talking about or many other public health threats the Democrat policy of open borders is a direct threat to the health and well-being of all Americans now you see it with the coronavirus you see it you see it with the corona boy you know you see that when you have this virus or any other virus or any other problem coming in it's not the only thing that comes in through the border and we're setting records now at the border we're setting records and now just using this so important right so important I'm doing well in the polls despite the worst fake news and worst presidential harassment in the history of the United we've got phenomenal numbers now it's the worst presidential harassment in history we had a great event yesterday a an event that was so beautiful young african-american leaders one of the things I asked him and I've been thinking about this for a long time and great people great people some of them are here tonight do you like the name african-american or black and they said black all at the same time no true I tell you because you say african-american are black and they said almost like immediately black but we had an incredible group of people and what happened is NBC it was such a love fest it was selling crab went on for 45 minutes it was a love fest it was incredible NBC turned out there they are right there they turned down Comcast which owns NBC actually NBC I think which is we call it MS DNC right MS DNC but NBC I think is worse than CNN I actually do and Comcast a company that spends millions and millions of dollars on their image I'll do everything possible to destroy their image because they are they are terrible they're a terrible group of people and they paid me a fortune four years for the apprentice they paid me a fortune and when I left the show is doing great when I left the show 14 seasons think of that he got a big movie star won't tell you his name nobody would know actually nobody will know his name because he was on for such a short period of time but the show went down the tubes very quickly after the head chopped but the country in five years from now of course you'll want to upset him five years or nine years or 13 years or 18 years  10 more years now now or they go crazy when you say it when you say when you say to them five more years so it's fine but you then say maybe nine maybe 13 maybe 17 maybe 21 who knows maybe let's do this let's term limit ourselves at 25 years no more than 25 no more okay they'll pass something in the Senate Tim pass it in the Senate with Lindsey a 25 year term limit please now we're looking to do a great job we need that extra five to get everything solidified you know it's like you take a tree and you plant it it needs some time to grab on right and that's all we need we've got incredible things that we've done we have things we still can do but we have done actually much much more than we even promised we do if you think while the extreme left has been wasting America's time with these vile hoaxes we've been killing terrorists creating jobs raising wages and acting frayed Trevor Fairtrade is securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race religion color and Creed we added another 225,000 jobs last month alone and that makes seven million jobs since our election seven million the unemployment rate in the great state of South Carolina you ever hear that plan now sleepy Joe would say the unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio no no you're in South Carolina Joe Joe you're in south to come up and you ever see the guy the note no no it's South Carolina it's not Ohio okay then he goes alright Iowa did you say I wouldn't no no I did that like seven times if I did that once it would be the end of the road right be the end of it they'd say Trump is lost it they like to say that anyway I guess huh these people are bad people sleepy Joe well he's running tomorrow no but could you imagine if I said just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes which are unbeliever speech I actually said the other night I was watching him when he said about half the population wiped out with guns I said I said that's a horrible thing that's the end of his evening that's the end of his political career and that after the debate they're revealing him they said Joe Biden had a great night last night I don't get it Kim the unemployment rate here in South Carolina has fallen to 2.3 percent the lowest rate in your States the lowest rate in all of America the lowest rate in all of America I said to a friend of mine a Democrat how's the race going tomorrow who's gonna win and he says mr. president now it's very interesting you know he said something he's this guy's a real political Pro - in all fairness even though he's a Democrat but I said who's gonna win he said honestly sir it doesn't matter you are so far ahead in South Carolina that it's meaningless and in North Carolina - in North Carolina we've destroyed the ISIS territorial Caliphate we killed the founder and leader of Isis al Baghdadi is dead he's dead he's dead and we recently took out the world's top terrorists Kazaam so limini ending his evil reign of terror forever  but as we keep on winning Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds they've gone crazy I mean nervous Nancy crying Chuck Schumer crying Chuck a bunch of losers the good citizens of South Carolina have had a front row seat to the extremism of the Democrat candidates whether it's his character that nobody ever heard of him I never heard I thought I knew all the wealthy people this guy Tom said mr. impeachment how did that work out Tom hey he spent millions and millions of dollars in Iowa right Millions he got less than 1% he got like 1/3 of 1% I I wrote a little note did you see it it said Tom it's not so easy doing what I did is it not so easy that's all you have to do is ask many Mike he's in there for a fortune oh yeah he'll he wish he never started he wished he'd never many Mike he wish he never started he said well Trump can do it I'm gonna do it too unfortunately it's not working out too well was that the worst debate performance in history I turned on cuz that you know they had a big audience everybody wanted to see whether or not he was good at what was supposed to be doing up here he turned out to be a total catastrophe that 35 million people can you believe that's a big audience very big and what a killer but this guy steyr he spends all this money he's not that wealthy he spends all of this money and you shouldn't waste your vote on him tomorrow have to be honest the people by the way the Republicans allowed to vote anyway either them are you ready are you ready let's do it together I assume this is okay from a campaign finance standpoint I assume Lindsay Tim our great congressmen are we allowed to do so am I allowed to request first we have to figure out who would be the weakest candidate against president  and then if it's legal I always say if it's permissible by law because they have so many little booby traps but they only like getting the Republicans Democrats skirt right but we'll see what happens about that the Democrats but let me ask you this Lindsay Tim you're pros these are two of the greatest guys I know so let me ask you this so I don't know what the record attendance is in this arena but I was told that we broke it by a lot and you get the people outside are we allowed to tell them who we would like them to vote for cuz you're allowed to skip all right so wait a minute let's do a poll we do this for the fake news back there ready who would be the best candidate for us not for them we're ready ready so let's go through them just quickly we won't include steyr cuz he's a loser he's out we wanted to who would be the best with this is a real pump this isn't one of those fake polls taken by in all fairness I Love You Fox taken by Fox the worst pollster this guy this pulsar hates Trump's guts I was losing the last election by a fortune they said he did great with women what everything was wrong and they never replaced this guy but but watch this you ready so first we'll go let's say sleepy Joe right so right that will go crazy birdy then will go mini Mike I don't think mini Mike I think he's out of it should we include mini mica or not mini mike is gone mini Mike his gun I think he's gone he doesn't have a chance so let's not talk and he's not in your election anyway so let's forget so many Mike I hear mini Mike by the way has left he's basically given up that's what I hear he gave up he gave up now I hope what I just said keeps him in you know he's the kind of a guy he he'll stay in because I don't want to be wrong Mike it's time to go home go home Mike and enjoy your life go home and spend some money on something so let's just go we'll go because okay do you agree we'll go for the two look Pocahontas we could forget about her  Pocahontas I came out with that name far too early because those Bernie Amber's they got you know little M's you got soda horrible two people and they said you know she's not done but she's just so damn mean we can't vote for her she's a mean one she is mean so Pocahontas should we leave her in around how about Klobuchar not gonna happen so really we're down to two candidates right sleepy Joe Biden and crazy Bernie so this is appalled I guarantee this as much as they hate me they hate me they'll gonna put this all over the place we have a pall of like 30,000 people inside and out they're doing it outside too we have a poll are you ready who do I so in other words who's the weaker of the two I'm not interested in who those better no no I'm not interested wait so ready in other words who do I want to run against meaning meaning very simple we put it into nice simple language who the hell is easier to be right so who is easier for us not me for us to be ready crazy Bernie or sleepy Joan I don't know I think maybe crazy Bernie has it a little bit but once more just quick ready Kray he said it doesn't matter you're beautiful I hope so I hope so so who is easier to be crazy birdie or sleepy Joe they think bernie is easier to be they think Bernie's into the pit so whether it's Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private health care Elizabeth Warren's plan I told you that I had more Indian blood in me than her even though I have none I have done zero I have none I have none I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has and she choked she said I'm gonna show up in ownership she hired this company and they went out and did a blood test 1024 3 so that means I probably won somewhere down the line a million years ago I'm telling you that was horrible she choked we don't want a person to win the chokes we don't want to choke artists right one thing you will say about me I'm not a choker with all these people for years they're after me for you can have chokers we can't have chokers as your president so Elizabeth Warren's plan to eliminate America's borders and that's what you or Minnie Mike's plan to eliminate your Second Amendment and take away your guns up many Mike wants to take away you go the insanity of the Democrat Party is wide millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement they are joining our great new Republican Party this November we are going to take back the house we are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House I wonder what they say when they go down the road and they see these groups of 200 people seriously I wonder what they say they never talk about they'll say Joe Biden had a fabulous crowd today fabulous so fabulous that there's like five people and they'll leave and they'll say President Trump had a smattering of   s'matter they use the word smattering a lot this is not let's let them hear it this is not a smash this is a big this is not his style turn the camera that's not a smell  that is not a smattering I hate it they say Donald Trump you know in India I hate to say this to you but so they actually have a hundred and twenty nine thousand seat stadium did you say it the place was packed and they did better than most they gave me credit for a hundred thousand that was not bad it's a hundred and twenty nine the stadium halls a hundred and if they had a field that's about three times its Cricket it's the biggest stadium and they'd 129 I was with the Prime Minister of India Modi great guy loved by the people of India and we had an amazing thing and I went in and here's the problem this is a big crowd and normally I like talking about my crowds because I get the crowds like nobody but I just got back from a hundred and forty or fifty or sixty thousand people and now I'm coming here what is this place hold fifteen it's hard to be enthused you understand that I may never be excited again about a crowd after going to India but they have think of this they have 1.5 billion people we have 350 so we're doing pretty well I'll tell you what but I love this crowd and I love that crowd to tell you they have a great love for they have a great love they have a great leader and they have a great love for the people of this country were that was really a worthwhile trip with us tonight are both of your incredible US senators two incredible friends two warriors Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott come up  and by the way Tim's incredible mother is right here in the front row you know as they're doing that they got this beginners good almost do a poll in the two of them but we're not doing this but Lindsey is a true fighter for South Carolina loves the estate and as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he said you know that right he's the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee so important so important senator Graham has been leading the charge to help us confirm a record number of judges to uphold the Constitution Israel and Lindsey was amazing you remember for justice Brett Kavanaugh remember how badly great job Lindsay great job there Thank You senators Scott is a leading superstar he's a superstar but he is a leader in lowering health care costs like nobody has done it you know people don't know but in the last year prescription drug prices came down for the first time in 51 years and that was with no Democrat help if we had their help we could lower it by 50% but we'll get their help one of these days they're gonna get smart senator scott provides world-class care for our veterans what he's done for our veteran veterans is incredible and bringing investment to distressed communities across our country through Opportunity Zones including 135 right here in South Carolina and that's what it is Tim Scott came to my office with an idea he said opportunities and I said to him what the hell is that what is it right Tim and he went through a whole big thing and I said this baby could work and we tried it it is an incredible success and what he's done for this country isn't viable it's incredible Lindsay won't start with Lindsay say a few words please welcome to South Carolina miss Brendan you know when you're gonna win you've been a damn good rosin thank you for 200 conservative judges thank you for justice Cavanaugh and justice Korsak thank you for rebuilding the military and killing the terrorists thank you for the strongest economy of my lifetime and thank you more than anything else for putting up with the neverending you have to go through all right USA USA USA USA USA if if South Carolina I said if South Carolina is Trump country let me hear you speak  if you have if you have benefited from the Trump economy let me hear you scream  okay what what one last thing one last thing one last thing if you want four more years of president  well that was quite a display wasn't it now there's a lot of love in this a lot of people said to me friends of mine they're very successful they say how do you speak in front of 25,000 people and 10,000 people and all of this you know why there's such love in the room it's easy no it's true there is such I explained they don't understand it because they're not for doing that but I say there is such unbelievable love in the room that it's easy to do it's sort of easy to do we're all so thrilled to be joined by many more great leaders from across the state and as some of you may be know I like this guy for a long time governor Henry McMaster come up and come up representatives Joe Wilson Jeff Duncan William Timmons Ralph Norman Tom Rice and the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party through McKissack  and as I introduced somebody and I'll just say stay there cuz he was brave but he got hit hard he's a very special man retired Marine Corps Major General and most of you know he received the Congressional Medal of Honor James E Livingston and James just relax where's Joe he got hit hard thank you James Congressional Medal of Honor winner thank you James they are great brave people you know we have the Congressional Medal of Honor and we have the Presidential Medal of Freedom and they're both the highest awards one civilian one is military and I always say getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom is much less painful because when I read them off I'll read like with James or with so many of the Congressional Medal of Honor as many are not living to be honest with you and I'll read stories where one of them recently going up a hill hit 19 times by gunfire grabbing four people bringing him down getting onto a helicopter falling out of the helicopter hitting a tree on the way down hitting a tree they went back and saved him but he died later I mean those are tough deals those are tough deal and we have one right here whose living we have one right here who's living but they are tough so thank you very much for being here and maybe I could ask our governor our great governor of this incredible state to say a few words please Henry  who is the greatest president in the whole world whom we love more than anybody in the world and what is the name of the president who loves you and whom illegal send back to the White House for four more glorious years and what is the greatest country on the face of the earth thank you

are now working on things that nobody ever thought possible since my election over 121 thousand new jobs have been created right here in South Carolina we've lifted 10 million people off welfare including 7 million off of food stamps and that's a good thing got a bad thing they're working and they have great jobs and they love getting up in the morning and they're making much more money and it costs our country nothing we make money they pay taxes it's a whole different deal median household income has reached the highest level in the history of our country the unemployment rate nationwide has hit the lowest rate in over 50 years the average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history about that one that's a good the unemployment rate among African Americans Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached record lows black youth unemployment has reached an all-time low black poverty levels are the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country for decades Democrat politicians betrayed african-americans they force their children into failing schools they ship their jobs to foreign countries they push their unfair sentencing policies you know about that Alice you know Alice and they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents you know that that's been happening for a long my administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record games for African Americans we are going to compete for every single vote in 2020 and we expect to win a historic share of the black vote come election day we are supporting working families by fighting paid we got something that nobody thought could happen paid family leave reducing the cost of child care and giving 40 million American families an average of 2200 dollars more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit Republican not Democrat we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies that decimated manufacturing all across your state and all across our country for years politicians sold you out to global special interests enriching other countries at your expense that ended that ended but I am not the president of the globe I don't want to be the president of the world I am the president of the United States of America last month we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand-new US Mexico Canada agreement into law the u.s. MCA is a tremendous giant beautiful victory for South Carolina farmers ranchers manufacturers all across the state nothing like it what you had to go through with NAFTA everybody was leaving it was a disgrace that was ever signed you know it better than anybody you had those empty hulks all over the all over the country all over this state all around the world we are demanding trade that is fair and my all-time favorite word reciprocal reciprocal got it before after years of building up other countries we are finally rebuilding our country we are finally putting America first on Noah's you have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than the issue of immigration every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens funded by you the American tax they want to treat illegal aliens people that come into our country illegally better than they want to treat our military and our veterans not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury but it threatens innocent lives I recently invited to the White House the granddaughter of a 92 year old woman who was raped beaten brutalized and murdered by an illegal alien who had previously been set free in New York City here in Charleston County an illegal alien was recently charged with sexually assaulting a young girl in the fourth grade in Berkeley County officers captured a previously deported ms-13 gang member who shot a man to death before dousing the body in gasoline and setting him on fire and he should have never been in our country he shouldn't have loud he shouldn't have been allowed  it's been built and by the way just in case you haven't heard it is being built and that you know and you know they're gonna go nuts they're gonna go nuts they thought they got me you know they said okay have you heard him recently okay he's building the wall and you think it's easy getting that kind of money to build a wall when I have a whole party and a deep state and some never Trump is there a dying breed though the good thing they're on respirator they're on Rose there are mouths to mouth resuscitation you can do it I'm not doing it there are mouth-to-mouth resuscitation the never Trump errs but you think it's easy it's not but that's been built but you know what they say now okay he's building the wall but Mexico's not paying for it yes they are I actually they are they are they are paying for and some of the fake news knows that but their reviews are reported but that's okay you'll see you'll see what's going on and I want to thank Mexico because by the way right now they have 27,000 soldiers on our border protecting our border we have Mexico protected and they only do that for Trump they don't do that for sleepy Joe they don't do that for crazy Bernie and they don't do it for mini Mike that's for sure they're only doing that for Trump right only 27,000 soldiers protecting our border in this region of the country alone last year I saw they've been treated so badly right they are great they're brave they're tough any men two tough guys in here but anybody want to be a nice officer it's tough stuff right they go into those nests they call them nests that's where these guys are together and they knocked the hell I mean if they have to I have to be very careful I don't want to get them in trouble because the press wants us to be very politically correct so so let me change it around they go into a nest of ms-13 and they say oh hello gentlemen how are you and on occasion they have a fight they never lose those fights we need people like that hello gentlemen how are you how many people did you kill last year how many people did you kill last year with a knife because they like knives because it's more painful this is the kind of people that we were letting into our country ice has taken them out of our country by the thousands by the thousand last year ice officers arrested 12 thousand criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery rape and many for a thing called murderer on Wednesday we won the big case in federal court did you see that  we won the case unanimously unanimously federal appeals court where we don't have to give money to sanctuary cities and states if they don't work with us fighting finally finally why should we yet the Democrat candidates oppose all detention of illegal aliens they want unfettered catch-and-release we have ended that program it was not easy we have to go through courts everything as a court everything is a suit we do anything we turn to the right they sue as we turn to the left they sue us we win so but we're winning you know that we have 218 judges now it's like good and let me just preface that by saying I know they give fair opinions it bears no relationship to who appoints them but I never win with an Obama appointed judge ever I don't win now we have great judges going on to the courts great judges they're fair judges they're judges that truly love our Constitution  and their judges that if we feel it's right they don't want to invite the world to trespass across our borders very simple the Democrat field also supports deadly sanctuary cities that release violent criminal aliens you know that you've been reading you all you have to do is pick up a paper every day they release these horrible criminals to terrorize their communities we don't do that anymore we won't let it happen and now we don't have to give sanctuary cities and states the money that they're gonna want it's a whole game change and they don't even want to report it I don't know I didn't see much they keep talking about the virus are the viruses Trump doing a good job oh I don't think so I don't think so Chuckie Schumer no I don't think he's sort of good job this guy doesn't know he's alive Oh what bad people Republicans believe America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans not for criminal alien thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border we have reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75 percent since last spring and we have ended catch and release permanently you know what catching releases we catch him we grab them we say could we please have your address address I don't know what the hell is that address they don't have an address could we have a number Java phone could we call your mother or your father and say in four years you have to come to court so what they do is they catch them they get some information that the guy has no idea where he lives and you know it's one of those things in many cases and then release we release them into our country we don't do that anymore and if you knew what it took we catch them and we take some information and we release them in and we say please report back in four years from now for your trial and about two percent come back and they're the ones that are the dumbest people I've ever seen two percent nobody comes back it's crazy but we're getting it changed and it would be so easy they called loopholes little pulse that word alone they called loopholes it would be so easy if we had some Democrat support we don't have any Democrat support they want open borders they don't care about crime Border Patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics ever in the history of our country this last year we have deported record numbers of gang members we are building the wall faster than ever and we will soon be building more than one mile a day Washington Democrats have never been more extreme 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders health care takeover they want to take away you health care while the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your health care and to destroy your Social Security that's what's going to happen my administration is protecting your Social Security your Medicare and is fighting to give you great health care and we are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan of choice you remember when President Obama would say you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan 28 times he said you can keep your doctor and you can keep your plan while he lied we should impeach him we should impeach him for that he lied 28 times you'll keep your doctor keep your plan it's wonderful Gregg went through the roof we're doing a great job we killed the individual mandate which is the most unbelievable horrible and it's not really Obamacare anymore but we're running the Hulk of it and we're trying to kill it entirely and then we will put it back you'll have great health care and pre-existing conditions will be totally protected pre-existing conditions will be totally protected we're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office we are now offering plans already that are up to 60% less expensive than the old Obamacare think of that and better and better we are stopping surprised medical billing a disgrace and I signed an executive order imposing price transparency because when providers are required to show their prices which they don't have to do but now they do those same prices fall very very fast we have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs which are just as good as the name-brand drugs but at a tiny fraction of the cost they're just as good I always like a name-brand I mean there's something that there's no difference probably sometimes they're better we've totally transformed veteran's health care getting long-sword VA choice and VA accountability passed after 50 years and hopefully nobody in this great arena needs it but we have passed something that they said couldn't happen the spectacular right to try you know what that is if you're terminally ill you go all over the world if you have no money you can't you go home and you die you terminally ill they go all over the world if they have money they go to Asia they go to Europe they wanted they're searching we have the greatest doctors in the world the greatest labs and the world greatest technicians in the world and we have pipelines of drugs coming out for different problems and now you sign a piece of paper we're not gonna hold anybody liable you get to use that drug and the results have been unbelievable I'm believing hopefully you don't need but now we have right to try they've been trying for 51 years to get that approved 51 years and we got it approved I guess I'm good at getting things approved aren't I those people that I brought up here were the reason to every one of them they were incredible thank you thank you Senators Congressmen they were the reasons we are combating the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly thirty two years and we have launched new initiatives combating kidney disease which is a big deal you know kidney disease is so tough that people die literally because it's so much work they died from overwork it's it's just crazy in theory they could keep them going for a long time but the work and the dialysis and all of the things they have to do and we've done things that make it so much easier and it's just such an honor to be involved and also Alzheimer's disease we're really making strides it's really a great thing we're pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing virtually every Democrat candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion ripping baby straight from the mother's womb right up until the very moment of birth that is why I've asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God the Democrat Party is the party of high taxes high crime open borders late term abortion socialism blatant corruption and the total obliteration of your Second Amendment the Republican Party is the party of the American worker the American family the American Dream and of course the late great Abraham Lincoln  Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background every community and every walk of life we are the party of boundless optimism excitement energy and enthusiasm we are a big tent we are a big party we are the party of big ideas for the future this is where it is this is where is this is not the old Republican Party this is a very inclusive party this is a great party Republicans are proudly fighting for nationwide school choice including right here in South Carolina we want to give school choice to every child in America who needs it from kindergarten to twelfth grade because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school and I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life that's a big deal this could not have been done by anyone but the Republican Party you know they came to me a group of people and they wanted criminal justice reform and I wasn't sure about the issue but we had a lot of great Republicans very much in favor of it including people that happen to be right here today and they were very much and I started studying the issue worked hard on the issue and criminal justice reform you saw Alice Johnson come out of prison 22 years she had another 20 years left think of it for a phone call or a phone call a great woman but we have many people coming out that shouldn't be there for anywhere near those terms not for those terms but they came to see me a group a group of people came Van Jones he came up oh thank you sir if they needed four senators they needed help I called Lindsey I called everybody I called Tim who was so great on everything I called everybody they needed four senators and maybe five and they needed help with some of the ones that weren't moving in the right direction and I gave it to him and I got it and it was not easy and we got criminal justice reform and then I signed it and then this Van Jones has a program that gets no ratings absolutely at all and they say Van Jones wants to thank everybody for criminal justice reform so I called our great first lady over and said darling please take a look it's gonna be so nice because honestly look they couldn't have done even close without being I got all these people together got him done god it was impossible previous presidents couldn't even think about it they couldn't even think about doing it and they tried although I don't think they tried too hard they could have never done it so he gets up and he starts by saying I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton I knew what he was very heavy he looked better when he was heavy hits Joe he's one of the few people he really looked better what he was in he looked much better when he was heavy I gotta tell him I have to explain cuz I know him very well he would admit that he has a lot of respect for your president but he can't admit it on television but he called that he said I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton and then name after name after name of people that I never heard of my wife said are they gonna think about you right are they gonna think about you I said darling of course I said he's saving me till the end because I was by far it's true this is true Tim Lindsay this is true I said he's saving me till the end it's gonna be such an honor to be recognized because I don't get enough publicity I need a little bit more he got to the end and he didn't say it and she looked at me she sort of smiled I think she loved it in a certain way you know but she sort of smiled she said it's too bad I said yes then he said I've one more thing to say we must get out this year and fight and vote against this President of the United States can you believe it's a two-story Van Jones I mean these are just terrible that they could so I was a little embarrassed in front of our great first lady but I'll I'll live through it somehow I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem  we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights 52 years 52 years the Golan Heights have been fighting and fighting for I did it and I did the true capital Jerusalem right how many presidents promised that every president for many many decades promised we're going to do that they never did it I did it we did a lot we've invested more than two trillion dollars in the United States military including more than 150 million dollars this year in Joint Base Charleston Fort Jackson and Parris Island  and we created these six branch of the American armed forces the space force we have another branch 72 years not for 72 years the Air Force have they done a new branch we did the space force you know when I first said if they thought everybody thought I was joking I said I'm not joking they thought it was like from the comic strips or the future movies I said no it's all about space in a number of years people are gonna say I can't believe we didn't do this sooner you know we need a little vision we need a little foresight and you know what I mentioned space force and arenas like this it gets one of the biggest hands because that's where it's at that's where it's going unfortunately or fortunately we needed for defense we needed for offer six friends 72 years four years we watched as your politicians apologize for America now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of South Carolina at stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation I really believe that it's the survival you see these maniacs that we're dealing with they want to give away everything we will end up being Venezuela large-scale version if you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure then we must devote everything we have towards victory in November of 2020 November 3rd to be exactly only this way can we save the America we love and drain the swamp I never thought it was this deep man I talked about a swamp you never told me it was this bad fellas that swamp is bad he got dirty cops at the top of the FBI you got a lot of dirty people but you also have phenomenal people in the FBI and other places but we're draining that swamp I never know is going to be this dirty and we're getting a lot of help from a lot of great people and with your help we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare-to-work dependence to independence and from poverty to prosperity this is what's happening think of it from poverty to prosperity look at some of the stories that you have over there look at some of the incredible stories look at Kim Scott look at that incredible story oh really it's a good Lindsay will say it and I give about 99% of the credit to Tim Scott's mother I do I guarantee you Tim there was no games right there was no games in your household it was let's go to work right great mother thank you very much thank you together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe sane and lawful system finally of immigration we will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA we will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine finding new cures for childhood cancer infectious diseases like we're working on right now and ending the AIDS epidemic nobody thought this was possible in less now than nine years that it should have been started before we will end the AIDS epidemic who would have thought we could have done that we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant our flag on Mars you have to land on and then you go tomorrow we will defend privacy free speech religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms  and above all we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we support protect and defend the Constitution of the United States we stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life we believe that faith and family not government and bureaucracy are the true American Way we believe that children should be

and hello again from fox news in washington today from the white house we're on the president's patio just outside the oval office president trump you've agreed to answer all manner of questions no subject off-limits thank you and welcome back to fox news sunday thank you very much let's start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months you still talk about it as quote burning embers but i want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months as you can see we hit a peak here in april 36 000 cases it's cases a day cases then it went down and now since june it has gone up more than doubled one day this week 75 000 new cases more than double chris that's because we have great testing because we have the best testing in the world if we didn't test you wouldn't be able to show that chart if we tested half as much those numbers would be down but but this is burning embers sir this is a foreign but i don't say i say flames we'll put out the flames and we'll put out in some cases just burning embers we also have burning embers we have embers and we do have flames florida became more flame-like but it's uh it's going to be under control and you know it's not just this country it's many countries we don't talk about it in the news they don't talk about mexico and brazil and still parts of europe which actually got hit sooner than us so it's a little ahead of us in that sense but you take a look why don't they talk about mexico which is not helping us and all i can say is thank god i build most of the wall because if i didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with mexico but sir we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world our mortality rate is higher than brazil it's higher than russia and the european union has us on a travel ban yeah i think what we'll do well we have them in a travel ban too chris i closed them off if you remember i was the one that did the european union very early but when you talk about mortality rates i think it's the opposite i think we have one of the lowest mortality rates we had 900 deaths in a single day we will take this week ready do you please get me the mortality right yeah kaylee's right here i heard we have one of the lowest maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world you have the numbers please because i heard we had the best mortality right number number one low mortality right i hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about you said we had the worst mortality rate in the world and we have the best all right it's a little complicated but bear with us we went with numbers from johns hopkins university which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus the u.s ranked seventh better than the united kingdom but worse than brazil and russia the white house went with this chart from the european cdc which shows italy and spain doing worse but countries like brazil and south korea doing better other countries doing better like russia aren't included in the white house charge california locking down again florida deadliest day of the entire pandemic uh hospitals at capacity a number of places around the country shortages of testing shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors a lot of people say this is because we don't have a national plan you talk about states we don't have a national plan do you take responsibility for that look i take responsibility always for everything because it's ultimately my job too i have to get everybody in line some governors have done well some governors have done poorly they're supposed to have supplies they didn't have i supplied everybody now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas we're doing great but we have a surge in certain areas but you don't hear people complaining about ventilators we've got all the ventilators we can use we're supplying them to other countries we go out into parking lots and everything everybody gets a test we find if we did half the testing with all of that being said i'm glad we did it this is the right way to do it i'm glad we did what we're doing but we have more tests by far than any country in the world but sir testing is up 37 well that's very good i understand cases are up 194 it isn't just the testing has gone up it's that the virus has spread the positivity rate has increased there are many of those cases many of those cases are young people that would heal in a day they have the sniffles and we put it down as a test many of them don't forget i guess it's like 99.7 percent people are going to get better and in many cases they're going to get better very quickly we go out and we look and then on the news look if you go back to the news all of your even your wonderful competitors you'll see cases are up well cases are up many of those cases shouldn't even be cases cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most tested no country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing we are the envy of the world they call and they say the most incredible job anybody's done is our job on testing because we're going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests you look at other countries they don't even do tests they do test if somebody walks into the hospital they're sick they're really sick they test them then or they'll test them in a doctor's office but they don't go around have massive areas of testing and we do and i'm glad we do but it really skews the numbers i'm going to do you a favor because i'm sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say trump he tries to play it down he tries to make it not seem as serious as it is 75 000 cases a day show me the death chart well i don't have the doubt the death chart is a thousand cases a day excuse me it's all too much it shouldn't be one case it came from china they should have never let it escape they should have never let it out but it is what it is take a look at europe take a look at the numbers in europe and by the way they're having surgeries are 6 000 in the whole european union they don't test they don't test like it's impossible that they don't have the viruses badly it's possible that they don't test that's what's possible we find cases and many of those cases heal automatically we're finding in a way we're creating trouble certainly we're creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say oh we have more cases look we did something that nobody's ever done not only the ventilators where we're supplying them all over the world we did a testing program the likes of which nobody's ever done before the head of the cdc dr redfield said this on tuesday i do think the fall and the winter of 2020 and 2021 are going to be probably one of the most difficult times that we've experienced in american public health do you agree with dr redfield i don't know and i don't think he knows i don't think anybody knows with this this is a very tricky deal everybody thought the summer it would go away and we'd come back in the fall well in the summer it came they used to say the heat the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out remember and then it might come back in the fall so they got that one wrong they they got a lot wrong they got a lot wrong the world health got a tremendous amount wrong they basically did whatever china wanted them to and will save now almost 500 million dollars a year which is nice but the world health got a lot wrong but this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you i agree people say that you talk about the world as you'd like to see it rather than follow the science no well let me let me just ask the question sir why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit dr fauci who is the nation's top infectious disease expert because we're not if one man from my administration doesn't like him because he made a few mistakes look dr fauci said don't wear a mask dr fauci told me not to ban china it would be a big mistake i did it over and above his recommendation dr fauci then said you saved tens of thousands of lives more than that he said you saved tens of thousands of lives dr fauci has made some mistakes but i have a very good i spoke to him yesterday at length i have a very good relationship with dr fatcher but sir this week this weekend your white house put out a series of statements so-called mistakes that dr fauci has had made one of your closest aides one of your right-hand men daniel's daniel scavina put out this have you seen this dr dr fawcett who shows him as a leaker and an alarmist oh i don't know that he's a little why he's a little bit of an armist that's okay a little bit i'm going to learn a little bit of an alarm system let me just say dr fauci at the beginning and again i have a great relationship with him i spoke to him at length yesterday dr fauci at the beginning said this will pass don't worry about it this will pass he was wrong dr fauci said don't ban china don't ban china i did he then admitted that i was right you made mistakes too i guess everybody makes i was gonna say you said at one point it's one person coming in from china and we have it under control it's going to be just fine when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that's a pretty good job we've done i think we're going to be very good with the coronavirus i think that at some point uh that's going to sort of just disappear i hope i'll be right eventually i will be right eventually you know i said it's going to disappear i'll say it again but it's going to disappear and i'll be right i don't think so right i don't think so you know why it doesn't describe it because i've been right probably more than anybody else then there are masks from the first day that the cdc said that people should wear mass on april 3rd you said you weren't going to you wore a mask for the first time in public at walter reed this weekend question the cdc says if everybody wore a mask for four to six weeks we could get this under control do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start and would you consider will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks no i want people to have a certain freedom and i don't believe in that no and i don't agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask everything disappears hey dr fauci said don't wear a mask our surgeon general terrific guy said don't wear a mask everybody was saying don't wear a mask all of a sudden everybody's got to wear a mask and as you know masks cause problems too with that being said i'm a believer in masks i think masks are good but i leave it up to the governors many of the governors are changing they're more masked into they like the concept of masks but some of them don't agree i do say this schools have to open young people have to go to school and there's problems when you don't go to school too and there's going to be a funding problem because we're not going to fund when they don't open their schools we're not going to fund them we're not going to give them money if they're not going to school if they don't open two points on that first of all what the federal government gives is only is eight percent ten percent and you know what uh that's a lot of money and you're going to take them you know where the money goes it goes overwhelmingly to disadvantaged kids and children with disabilities let this i wouldn't just put send more money so that schools be safer let the schools open did you ever see the statistics on young people below the age of 18 the state of new jersey had thousands of deaths of all of these thousands one person below the age of 18 in the entire state one person and that was a person that had i believe he said diabetes one person below the age of 18 died in the state of new jersey during all of this you know they had a hard time and they're doing very well now so that's it the stimulus bill is running out the end of this month the republicans say they want liability limits which the democrats don't like you say that you want a payroll tax cut which even some republicans are cool to well a lot of republicans like it will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions well we're going to see but we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in you don't know where this virus comes from they'll sit down at a restaurant they'll sue the restaurant the guy's out of business so we do need some kind of a you know immunity you do need it just like you need immunity for the police okay whether they like it or not you need immunity for the police but they do need a form of immunity you don't know if they caught it and nobody's ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other you can't put these you know the people out look the democrats don't want to do that because they're total they're totally captured by the lobby of lawyers the lawyers lobby is probably the most powerful in the country what about the payroll tax cut uh i want to see it i want to see if it's win the bill uh i'll have to see but yeah i would consider not signing it if we don't have a payroll tax cut yes hot enough that you're here mr president it's hot it's about uh well sort of almost record-breaking you know we wanted to do it inside this was your choice but i wanted you to sweat a little bit well we both are there has been a spike in violent crime in america in recent weeks we've seen deaths up in new york deaths up in chicago shootings how do you explain it and what are you going to do about it i explain it very simply by saying that they're democrat-run cities they're liberally run they're stupidly run we have forced them in seattle to end the chop because you know we were going in that following day you probably have heard it we were getting ready to go in we were all set and when they heard that we were going they set their police force liberal democrats have been running cities in this country for decades poorly why is it so bad right now uh they've run them poorly it was always bad but now it's gotten totally out of control and it's really because they want to defund the police and biden wants to fun sir he does not look he signed a charter with bernie sanders i will get that one just like i was right on the mortality rate did you read the charter that he agreed there's nothing about the funding oh really it says abolish it says let's go all right let me give me the charter please all right chris you've got to start studying for this he says defund the police he says defund the police they talk about abolishing the police they talk about illegal aliens i look forward to seeing that meanwhile the george floyd murder has reignited the issue of racism in policing in this country i want to give you a couple of statistics nationwide blacks are twice as likely fewer in absolute numbers but in terms of per capita blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites are in minneapolis over the last five years police used force against blacks at a rate seven times that against whites can you understand why blacks would be angry at that of course i do of course they do many whites are killed also you have to say that i mean many many whites are killed i hate the sound but this is going on for decades this is going on for a long time long before i got here you know if you look at what's going on in portland those are anarchists and we've taken a very tough stand if we didn't take a stand in portland you know we've arrested many of these leaders if we didn't take that stand right now you would have a problem like you they were going to lose portland so let's see what this says here prosecution sanctuary cities incentivize illegal alien expand asylum abolish immigration detention no that's not what we'll find okay this thing is many pages long end prosecution of illegal border crosses support deathly and these are the worst things i'm not disagreeing with you on any of those i'm disagreeing about defund police the white house never sent us evidence the bernie biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police because there is none it calls for increased funding for police departments that meet certain standards biden has called for redirecting some police funding for related programs like mental health counseling this week you said that black lives matter and the confederate flag are both matters issues of freedom of speech but in the case of the confederate flag there are a lot of people who say these were traitors who split from this country fought this country in large part to preserve slavery is the confederate flag offensive it depends on who you're talking about when you're talking about when people proudly have their confederate flags they're not talking about racism they love their flag it represents the south they like the south people right now like the south i say it's freedom of of many things but it's freedom of speech so you're not offended by it well i'm not offended either by black lives matter that's freedom of speech and you know the whole thing with canceled culture we can't cancel our whole history we can't forget that the north and the south fought we have to remember that otherwise we'll end up fighting again you can't you can't just cancel all this but let me ask you this when it gets to be more than just cancel well maybe this is cancelled culture the national defense authorization act the ndaa you have threatened to veto it because in the bill and this is supported by republicans as well as democrats it would rename army bases named for confederate generals now this is a bill that funds military operations it gives soldiers a pay raise you're going to veto that because they'll get their pay raise hey look don't tell me this i got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our understood of our military i got soldiers brand new equipment brand new jets brand new rockets brand new 2.5 trillion i did more for the military than any president that's ever had this because i think that fort bragg fought robert and lee all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time decades and decades the military says they're for that excuse me i don't care what the military says i do i'm supposed to make the decision fort bragg is a big deal we won two world wars nobody even knows general bragg we won two world wars go to that community where fort bragg is in a great state i love that state go to go to the community say how do you like the idea of renaming fort bragg and then what are we going to name it you're going to name it after the reverend al sharpton what are you going to name it chris tell me what you're going to name it so there's a whole thing here we won two world wars two world wars beautiful world wars that were vicious and horrible and we want them out of fort bragg we want to out of all of these forts that now they want to throw those names away and no i'm against that and you know what most other people are and i even i don't believe in polls because i see the fakest polls i've ever seen but that poll is a 64 thing which actually surprised me we won world wars out of these out of these military bases no i'm not going to go changing them i'm not going to say you'll be each of them i might yeah i might at mount rushmore on july 3rd you said that we face a far left fascism in this country and then you said this our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains you said our children are taught in school to hate our country where do you see that i just look at i look at school i watch i read look at the stuff now they want to change if 1492 columbus discovered america you know we grew up you grew up we all did that's what we learned now they want to make it the 1619 project where did that come from what does it represent i don't even know so slavery that's what they're saying but they don't even know they just want to make a change cancel culture i hate the term actually but i use it better they cancel people hate i think so yeah i think so look at the professors look at what's going on in the colleges if a conservative goes on a college and look we have as many as them excuse me i think to the best of my knowledge we're sitting at the white house and the oval office is right behind me we have as many as them but who's them the liberal radical left and i'm not talking all i think liberal i i could tell you i like a lot of liberal people like like a lot of liberal governors and senators but but chris we have a radical left destructive ideology and it's being taught in our schools and don't act like you're surprised to hear this there are books written about it and we can't let that go on we can't let them change the true meaning of what we're all about and that's what they're trying to do and i don't want it to happen not on my watch it's not going to happen on my watch mr president you'll be happy to know that fox news has a new poll out today and you're going to be the very first person to hear about it in the national horse race joe biden leads you by eight points 49 to 41 that's i think three four points slimmer than it was a month ago and on the issues people trust biden more to handle the coronavirus by 17 points on race relations by 21 points and even on the economy they trust biden moore by one point i understand we still have more than a hundred days to this election but at this point you're losing first of all i'm not losing because those are fake polls they were fake in 2016 and now they're even more fake the polls were much worse in 2016. they interview 22 percent republican well how do you do 22 republican you see what's going on uh i have other polls that put me leading and we have polls where i'm leading i have a poll where we're leading in every swing state and i don't believe that you're first of all the fox polls whoever does your fox polls they're among the worst they got it all wrong in 2016. they've been wrong on every poll i've ever seen i must tell you no i'm just telling you and and let me let me ask you this so in the economy so i've always lead on the economy by a lot i know which is why i would like to put two sentences together they wheel them out he goes up he repeats he they ask him questions he reads a teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement you tell me the american people want to have that in an age where we're in trouble with other nations that are looking to do numbers on us so let me ask you a direct question no i'm going to ask you a direct question about joe biden is joe biden senile i don't want to say that i say he's not competent to be president to be president you have to be sharp and tough and so many other things he doesn't even come out of his basement they think oh this is a great campaign so he goes in i'll then make a speech it'll be a great speech and some young guys start writing vice president biden said this this this he didn't say it joe doesn't know he's alive okay he doesn't know he's alive do the american people want that number one number two i built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world not only in this country anywhere in the world until we got hit with the china virus we got hit with a virus shouldn't have happened and we had to close up we saved millions of lives now we've opened it up got to go back to school we're open we've got to do things we had the best job numbers we've ever had last month we should have good ones coming up in two weeks look i built the greatest economy in history i'm now doing it again you see the numbers the numbers are through the roof the democrats are purposely keeping their schools close keeping their states close i call to michigan i want to have a big rally in michigan do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in michigan do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in minnesota do you know we're not allowed to have a rally in nevada we're not allowed to have rallies well and these democrat run statements some people would say that that's a health risk some people would say it's fine i mean but i guarantee you there's some issues after time everything was gone 100 they still wouldn't allow it they're not allowing me to do it so they're not that they're not allowing me to have rallies but i got to tell you if i may sir respectfully in the fox poll they ask people who is more competent who's got whose mind is sounder biden beats you in that well i tell you what uh let's take a test let's take a test right now let's go down joe and i will take a test let him take the same test that i took incidentally i took the test too when i heard that you passed it yeah how did you do it well it's not the hardest task no but it has a picture and it says that and it's an element no no no you see that's all misrepresentation that's what it was on the web it's all misrepresentation because yes the first few questions are easy but i'll bet you couldn't even answer the last five questions i'll bet you couldn't they get very hard the last five well one of them was count back from 100 by seven and let me tell you you couldn't answer you couldn't answer all right what's the question many of the questions i'd get you the test i'd like to give it but i guarantee you that joe biden could not answer those questions okay and i answered all 35 questions correctly you you talk about how you're winning campaign's going well why did you replace brad parscale isn't that because he's a great digital guy uh we all like him a lot but i have somebody that i that was involved you know they're all they were all on the 2016 campaign and we have cory and we have all the people and actually steve bannon's been much better not being involved he says the greatest president ever i mean he's saying things that i said let's keep steve out there he's doing a good job but they're all being they're all involved if joe biden got in first of all he won't call the shots the people the radical left people that surround him will call religion will be gone okay life you could forget about that the whole question of life supreme when you say life you mean abortion absolutely a hundred percent that whole question which is a very you know it's always been a 50 50 thing it's actually trending a little bit more toward once religion is going to be gone what does that mean look at what they're doing to the churches they won't let the churches even open if they want to stand in a field six feet apart we've had churches that wanted to stand in fields six feet apart there has never been an administration that's done so much as i have from tax cuts to regulation cuts to rebuilding the military to getting choice for the vets nobody's done the things i've done nobody in three and a half years no other president has been able to do what i've done you're running in large part on the economy you've built it once now we have the coronavirus you're going to build it again and in fact you had great jobs numbers in may you had solid jobs numbers in june but i want you to look at some projections the nonpartisan congressional budget office says the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be ten and a half percent jp morgan says in the fourth quarter gdp will contract by 6.2 percent with states now rolling back some of the reopening and and well there are a lot of republicans there are a lot of republican states like texas but here's they'll be open very soon just ask my question there's no reason for california to do to be doing what they're doing all right except for november 3rd with the states shutting back the reopening in a lot of cases new lockdowns won't the economy still be a problem for you on elections i don't think so i think the economy is expanding and growing beautifully now the democrats want to keep it closed as long as possible because they think that's good for election but i think the economy is doing very well now we're coming back and we're coming back at a level that nobody would have thought possible and we and by the way take a look at another i mean a gauge whether you like it or not the stock market the stock market nasdaq hit its all-time high two weeks ago and it's beaten at 14 different times okay the stock market dow etc is a thousand points away from its all-time high meaning very close we're going to have a stock market perhaps on november 3rd that's the highest in history i want to talk to you about obamacare since the pandemic hit millions of people have lost their jobs and thereby lost their health insurance and almost a half a million have signed up for obamacare your administration just announced that you're signing on to a lawsuit to overturn obamacare and replace it why does it make sense to overturn obamacare which people now are relying on democrats are going to say the man who's wanted to kill obamacare is going to take away the protection for pre-existing conditions first of all we got rid of the individual mandate pre-existing conditions will always be taken care of by me and republicans 100 but you've been in the office three and a half years you don't have people we haven't had uh excuse me you heard me yesterday we're signing a health care plan within two weeks a full and complete health care plan that the supreme court decision on daca gave me the right to do so we're gonna solve we're gonna sign an immigration plan a health care plan and various other plans and nobody will have done what i'm doing in the next four weeks the supreme court gave the president of the united states powers that nobody thought the president had by approving by doing what they did their decision on daca and daca is going to be taken care of also but we're getting rid of it because we're going to replace it with something much better but we got rid of already which was most of obamacare the individual mandate and that i've already won on and we won also on the supreme court but the decision by the supreme court on daca allows me to do things on immigration on health care on other things that we've never done before and you're going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks your niece mary trump has written a book about you and your family and one of her main points is that she says your dad fred trump senior damaged the whole family and here's what she says about what you learned from your father he learned to become the killer you mentioned the man who needs to succeed at all costs who will do anything um to get attention financial rewards and to win do you see any truth in that my father liked to win my father was a very good man he was a strong man it's disgraceful that she said that she was not exactly a family favorite we didn't have a lot of respect or like for her i would have never said that except she writes a book that's so stupid and so vicious and it's a lie my father was a great wonderful man let me just ask you this question this is not a person that i spent very much time with very little time and now i'm glad you've developed a pretty thick skin over the years from decades of attacks in new york tabloids now from the press here and your political opponents here in washington but even for donald trump does it hurt you at all to be attacked in such personal terms by a member of your own family uh it hurts me more about attacking my father not being kind to my mother i have a mother who was like a saint she was incredible she was an incredible woman and she was nasty even to my mother she's a very scarred person she was not much of a family person but look let me just tell you my father was i think he was the most solid person i've ever met and he was a very good person he was a very very good person he was strong but he was good for her to say the kind of things a psychopath that he was a psychopath anybody that knew fred trump would call him a psychopath and you know what if he was i would tell you and i would say you know chris i was with my father and it was impossible my father was he was tough he was tough on me he was tough on all of the kids but tough in a in a solid sense in a really good sense for her to say i think the word she used was psychopath what a disgrace she ought to be ashamed of herself that book is a lie some people were surprised when you agreed to this interview to sit down with me what are you going to ask especially because of some of the mean tweets that you've said about me mike wallace wanna be nasty and obnoxious i will tell you after that one my son peter who you've met called and he said nasty no obnoxious maybe but here's the question one of your beef seems to be that i put democrats on the show and i ask them questions and and i guess the question i have is don't you understand it's my job to put democrats on as well as republicans and to ask them probing questions just like i asked republicans i'm not a big fan of fox i'll be honest with you they've changed a lot since roger ailes and i watch people like swalwell who i don't even know he goes on the show he got less than one percent all of a sudden he's on being interviewed for endless yeah but i i interviewed an answer wait i interviewed nancy i answered i uh interviewed using one tweet after i interviewed nancy pelosi and in the interview i asked her specifically about the fact in february you were in chinatown pitching tourism while the virus was spreading if the president underplayed the threat in the early days speaker pelosi didn't you as well isn't that legitimate to talk to the speaker of the house look i know you very well i respect you a lot i respect your father a lot i thought he's one of the most talented journalists there are and you likewise are a very talented person i do think this i think you are very uh uh i think you are toward the democrat side which is okay i mean it's not true if watch the james comey interview i did in december 17 significant errors in the fisa process and you say that it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way yeah he's right i was wrong but you make it sound like you're a a bystander an eyewitness you were the director of the fbi well a lot of this was going on sir sure i'm responsible for that's why i'm telling you i was wrong i was overconfident as director in our procedures you couldn't do as tough an interview with comey i i'd like to think i treat everybody the same it just seems to me that you are very prone to be nice to the democrats and maybe i'm wrong about that chris but it's an honor to be with you it's fine i love it i love it that it's close to 100 degrees your choice again yeah i know that so i'm not saying you're going to lose i am not saying that we saw how you turned it around last time i don't think i'm going to lose at all but if you did how crushing would it be first of all let me just tell you something i know everyone wants to know that because they'd love to see me lose fine i'm not i have not seen that i've been written off do you know how many times i've been i'm not doing it this time don't don't do it because but how crushing would it be and you know why i won't lose because the country in the end they're not going to have a man who who's shot he's shot he's mentally shot let him come out of his basement go around i'll make four or five speeches a day i'll be interviewed by you i'll be interviewed by the worst killers that hate my my guts they hate my guts there's nothing they can ask me that i won't give them a proper answer to some people will like it some people won't like i agree with that but look you answered let biden sit through an interview like this he'll be on the ground crying for mommy he'll say mommy mommy please take me home well we've asked him for an interview sir he can't do an interview he's incompetent there's a number you don't mention it's called the enthusiasm number the enthusiasm for trump is through the roof i haven't mentioned it even higher than last time the enthusiasm for biden is non-existent everyone knows each other but the enthusiasm against you okay that's his only shot right that's his only shot i agree and those people know i'm doing a good job but there's something in my personality that they don't like because look nobody's done what i've done biden wants to come in and ruin our country triple your taxes he wants to do things he wants to add regulations that i've all cut and we still have regulation a lot of regulation but i've cut it down to a level that nobody's nobody ever thought possible he will destroy this country but it won't be him it will be the radical left the same type ideology that took over venezuela one of the richest countries in the world they now have no water they have no food and they have no medicine that's going to happen two final questions a few wins in general not talking about november are you a good loser i'm not a good loser i don't like to lose it i don't lose too often i don't like something but are you gracious you don't know until you see it depends i think mail-in voting is is going to rig the election i really do uh are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election i have to say look hillary clinton asked me the same thing no i asked you the same thing in the debate there is a tradition in this country in fact one of the prize of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country are you saying you're not prepared now what i'm saying is that i will tell you at the time i'll keep you in suspense well chris and you know what she's the one that never accepted her great she never accepted her loss and she looks like can you give can you give a direct answer you will accept the election look you i have to see no i'm not going to just say yes i'm not going to say you know and i didn't last time either whether it's in 2021 or 2025 how will you regard your years as president of the united states i think i was very unfairly treated uh from before i even won i was under investigation by a bunch of thieves crooks it was an illegal investigation but what about the russia what about the good parts there no i want to know this i have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years and i've done it suffering through investigations where people have been general flynn where people have been so unfairly treated the russia hoax it was all a hoax the mueller scam it was all a scam it was all false i made a bad decision on one bad decision jeff sessions and now i feel good because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of alabama here's the bottom line i've been very unfairly treated and i don't say that as paranoid i've been very everybody says it it's going to be interesting to see what happens but there's tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated i was president obama and biden spied on my campaign it's never happened in history if it were the other way around the people would be in jail for 50 years right now that would be comey that would be brennan that would be all of this the two lovers strzok and paige they would be in jail now for many many years they would be in jail it would have started two years ago and they'd be there for 50 years the fact is they illegally spied on my campaign let's see what happens despite that i did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years mr president thank you thanks for talking with us thank you thank you very much
so hello everybody thank you very much let me begin by sending america's deepest sympathies to the people of lebanon where reports indicate that many many people were killed hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in beirut our prayers go out to all the victims and their families the united states stands ready to assist lebanon a very good relationship with the people of lebanon and we will be there to help it looks like a terrible attack i also want to provide the latest on tropical storm isis approximately 600 000 are without power along the east coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible i spoke to governor cooper i spoke to governor desantis and i spoke to all of the people at fema and they're working very hard coastal areas and the storms path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents while inland areas could see flooding and very very high winds fema is responding to states that have requested the assistance we have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely we have uh the military on guard but we have uh fema is there in all cases corps of engineer is ready if needed the army corps of engineers very talented people i urge everyone in the storm's path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities i now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the china virus before i do that i want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out the manufacturing index of the institute for supply management that's ism most of you know it by ism increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in july to 54.2 that was fantastic the highest reading since march of 2019 this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout july and showed significant improvement despite the southwest in particular virus hot spots the ism measures and it's a very strong measure of new orders rose five points in july to 61.5 and its highest uh reading that would be since september of 2018 that's big number since the april low new orders are up over 34 points which is the largest increase in the history of the ism dating back all the way to 1948 so 34 points that's the largest since 1948. similarly the ism's measure of production is up 35 points from its april low to a reading of 62.1 which is the largest three-month gain in over 70 years at some some number these were somewhat surprising but i've been saying we're doing well and those numbers are really spectacular automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the march low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly it's 65 percent increase since then to 14.5 million units which is a a massive number the great strength and great news is really for states like in particular michigan and ohio south carolina pennsylvania very good florida a little bit these are great numbers record-setting numbers the strength in new car sales is also evident in the used-car market where soaring demand literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used-car prices this is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry the need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector and we think very substantially based on the numbers we're very very happy with these numbers and i think most people are anywhere from surprise to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way economy-wide inventories crashed at a near 320 billion dollar annualized rate last quarter crash in that case means a good thing not a bad thing that's the largest drop ever on record ever homebuilder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sale sentiment is now higher than last year in new homes recently made a 13-year high so we have a 13 year high in new home new home construction new business applications are very strong that just came out the widely followed atlanta fed gdp and that's something that they have just come out with now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates it looks like it's showing 20 annualized growth in the current quarter so 20 in the current quarter will take that all day long let's see if that's right that's a projection so we'll see if that's right the atlanta fed very respected the virus back to that we are continuing to monitor and monitor particular hot spots across the south southwest and the west and we're seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually especially to protect those who are most at risk which has really been our primary focus for ever since we've gotten to understand this horrible horrible plague that's been unleashed in our country by china as of yesterday cases are declining in 70 of the jurisdictions compared to 36 percent last monday that's a big big number 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10 have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-july in other states the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always as strong even though the numbers are getting very good states that have a test positivity rate between five and ten percent and in the states with the lowest positivity rates we also see slight increases in daily cases and a couple of them we must ensure that these states did not become new flare-ups so we're watching them very very closely fortunately thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths fatalities nationwide are that roughly half the level of the april peak so the death the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level one is too much one death because this should have never happened to us it should have been stopped it very easily by china in wuhan thanks to our major advances in treatment we've seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups compared to april mortality progressive strategy focused on protecting americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a vaccine we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly and we're doing that we're doing that at a level that we've never even dreamt possible both with testing and with common sense and those with underlining conditions especially the elderly with the underlining whether it's heart or diabetes they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems while allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school where embers flare up we must engage immediately and that's what we're doing this is the science-based approach and that's good with us working very hard on that an extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole so there won't be lockdowns but we watch specific areas we're very careful and we're putting out embers we're putting out flames when you look at what's happening with miami and it's going the numbers are going down but florida is going down very significantly texas and california are going down rather significantly on telemedicine as we discussed the last time as and as i said numerous times during this day it's an incredible thing that's happening a central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that's what's happening the number of medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14 000 a week to nearly 1.7 million so from 14 000 to 1.7 million per week in total 10 million medicare beneficiaries of excess telehealth services since the pandemic began that's a tremendous thing that's happened with telehealth as we shelter those at high risk we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks and you've read and seen what's happened today today's news was very exciting through operation warp speed we're also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates and we're determined to have a vaccine very quickly we think we're going to have something very soon we have great companies these are the among the greatest companies in the world but right now they don't like me so much because i'm forcing them to drop drug prices prescription drug prices very massively some of these companies are involved in that some of them aren't we're having a tremendous you'll see a tremendous drop in price we're using favorite nations we're using the rebates we're using everything so long i've heard about how well middlemen are they call them the middlemen and uh they are very wealthy nobody even knows who they are but they're very wealthy people and we're doing the rebates we're doing purchases from other countries like canada which buys drugs for much less money than the united states is allowed to under a very bad system i don't call it archaic i call it bad because it's meant really for drug companies to get higher prices but under under the system of matching that we have if germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is two dollars we're allowed to say we want favorite nations and we want the pill for the same the same as the lowest country in the world if they sell to one country lower than anybody else that's the price we're going to get drug companies aren't too happy about that big pharma we've also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies steroid treatments antivirals and other therapies to treat the illness today the nih we're very exciting announced that they're beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments which will take place in 40 cities across the country we're going to move move very quickly results look very good already incredible results more than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway and we've secured five hundred thousand courses of treatment for rem deservier of remdessevier we're really doing a job with it and it's helping a lot of people that's why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good relatively speaking that is but that's for american hospitals through the month of september so we have room desevere at a very high level for hospitals through the month of september that's big news the united states also is far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world testing has been incredible what we've been able to do nobody's even close since march 12th we've increased daily testing by 32 000 how's that 32 000 somebody would say that must be a typo it's not a typo 32 000 we now conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820 000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week and now that we're understanding the virus we're understanding very much what we're doing with respect to who it affects who it's destroying and who gets away with it like young people very young people we'll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing i call it focus testing by comparison mexico so we're doing numbers that are incredible but by comparison mexico as you know the president was here is a great guy but their their numbers are much different they do about 1 million tests france has done 2.9 million tests canada is around the 4 million mark australia is around the 4 million mark the united states is testing more people in a single week than in many cases uh large segments or large well-known countries all put together it's been an amazing achievement the testing and the quality of the testing also and now we're doing testing where you can have results in five minutes seven minutes and 15 minutes as opposed to waiting to come back from labs for it to come back from labs over the last several weeks hhs has opened surging testing sites in baton rouge new orleans phoenix miami jacksonville florida mcallen texas bakersfield california and this week we're opening new surge sites in houston texas atlanta to date more than 130 000 tests have been conducted at these sites last week the fda also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual's blood which is a big deal allowing us to learn more about the immune response fema and hhs has worked with the private sector to deliver more than we have new numbers more than 200 million n95 masks 855 million surgical masks 36 million goggles and face shields 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves billion can you believe that billion gloves and we distribute that to the governors different states and uh they're when we get on the phone with them they're very happy that i can tell you no no complaints from any of them they're very very happy what they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons but they are very happy with the job we've done in our national stockpile we've tripled the number of n95 masks on hand to more than 40 million triple the number of gowns to 15 million and quadruple the number of ventilators to nearly 70 000. these numbers are growing every day and we're now making thousands of ventilators many thousands of ventilators a month and we're getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators they're very hard to produce and very complicated machines so we're we're fully stocked here and we've made sure that every state is fully stocked but we're getting them to a lot of countries that need help we'll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity protective equipment supplies and medicine i'm more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus and i want to thank you all for being here we'll take a few questions uh yeah please i wanted to ask you about kodak you had a big announcement the other day about getting kodak into the pharmaceutical business but the sec is now investigating what happened can you say a word or two whether you think that there might have been some kind of a problem uh in terms of how those arrangements were made is there any grounds for concern from your perspective no i don't know i wasn't involved in the deal the concept of the deal is good but i'll let you know we'll we'll do a little study on that we'll find out if there's if there is any problem we'll let you know about it very quickly but i wasn't involved in it it's a big deal it's a way of bringing back a great area to an addition to pharmaceuticals kodak has been a great name but obviously pretty much in a different business and so we'll see what that's all about but we'll we'll let you know very quickly yeah please um i just want to follow up before i ask a coronavirus question on lebanon you called this an attack uh are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident well it would seem like it based on the explosion i met with some of our great generals and they just seemed to feel that it was this was not a some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event this was a seems to be according to them they would know better than i would but they seem to think it was a attack it was a bomb of some kind yes interesting um and on coronavirus you've talked a lot about when you talk about the mortality rate the deaths as a proportion of cases which i understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does that keeping people alive who get infected but when you're talking about the scope of this virus when you look at the percentage of the population that's died there's only three countries that have more deaths than the us so how do you explain that that why the percentage of the population has died is so much higher in the us well i think actually the numbers are lower than others i'll get back to you on that but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries we're at the bottom of the list and we're uh relative to cases also we're at the bottom of the list which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list but i can get back to you we have about four or five different lists on that and we're generally speaking at the very bottom of the list so i'll get back to you when i look at the johns hopkins uh you know chronovirus resource center on their website it says the most affected countries when you look at deaths for a hundred thousand people the populations of how many people the population have died you have the uk peru chile and then the us um you know canada has eight thousand nine thousand deaths obviously they're smaller than us but that's only six percent of the population uh you know that there's six percent of our total cases so why aren't the deaths so much higher than the last of our numbers were based on the new york had a very tough time as you know new york new jersey that area and when you take them out uh just as an example take a look at florida relative to new york that's not to say anything wrong with new york it's just a very tough place people are close together it's crowded it's it's not easy but when you take that out our numbers are among the lowest and even with it in i will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers they've done a fantastic job on it yeah yes mr president i would like to ask a question about the election but one thing on unemployment first are you considering taking executive action to extend or rather reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week if congress can't get a deal by the end of the week and as a general point what rate then would you want in there a percentage or flat rate we are looking at it we're also looking at various other things that i'm allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension and so we're allowed to do things we're talking with the democrats they seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the democrat-run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management i mean really bad management so that seems to be where they they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by democrats in some cases radical left democrats that have not done a good job i appreciate today the wall street journal said very good things that we did a great job in portland by having our people go in homeland security chad wolfe and folks we went into portland and we've done a great job and they had that in an editorial that we that we really won that situation but we want the whole we we did save the courthouse the courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down it was in tremendous danger we went in we took care of it uh and we appreciated what the wall street journal said as far as the various uh things that i may or may not sign uh i i may not have to sign i mean progress is being made as you know very well in the hill we'll see what happens but i have the right including the payroll tax suspension uh we may do some things we want to take care of the eviction problem people are being evicted very unfairly it's not their fault it's china's fault it's not their fault and people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order so if we don't get and we want to do it relatively quickly i mean even from the standpoint of covid uh people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters and this is not a time you never want to be in a shelter but this is not a time to be in a shelter with a covet they catch it they get it and it's no good so i may have to do something on evictions too because the democrats amazingly don't want to do it we offer them short-term deals and we offer them lots of alternatives but so far the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by democrats okay and if i put on the election sir can i present trump on the uh the sale of tick-tock you're basically arguing that the us government is going to collect a cut from a type of a transaction including two companies in which it doesn't hold a stake in that's unprecedented that's never happened in u.s history before and the administration has offered very little explanation about how that's going to work can you back your statement out and provide specifics about how you say that's impressive did you actually use that term i said it's unprecedented well it's almost the same thing not quite i like it i like impressive i like it impressive not quite close uh so tic tac tic toc is very successful it does tremendous business in the united states people are riveted by it i mean i have many friends when they saw that announcement they're calling i think their kids love it they don't because they don't get to see their kids anymore but they are it's it's an amazing thing whatever it may be and i told microsoft and frankly others if they want to do it if they make a deal for tick-tock whether it's the 30 percent in the united states or the whole company i say it's okay but if you do that we're really making it possible because we're letting you operate here so the united states treasury would have to benefit also not just the not just the sellers and i said inform very simple i mean we have we have all the cards because without us you can't come into the united states it's like if you're a landlord you have a tenant the tenant's business needs a rent it needs a lease and so what i said to them is whatever the price is a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the united states and they understood that and actually they agreed with me i mean i think they agreed with me very much yeah please anybody thank you thank you so that deal may or may not happen we've given them until september 15th or so and we'll see if we can have it and if there can be great security meaning the obvious security microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels including working with the department of defense and you know they're very high level approvals so it would be good but there are other companies also yes well thank you sir have you or the anyone in the administration reached out to other companies aside from microsoft to see if they're interested we've had other companies call us microsoft called me directly and we've had other companies call i don't know where they are it sounds like microsoft is along the way of doing something uh i don't blame them it'd be you know it's a great company it's really a great company but we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies including huawei which as you know we put a halt to but we can't take the security risk i think our attitude on china has changed greatly since the china virus hit us i think it changed greatly it hit the world and it shouldn't have they should have been able to stop it so uh we feel differently i just don't know when you lose when you lose so many thousands of people and you know ultimately it'll be millions of people around the world uh it's a terrible thing that happened to the united states and europe and the entire world really a terrible thing yes please president i have two quick questions going on to fire someone on policing on the virus you said recently that there can be too much testing can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many americans to the virus and why you haven't provided a date by which all americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the white house well we do more testing than anybody in the world as i explained and i don't mean just a little bit if you look at india they're at about 11 million and we're at 61 million and there comes a point when you just you you want to focus your testing in a different way and we'll be announcing some what we've done is incredible with the testing not only the testing not only the number of tests but also very importantly the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the testing nobody thought it would be possible to get a 5 minute and a 15 minute result that's a very accurate result and we do with abbott abbott laboratories has done a great job many of these companies have done an incredible job so we're looking at that very strongly and we're looking at uh doing something that if we do if we do it look right now what the testing is doing is helpful but we're spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it we want to have a channel very accurately we want to be able to help the most people we can but we are testing at a level that no country in the world and i've spoken to the leaders of the world and they'll ask me about it no country in the world thought it would be it's even believable that we're able to test so much 61 million versus you know most countries don't even test you know when they test when somebody's feeling badly if somebody's feeling badly they're symptomatic that's when they test and that's a big difference with us we go around and looking because if we find we find spots we find hot spots one problem is uh from the standpoint of uh the media we end up with far more cases than we would normally show so it's you know as i called it the other day and a statement i said it's called media gold you know for the media it's gold but the truth is it's uh we've done an incredible job in testing nobody in the world has done the job other leaders have told me the same thing they can't believe we're able to do it and and we will continue but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger most in need thank you mr president i wanted to ask you um first about what you tweeted out earlier today in regards to florida and your comfortableness as it relates to male and ballots for florida why does that apply to florida and it doesn't apply to male invaliding across the country so florida's got a great republican governor and it had a great republican governor it's got ron desantis rick scott two great governors and over a long period of time they've been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally florida is different from other states i mean in nevada where you have a governor he said let's just send out millions of ballots and the post office cannot be prepared i haven't spoken to the post office about it but i don't know how they could possibly be prepared florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee so in the case of florida there aren't too many people that would qualify they're so well run florida's a very well-run state low taxes low everything they've done a great job really a great job and the two governors between the both of them they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the even in the case of mail-in ballots the postal services are built up there you know it takes a long time when you look at the carolyn maloney election i think they and i'll give you the story i think you have to do that election over that election is no good you have to take a look in new york they have thousands of ballots they don't know what happened to them is there fraud is there it's a disaster that's only for a relatively small number of ballots but i think they have to do the election in new york over the times wrote a big story about it yesterday front page story it's a disaster it's a mess and they have to do that i think they have to do that election over nobody can know what the election result is so in the case of florida they've done a great job they've had tremendous success with it but they've been doing this over many years and they've made it really terrific so for florida you can mail in your ballots you don't have to go in maybe a couple of other states they've worked out a system but this took years to do this doesn't take weeks or months in the case of nevada they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks and you can't do that i can't imagine the post office could do it all of a sudden they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots but florida's done a great job and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in florida it's going to matter thank you all very much thank you thank you what about in other states did you encourage voters in other states to request
are looking at this 2020 showdown presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden has chosen california senator kamala harris as his running mate headed into november the two appearing for the first time yesterday and immediately aimed at the president over his handling of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic joining me right now is the president of the united states donald j trump right now mr president thank you so much for calling in this morning good thank you very much good morning it's great to it's great to have you here to get a reaction to what we're seeing on the other side what is your reaction to kamala harris as joe biden's running mate well she's radical left now she tries to pretend she's not but she's the most liberal person in the u.s senate acknowledged to be she's done things that are terrible in terms of the police in terms of the second amendment in terms of everything else and she uh is a big taxer as joe is a big taxer they want to tax four trillion dollars it's going to be the biggest tax increase in history by far it will triple up records and they're big taxers it's uh just something that won't work we'll have you will see a depression likes of which you have never seen you have to go back to 1929 i guess it doesn't get too much worse than that and you'll just see that and frankly you know we've had a tremendous uh a tremendous market you and i have talked about that the stock market think of it we're almost back to where we were and we're still in the pandemic which will be going away as i say it'll be going away they scream how can you say that i said because it's going to be going away but you know we're in the middle of a pandemic and yet we're going to be hitting records i guess nasdaq already has many times like 14 times and the dow is you take a look at the numbers i see for the first time today it's actually it's actually down a few points i'm shocked almost shocked to see that but we've been going up i think we're up 9 000 points 54 since march so somebody made a lot of money and i hope those 401k people didn't do anything when it got down when it dipped because they'll be very unhappy right now but if they stayed with trump they're they're very rich so i mean this market is trading higher i guess on the anticipation that the economy is going to come back in second half or in 2021 as well as of course these rock bottom interest rates do you have confidence that we are going to see a double-digit growth number in the second half what does 2021 look like in your view from an economic standpoint mr president so i think it depends on who wins i think if he wins you're going to end up with a a disaster to be honest i see his plans the new green deal is something that the likes of which nobody can even comprehend it's it's like drawn by children it's joined by children it's so ridiculous okay you go over point over point and they're actually serious about it i used to think they were playing games it was politics i don't even think it's good politics it's so ridiculous but they're talking about no fossil fuels which means basically no energy you'd have to close down half of the businesses of the country you have to rebuild cities because uh too much light gets through the windows so let's make the windows nice and small let's rip down the empire state building and replace it with a with no windows i mean the whole thing is so preposterous it's so crazy and i guess you're talking about a hundred trillion dollars right to do it assuming you did it you know which will never happen by the way but but i will tell you as well no airplanes let's not get more than one car i'm sure the car business would love that let everyone get a car and live by it the cows you know i don't know if they actually put the cows in you know they were getting hit very hard by the animal rights groups but they don't want to have cows they don't want to have any form of animals these people are crazy okay and this is uh this is what we're getting and it's amazing the way uh sleepy joe buys into it he buys into it like oh great you know he doesn't know what he's doing and now you have a sort of a mad woman i i call her because she was so angry and so such hatred with justice kavanaugh i mean i've never seen anything like it she was the angriest of the group and they were all angry they're all radical left angry people and they're angry because i beat them they still haven't forgotten you know these are seriously ill people but if you look at if you look at you know her record is a terrible record and i'll tell you a good poll because the real paul you know we're doing very well on the polls and and you know they they love the suppression polls this is almost like a replay of four years ago and they said i was going to lose every swing state the day before he will lose every swing state it will be a very short evening right except i won every swing state every single one of them and and most of them pretty easily i mean you take a look at some of these swing states i want them easy and i got 306 remember they said the night before the election there is no way he gets to 270. yeah i didn't i got to 306. in the uh electoral college so you know i mean it's crazy these people it's partly because you focused you focused on jobs and you made campaign promises to people about bringing the economy back which is exactly what happened after the tax legislation the deregulation and your policies around energy but mr president yesterday both biden and harris took shots at you saying look 40 million people are out of work he drove this economy in the into the ground what do you want to say to them knowing that before the coronavirus we were talking about the best economy uh any of us had seen or certainly in a generation but today's numbers do not reflect that and they've got that to throw on you which is well they really don't though because nobody's buying it look we got hit by the china plague and we're not going to forget it we got hit by the china plague i built the greatest economy in history greatest job numbers greatest stock market numbers greatest economic numbers nobody's ever seen it i was i was cruising to election they weren't even going to be a factor george washington would have had a hard time winning you know that it was we were cruising you had to see the numbers and it wasn't even going to be a factor and the market was going to go through the roof because he is an overhang you know having joe biden is a big overhang even on the numbers that you put up every day that are so good there's an overhang because if he got in the numbers would go down thousands of points if he ever won the election so it's an overhang because certainly there's a chance that could happen and that's holding back that's a headwind that's holding back the market as believe it or not as good as the market's been it's up 50 since march as i guess 9 000 i think it's yeah like 9 000 points you never saw anything like it just i'm talking about the new ones going up faster you're right i'll be doing it marie i'll be doing it twice i will have rebuilt it twice but nobody blames me even even the radical left crazies out there this is the first time i've heard this attack nobody's blaming me for the fact that the the you know the the uh call it whatever you want the china virus there's you know there's 20 names for it you have your pick of names right i call it generally the china virus came out of china should have never been allowed to happen but the fact is this plague came in and i closed it up saved millions of lives now we're reopening and i don't know if you saw yesterday but i put up charts that were incredible the the you talk about a v that's like a super v and we're coming back and coming back strong and my biggest headwind is biden because everyone knows that if biden gets in this market's going to crash he's going to build regulations and his taxes he's going to tax people 4 trillion dollars 4 trillion that will destroy this economy the likes of which nobody's ever seen before four trillion dollars in taxes so uh i don't think you know the old days go ahead yep he is true in the old days when you were going to build mr president when you were a politician you talked about tax cuts you didn't talk about tax increases i've never heard of a politician that got elected we are going to increase your taxes this guy's going around and i'm not saying you know i'm not trying to i've never seen it before he got on television two days ago he says no we're going with tax on chris and i'm looking around i'm going maybe we're from a different school he is going to give not tax increases massive tax increases to pay for uh aoc's plan aoc was a poor student at i mean i won't say where she went to school it doesn't matter this is not even a smart person other than she's got a good line of stuff i mean she goes out and she she yaps these guys and they're all afraid of her because if you notice all of these progressives are beating the regular democrats you know you look at elliot engel poor elliott engel he's still going what happened what happened has anybody seen what happened what are the results he lost elliot he got wiped out that's right these people are scaring and yeah and schumer's gonna get beaten by her she's gonna run against schumer and he knows that and he's gonna get beaten by her unless he can talk her out of doing it he has no chance so you think he'll get beaten this november oh chuck schumer will be in my opinion aoc will run against chuck schumer for the senate yeah i mean i think and i think she'll win yes okay tell me about that because that's another thing that they were complaining about you yesterday saying well he's not there negotiating we want to get something done done the democrats have put on the table this three trillion dollar plan what specifically are they pushing for that is causing this breakdown in any deals nancy pelosi said that the democrats uh want to and the white house are still miles apart on on stimulus well they're right and it's their fault they want three and a half billion dollars for something that'll turn out to be fraudulent that's election money basically they want three and a half trillion billion dollars for the mail-in votes okay universal mail and ballots three and a half trips they want 25 billion billion for the post office now they need that money in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots now in the meantime they aren't getting there by the way those are just two items but if they don't get those two items that means you can't have universal mail-in voting because they're not equipped to have it and you see how bad it's been with this carolyn maloney scam she scammed her way into an election she probably lost but they said mail-in ballots it's all mixed up patterson new jersey same thing yesterday virginia 500 000 applications for ballots got sent to everybody nobody even knows he got sent to dogs got sent to dead people nobody has no idea what happened they said oh we made a mistake i'm sorry 500 000 ballots sent in virginia how do you feel about virginia going in there and you have 500 000 phony ballot applications and this is all over there they want no no no that's the only one holding up money for the american people they want mail-in votings and and they want money for the post office this is one of the sticking points that's holding back stimulus for americans during this coronavirus running money for the post office for mail and voting that's one of them that's right how would you like to have maria how would you like to have three and a half billion dollars billion per million voting billion so if you didn't have it you wouldn't you know how much money that is nobody has any idea you know people there are three and a half billion they want 25 billion dollars for the post office because the post office is going to have to go to town to get these great ridiculous ballots in you know there's nothing wrong with getting out and voting you get out and vote they voted during world war one and world war ii and they should have voter id because the democrats scammed the system but two of the items are the post office and the three and a half billion dollars for mail-in voting now if we don't make a deal that means they don't get the money that means they can't have universal mail in voting they just can't have it so you know sort of a crazy thing how many states will be doing those are two of the items but there are many more legislature but how many states are going to be doing mail-in voting mr president a.g barr told me that this opens the floodgates of fraud how many states are you expecting mail-in voting to take place in well you have california where they're sending out tens of millions of ballots they have no idea where they're going or maybe they do maybe they'll go to everybody but republicans but they have california they have many states where you're going to have now i will say it we're challenging in court we're challenging in court so it's being challenged by at many different levels we have many lawsuits out there this will be the greatest fraud in history this will be the most fraudulent this will be almost as fraudulent as obama spying on my campaign but not quite this would be the greatest fraud in history well i'm going to get to that uh and then there's the issue around federal ids you don't even need an id in some places to actually vote you need an id for everything but they don't want people to have identification to show that you are who you say you are when you go to vote it's called voter id it's the greatest thing there is everybody knows it some states like indiana some very well-run states have it but many don't and the democrats are fighting it tooth and nail because they cheat there's only one reason to fight it they cheat if you don't cheat you want to have voter id but many people vote if you look at california we found over a million votes in los angeles over a million judicial watch did they were fantastic job they did tom fitton in that group they did a fantastic job that found over a million votes where people were over a hundred years old and they were voting they had people i think 124 years old that's ridiculous it's a terrible it's a terrible thing that's happened and the democrats don't want to fix it miss mr president let me ask you about these tariffs because you've said that tariffs will remain in place for european union products despite efforts by airbus to move into compliance with the world trade organization what is this about the europeans are giving and subsidizing airbus you are keeping the amount of products subjects to counter measures unchanged seven and a half billion dollars of goods coming from europe well we won that in a lawsuit because they cheated the european union is almost as bad as china you know everybody doesn't like it when i say that they say they're our allies well they take advantage of us tremendously on nato you know they don't pay their dues germany is delinquent for billions and billions and billions of dollars and we're supposed to protect them and they they pay a lot of money to russia for oil and gas the pipeline they pay money to russia billions and billions of dollars and then we're supposed to protect them from russia and on top of everything else they're very delinquent they're paying one percent they're supposed to pay two and the real number should be four or five so uh we get it from every different corner now you know i caught it i'm wise to it and you have a lot of stupid people out there that say oh i'm not treating germany right i'm not being nice to france and you know they take it and by the way i'm very friendly with all the people and they know they smile at me when i look at them they said nobody's ever nobody's ever talked to us like you do you know i got nato to pay 400 billion dollars more a year my biggest fan in the world is secretary general stoltenberg of nato he says i can't believe because we were going down every year for 20 years it was going down down down what they were paying for protection and i came in and it looks like a rocket ship up but still germany's not paying anywhere near what they're supposed to i use the word delinquent they're delinquent they don't pay yeah you you have also you have also changed the conversation on china sir i want to talk to you about that we've got trade talks slated to take place later this week beijing officials are saying that they plan to bring up your ban on american businesses conducting transactions with wechat and tick tock the journal is reporting this morning major corporations like apple disney walmart expressing concerns over wechat in particular mr president are you planning to narrow the ban tell us the threat around wechat and tick tock well we lose for many years 400 500 300 200 billion dollars a year billion with china dealing with china first of all before we even get into security it's been a rip-off the likes of which the world has never seen and i charge massive terrorists and they pay us hundreds they paid us you know just tens of billions of dollars in terrorists as you know they targeted our farmers that i gave them i gave our farmers all of the money that they got targeted for was which was 28 billion dollars over a three-year period so i gave the money to the farmers that's why the farmers love trump you know because i took care of them as opposed to other administrations that forget about the farmers but i took good care of them but i took it out of china now we're getting right now under the trade deal people don't know they said like schumer had no idea he was saying we don't get tariffs anymore he he didn't like tariffs don't want to charge him all of a sudden he thought it was great because so much money comes into us but then he when i made the deal i left the tariffs on which nobody still understands how did i make the deal and still leave the tariffs on and they're buying a lot of corn you know etc etc but with all of that my mindset has changed on china since they allowed the uh the plague to come in and have such a devastating effect on the world us and the world which is terrible but no i view china differently than i did it's before plague and after plague uh right now i view china differently than i did before plague so we just spoke with jimmy ly he's been on the front lines of the hong kong protest he spoke out about what he wants the u.s to to know about the communist party and he also took real issue with xi jinping being dictator for life here's jimmy ly with me just 20 minutes ago sir listen to this it's difficult for them to change you know especially when cjp is the is the president you know xi jinping is totally the motek term kind of hardcore communist he wants to bring china back to the mall time you know all the control right that he's he's is increasing is exactly the way that mao was controlling the country so mr president he's talking about xi jinping as being the problem because he's dictator for life wanting to take china back to the mao dynasty would you like to see xi jinping step down mr president look they're running their country and we're running our country and we have other countries that treat us very badly they treat us like children because we had uh foolish leadership i'm being nice when i use the word foolish but we've had very foolish leadership at the top at the presidential level and all of these countries from china to vietnam to all the asian countries and others many others have taken advantage of us we straightened it out with mexico and with canada we have the new usmca we were in the process of straightening it out with china and then the play came but even before that i had a complete deal with china and four days before it was going to be signed they broke it you know they broke the deal i had so i had to deal with them hong kong is a very complex problem because we've given tremendous amounts of money in the form of incentives to make hong kong free to make hong kong work and to our detriment so i have taken all that back all of those incentives that they had for the hong kong market in order to keep a certain amount of freedom over there knowing they have china looming over the top of them but all of those incentives billions and billions and billions of dollars i gave that we gave to hong kong i've taken back now because it's hong kong is if you use a business term it's owned by china so why should i give this to china hong kong can never succeed without those incentives and hong kong can never succeed having china as opposed to the thousands of geniuses that ran it having china run it so what does it mean for the united states in a very practical sense it means that our markets are going to make a lot more money they're going to use the new york stock exchange they're going to use nasdaq they're going to use our markets uh and the the hong kong markets will go to hell nobody's going to do business very few people are going to do business in hong kong anymore so we've taken it back and we are going to make billions and billions of dollars more because we've taken away all of these very expensive incentives we gave that to them and i fully understood it and i i still understand i was okay with it but once china got aggressive and took it over i took everything back everything's back now and it will fail but look how aggressive they are in america look at how aggressive they are in america able to get insiders at corporations whether it's harvard and the head of the chemistry department cleveland clinic houston consulate getting insiders in corporations to steal intellectual property and send it back to the ccp what happens if microsoft acquires tick tock how many tick tock employees will be working for microsoft and able to send data back to the ccp will you allow microsoft to acquire tick tock so first of all the first thing you know we have got those people and they're being prosecuted under this administration they're being prosecuted number one number two tick tock i broke the deal i said you can't do business in the united states i also said to huawei you can't do business in the united states and i told our so-called allies that are all over the world all of which you know for the most part take advantage of us we have good allies we have some very good allies but some are you know they take advantage of us because for so many years they were allowed to just absolutely rip us off but i've told them i said if you go with huawei that's okay but we're not going to be communicating having to do with intelligence because the intelligence goes right into beijing okay and we don't want that and you know we know that and we have better scientists than they do we have better engineers than they do we know exactly what happened so we explained that to europe and others and for the most part they're not buying huawei and if they do we'll have to cut off intelligence because the intelligence we can't have that go into beijing so we have there's been nobody tougher to china or to russia or to anybody else than i have despite a media that's bought out by china uh much more so than russia do you ever notice they always say russia russia russia they don't mention china china china because most of these people like you look at the nba they're bought off by china and china has you know the big pot of gold so they they say oh let's go let's use russia instead of china but china is a big problem and i've made it a much smaller problem the fact is that with hong kong we're saving a massive amounts of billions of dollars and it's not going to work it can't work it's all based on the dollar i've made the dollar stronger i made the dollar stronger to a point that there is almost no secondary currency the dollar is stronger now than it's ever been and it will be even stronger in my second term and i don't mean just from a price standpoint i'm talking about the pedigree of the dollar unless a biden gets in with his stupid taxes he wants to tax he'll tax his country into a depression like in 1929 if you do what he wants to do his plan and i've been pretty good you have to say maria at predicting things i've been pretty good including saying i was going to win the election and i'm going to win it a second time by the way because you know one of the reasons i'm going to win a second time is people have made a fortune with me and they don't want their 401ks going down by 75 80 or more and that's what's going to happen regulations and taxes he's going to regulate everything put everything back times too i cut more regulations than any president we're going to continue cutting back you talked about capital gains tax cuts you've talked about payroll tax cut you've talked about more deregulation what are the plans for the second term agenda mr president well i've done the payroll tax cut temper you know this is a temporary payroll tax cut but this is a very substantial positive jolt to the economy i'm going to do a capital gains tax cut to 15 in second term we're going to get it down to 15 set 21. we get that down to 15 percent and i'll get that done easily we're going to take the house i believe we're going to take back the house because nancy pelosi is stone cold crazy and i think we're going to take the house and that's upon uh you know i don't make a statement like that uh very easily uh but we're gonna take otherwise i'll look very bad but we're gonna take back the house we're gonna hold the presidency and we're fighting very hard in the senate i'll be honest as the senate is uh uh is uh tough we have a couple of people that aren't as supportive of trump as they should be and those people are going to lose their elections if they don't support trump they lose their elections it's a very simple element look at hagerty in tennessee he was a trump guy and he he just became or he will become very shortly the senator he won the primaries the other day you look at all of the things that have happened but the ones that don't support and i'm just talking take a look the ones that don't support and you have a few people that want to be cute and i think they're going to lose their elections and that's a problem for the senate do you believe school choice will be an issue this upcoming election given the fact that we are in this shutdown and this yeah this is a big issue for minorities in particular well the uh the unions own biden he doesn't even know it joe doesn't even know he's alive but the unions own biden they own the radical left they own pelosi and schumer and they they will do anything for the unions including destroy the future of our children and by the way the union workers i love them they're going to have to work in schools there's nothing more valuable than good teachers teachers are the whole the whole basis for everything i mean we need those teachers that's a very important thing richard trumka was on the show last week mr president and i told him that the income uh the income gap was narrowing before the coronavirus i remember reporting on this because wages were going up so much and he said absolutely not it's not true can you talk to us about what was taking place in terms of the income gap and wages before this coronavirus because i was communicating this just the other day to richard trumka and he said it's not true look uh he totally controls nancy pelosi in fact what we did the usmca he had to sign off on it for her she wouldn't do it unless he signed off and he's a good guy but he's a union guy you know he's good but he's a union guy he does what he can do but if you look at really what was happening before we were actually coming this country was coming together before china sent over the plague this country was coming together because of success somebody said what's going to bring how can the country heal i said one word success and it was happening you know that it was happening we were getting closer people were calling me that i'm talking about democrats that were calling me and talking in a way that was very different from what it had been because we had the best employment numbers we had the best employment numbers we've ever had we had the best numbers we've ever had we had the best stock market numbers we've ever had which now looks like they're going to be supplanted by what we have now if you can even believe that but we had the best success we've ever had and this country was coming together and then the plague hit us from china a gift from china and now we're rebuilding it and it's going up like a v like a rocket and you look at those numbers on automobiles all of this you've gotten so much done economic policy foreign policy naming judges and in the face of all of this resistance first you had the resistance from inside your own government you had the fbi working with the hillary clinton campaign she paid for the dossier they used it to help entrap your campaign then you had the media piling on then you had an impeachment trial with no crimes the uh articles of impeachment were abusive power and obstruction of congress then you had china throw the curve ball at you with the virus democrat mayors and governors refusing to stop crime and vandalism this is all your first term what was most surprising to you as you look toward this new election what was most difficult and most surprising for you in this last three and a half years mr president and by the way when they say abuse of power on impeachment there was a pho it was a phony fake impeachment it was a disgrace on a phone call there was an absolutely perfect phone call right i'm the only one to get impeached on a perfect phone call i like a perfect phone call and i get impeached because of the level of hatred but when they say abusive power the abuse of power is that i get everything done i'm going to have over 300 judges by the end of the first term nobody's ever seen that before i'm going to have two supreme court judges justices and we'll have literally over 300 judges including court of appeals we've done things that nobody's ever done the tax cuts the regulation cuts uh anwar look at anwar they couldn't get anwar done ronald reagan couldn't get it done bush's nobody could get it done and  and i hope they're not going to be politically correct and i hope they do what because the fact is this was president obama knew everything uh vice president biden as dumb as he may be he knew everything and everybody else knew everything maria and you know it and comey and brennan and clapper they all were terrible and they lied to congress and they put flynn they want to put flynn in jail and he didn't lie because the fbi said he didn't lie and we just found that out you know it was only muller that said he lied and they said he didn't lie and they're putting they're trying to destroy that man's life and other people that got in trouble that did nothing by comparison and not in many cases nothing or nothing in comparison they spied on my campaign which is treason they spied both before and after i won think of that using the intelligence apparatus of the united states to take down a president a legally elected president a duly elected president of the united states it's the single biggest political crime in the history of our country and i hope they're doing a job i hope they're not going to be politically correct and say well you know we want to go just get let's get the lower guys that forged the documents going into fisa let's just get a couple of the lower guys i hope they're not going to be bill barr can go down as the greatest attorney general in the history of our country or he can go down as just an average guy it depends on what's going to happen do you want to see a special counsel put in place to ensure that the american people find out what took place here we know that there was an fbi agent who actually changed documents changed evidence we know that there was lying to the court lying to the congress leaking to the media what if if you do not win in november we're not going to hear another word about this so should aj barr probably spend they'll probably cancel it definitely they'll probably cancel it out almost definitely and it's a shame it's a shame but we caught him look we caught him carter page they just used him to spy on the campaign others they used to spy in the campaign it's a disgrace and it could either be unbelievable they don't need a special counsel first of all they have a special counsel working and they have durham working so they don't need another special counsel we've had enough special counsels and frankly everybody knows if you didn't have one bit of evidence from what you already know from reading the newspapers they're all guilty as hell the insurance policy where in case she loses we've got an insurance policy we're going to go and take them out you know that that's what that meant uh with that was with strzok and paige the two lovers the two great lovers that got caught i hope everybody do you think the mueller report was the mueller investigation just a cover-up for what they had done because the mueller investigation we're getting all of the documents now where we're getting this declassification of documents and so we know oh yes they lied to the senate oh yes they lied to the fisa court all of this stuff was available when mueller was doing the investigation so how come he didn't unearth any of this was that just an opportunity to just have all of the documents frozen as a cover-up for what they did to you because they were only interested anything having to do with trump even though they knew all of this stuff strzok and page their text message were all deleted by mueller mueller went in himself and he lied to congress because he said he didn't apply for a job to head the fbi and he did and we have absolute proof of that he came in looking to run the fbi early on the following day he was given the job as the special prosecutor i call it prosecutor because it's not a council they say special counsel it's really a prosecutor so he was given the justice i want to be more accurate and with all of that that they did think of it they spent 48 million dollars plus you don't even know what they spent looked at everything they looked at my taxes i'm sure they looked at everything with all of that no collusion i have a friend who's a very sophisticated man one of the most successful people you know very well he said you have to be the most honest person in the world to escape the greatest witch hunt ever perpetrated in the history of our country to go over every document every phone call everything you've ever done and they say no collusion i did nothing wrong they said i never knew you were that honest he said you must be the most honest man in the world and so then they take it down and they send it to new york well listen we couldn't find anything let's send it into new york into the democrat lions den so they play games there for years it's a disgrace what's going on in this country we've got to stop it we've got to stop it and we're getting close but mr president we know that the f the fbi lied to the senate in february of 2008 christopher wray was running the fbi mr president is christopher wray hiding all of this stuff and protecting the fbi should he step down so christopher ray was put there we have an election coming up i wish he was more forthcoming he certainly hasn't been there are documents that they want to get and that we have said we want to get we're going to find out if he's going to give those documents but certainly he's been very very protective he was put there for good reason he was chosen by a certain person and i said go ahead put whoever you want i'm so honest that i said you could put anybody you want let's see how ray turns out he's going to either turn out one way or the other but i'll tell you bill barr all right and durham have a chance to be bill barr is a chance to be the greatest of all time but if he wants to be politically correct he'll be just another guy because he knows all the answers he knows what they have and it goes right to obama and it goes right to biden they had the meetings that was one meeting they had many meetings that's right we have it all on a timeline right here and mr president i know that we're going to be wrapping up soon but i just want to get your take on these debates there's this movement now in the media trying to get joe biden to not debate you and then you announced yesterday initiatives to help get kids back to school if you could just touch on these two topics before we wrap up here sir first off are you planning these are are we going to have a debate you invited well i want a debate i would say the only problem with the debates is we should have one debate move it forward to have an extra one i don't care three debates is fine or make it four but we should have one before the ballots start going out these phony ballots you know they go out and we should have a debate before the ballots we have a debate a month after the ballots start going out so people are voting without seeing the debate so i think they should move one debate forward or have an extra one put it but i want to do the debates and they are trying to get out of the debates there's no question about that united people that are very good at this stuff so am i i will and i will tell you they wanna they would love to get out of the debates unfortunately yes yeah well i mean look you've you have debated uh pretty aggressively in the past you've also announced yesterday initiatives to help get kids back in the classroom tell me about that this includes 125 million reusable masks go ahead i want to get the schools open they should be open the children if you look statistically it's incredible how strong they are their immune systems they're incredible we have to get our schools open we have to get our country open and a lot of the reason it's not happening is because blue state governors if you take a look at some of the democrat governors they don't want their state open because they think that hurts me on november 3rd and i think people are wise to it our country is going to be stronger than it's ever been next year we're gonna have one of the best years maybe as good as last year it's incredible what's happening when you look at the numbers on cars on on everything retail sales you look at the employment numbers we set a record we're going up despite the democrats this is like i built the wall despite the democrats now nobody wants to talk about it anymore but despite the democrats they don't talk about the wall anymore do you notice they used to talk about it now they don't because it's going to be completed very soon but despite the democrats we have a v going like nobody thought even possible they're impossible they're very difficult people i sometimes think they don't love the country but they're doing the wrong thing but in the meantime i do love your show and i think you're fantastic mr president thank you so much for the time this morning thanks for your leadership sir we'll be watching thank you sir thanks maria
eggs of minnesota to the hills of tennessee across the plains of texas from sea to shining sea from detroit down to houston and new york to l.a where there's pride in every american heart and it's time we stand and save thank you very much this is really great we love this state we won this state i don't know if you know what's going on outside but that's right lou that's as many people as you could possibly have all the way back how did you get in that's my question i know you're special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job and i want to thank you very much for being here but pennsylvania's been very important to me i went to school in pennsylvania as you know college and i love it please sit down and by the time i finish i'm gonna have a nice sunburn right here this is good where's my sunblock but i want to thank everybody in 75 days we're going to win this state we're going to win four more years they've had us under siege and we beat them and we beat them and we keep beating them but i'll tell you you've never seen anything no president should have to go through what we've gone through no president should never happen and i watched president obama last night and i watched him talking about everything and i had to put it out i said yeah but he spied in our campaign and he got caught you know that's about as bad a thing as you can imagine if that happened to another campaign on the other side it have had 25 people in jail for many years already many many years it's a disgrace but in three years and what we've done in just a short period of time there's been no administration that's accomplished what we've accomplished and that's despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts the phony witch hunts no administration has done what we've done we've secured our borders brought back our manufacturing jobs we built our military wiped out the isis caliphate 100 killed our terrorist enemies achieved american energy independence and guess what we're just getting started that's a just a small part of it that's a that's a small part of it at stake in this election is the survi and you know this you know it and i mean it and i've never met it more at stake in this election is the survival of our nation it's true because we're dealing with crazy people on the other side they've gone totally stone cold crazy you know you look at hillary she was a lot smarter than joe but i'll tell you there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago these people have gone insane and their radical left and you look at some of the things happening in these democrat-run cities which we could solve in two minutes all they have to do is call us right our great ex-congressman all they have to do is and thank you for being here but all they have to do is call us we'll be in there in two minutes and we'll take care of the problem joe biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the american way of life they don't understand and probably when it happened they'd say what did we ever do joe biden has pledged to hike your taxes by four trillion dollars in the largest tax hike in history and they're going to waste the money on the green new deals the green new deal you know what you get out of that nothing nothing except debt and death they want to eviscerate the second amendment they want to take away your guns they want to take away your guns well you remember that just that one point alone and they want to take away your guns so who's going to vote for that i mean we want our second amendment i've held it strong and you think it was easy i've held it totally strong give free health care to illegal aliens you don't get free health care expand deadly sanctuary cities force taxpayers to subsidize late term abortion shut down the energy fields of pennsylvania they want to shut them down no fossil fuel no fossil fuel texas isn't too happy either go to texas i just left texas a little while ago two weeks i said they don't want energy they don't want guns and they don't want religion guy stands up says not going to win texas but you have the same thing because you do be you're a big fracking state you want to see your taxes go up stop fracking doesn't hurt you at all fracking they want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses i mean you know put up a big windmill you walk out your door you see this big monster churning but even that they don't want to do i don't think they want to do anything i think they want to close your businesses but just remember second amendment they're going to take it away as sure as you're sitting or standing they're going to take it away from you the second amendment don't let it happen close down charter schools eliminate school choice so important to abolish the suburbs they want to put low-income housing in the suburbs so the american dream and by the way we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs african-american asian-american hispanic-american all did phenomenally last year with jobs best jobs we've ever had in the history of our country best economy we've ever had  but they're a big part of the suburbs and they want to put low-income housing on the suburbs at a level that they've never done it before and it's been a very look this has been going on for 20 years i terminated the regulation that did that they said well we can change i said no let's terminate it people have to aspire to go there they want to aspire to live in the suburbs they want to abolish cash bail releasing 400 000 criminals onto our streets think of no no more cash bill look at what happened in new york cuomo ended cash bail cuomo that wasn't even de blasio that it was cuomo the governor he ended it in new york and now the crime rate has gone through the roof the speaker at biden's convention proudly declared we're talking about abolishing the police we're talking about abolishing ice and we're talking about abolishing prisons and that's the only thing they're not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you've never even heard of before if you want a vision of your life under biden presidency think of the smoldering ruins in minneapolis the violent anarchy of portland the blood-stained sidewalks of chicago and imagine the mayhem coming to your town and every single town in america you're not going to have law and order do you notice and i shouldn't say it because i'll put it in his speech if he can read it which i doubt but they'll put it in there tonight i shouldn't say it because he's going to speak later should have a good audience people are going to find out what the hell's going on i see he hasn't answered a question since they just said i just see it on the newscast since july 17th hasn't taken a question from the fake news back there no think of it i take about 100 questions a day these people you know it's one thing i've learned the uh the people heading these other countries whether it's president xi of china putin of russia erdogan turkey any of them kim jong-un north korea remember we're going to be in war with north korea remember it's going to be a war right congressman there's going to be a war if trump said we're going to have a war no that it would have been a war if yet hillary clinton would have been a war if obama were allowed to stay any longer he thought there was going to be a well where's the war i don't see the war maybe things happen you don't know but there's been no war nobody killed you would have lost 25 30 million people they don't say that they say 100 000 people no no seoul is 32 million people and it's right next to the cannon fire and uh we have a good relationship with him i have a good relationship with him you know when i say that isn't that terrible they say no it's not terrible it's great it's great i have a relationship president obama said when i sat down that first meeting right in the white house he said it was the biggest problem we had in north korea and uh he would have had a big problem would have been a hell of a war tell you right now you'd probably be in that war right now so when i say that we got along and we've met everyone says oh that's so terrible no it's a good thing it's a good thing not a bad thing it's a good thing does it mean bad things don't happen but it's a good thing there's only one thing standing between your family and the radical left-wing mob and that's your vote this november this is a very important i feel like i'm a wall you know we built the wall on the southern border we're gonna have 300 miles by two weeks from now even less 300 miles  and by the end of the year we'll be up to almost 500 miles and then we're going to go on a little bit further some areas that are loose a little bit loose we found out i'm going to put a little bit more about 536 miles going up at a record clip that's doing phenomenally well if you want mobs and criminals you got to vote democrat look because that's what it's about it's they don't talk about law and order now i'm bringing it up now but if they haven't i haven't seen anybody get up i got just the other day endorsed by all the sheriffs of florida all the law enforcement i got endorsed i got endorsed by pennsylvania i got endorsed by texas by ohio i mean i think everybody i don't know how can you endorse somebody else how can how could law enforcement endorse somebody else we gave all of our all of our ex-army equipment you know we have tremendous surplus equipment and it was sitting in warehouses all over the united states hundreds of millions of dollars i distributed it to the police whereas biden and obama they didn't want to do that because they said no no no it makes the police look too strong i want the police to look strong you've got to look strong and a lot of it was protective equipment if you want jobs and you want a lot of police and you want a lack of crime you know if you take away new york and chicago and some of these terrible cities that you see about you know with a crime the crime is so bad i left new york four years ago and i could see because he's a terrible mayor i could see there were things that were happening that were bad he's no rudy giuliani i can tell you that but i could see things were happening but the last six months seven months it just exploded it's incredible crime up 368 percent 368 it's crazy it's crazy but if you want law and order and i can say sometimes they'll say sir say it gently people want to hear gently they want say it gently don't say law and order say if you'd like law and order and safety no i can't do that if you want law and order you gotta have law and order you can't have what's happening in portland did you see the kid get whacked the other day just whacked like he was a piece of garbage i mean who could take it we don't want that and pretty soon we're going to have to send in our people because you know we're supposed to wait till requests i don't know if they're embarrassed or what but these democrat cities they're out of control they have none look at seattle where she said no we want a summer of love i mean this woman is crazy and they would have never taken back seattle except they knew we were going in the next day that's the only reason they even did it so tonight we have slo judo will speak at the democrat convention and i'm sure that he'll just knock him dead and he'll remind us that he was born in scranton but you know he left like 70 years ago right he left a long time ago he wanted one you know i view it differently he'd say he was born here but he left that he was like eight nine or ten so he left 68 years ago he left a long time ago so i view it differently he wasn't born here he abandoned scranton okay his family had something to do with that you know his parents but he loves grant i mean he keeps talking about i was born in screen i lived in scandinavia for a few years and then he left for another state you know the state but the scranton stuff that's why i figured i'd come here and explain to you one thing but i think you people know it better than i do he left he abandoned pennsylvania he abandoned swent he was here for a short period of time and he didn't even know it and today it's amazing it goes around in a circle he still doesn't know it okay but he spent the last half century in washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs and letting other countries steal our jobs mexico china all of them just stealing our jobs he's been there for 47 years and now he's going to come in and make a change i don't think so his son walked out with 1.5 billion dollars to manage that's millions of dollars a year and the sun didn't even have a job before that and i asked the wall street people tell me is that possible smartest people top people on wall street they say can't happen it can't happen the smartest people the people that do get money from every country from everybody they say can't happen he walked out of there in 10 minutes with 1.5 billion dollars he explained that one right and then if they want to look at him nobody looks at him nobody looks at ukraine he gets 83 000 a month and a three million dollar upfront payment because of his great expertise and energy but he had none and he even admitted no i don't know anything about energy but he goes on to an energy company gets millions of dollars 83 it's actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did and is that okay yeah is it okay when joe biden goes and says a billion dollars you're not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors you talk about quid pro quo right that's your quid broke row and they did quid pro quo right and they did they got rid of the prosecutors and then he's called he says now you're getting your money okay figure this how about if that's a republican doing that what happens to that republican it's over it's a disgrace but it's changing slowly too slowly as far as i'm concerned joe biden is no friend of pennsylvania he's actually for the reasons we just said he's your worst nightmare biden supported every single globalist attack on pennsylvania workers nafta china's entry into the world trade organization which built china into a power tpp korea the horrible ridiculous paris climate accord which stripped our nation of its energy and the so-called clean power plan the only good thing about it was the name it was a horrible unfair deal horrible for you and horrible for pennsylvania they want to take your power away you know what your power is your power is the billions of dollars you make on going deep into the earth and taking out what you have to take out everything you want from fracking you you don't realize how big a fracking state does anybody know how big fracking is you're not you're not going to be allowed to frack anymore it's not going to be uh no oil no nothing no oil no gas no nothing just think of that what would happen is you well first of all many of you i guess six hundred thousand six hundred and seventy thousand lose their jobs no money no oil higher taxes your stock market would crash if they get in beyond fracking if they get in you'll have your 401ks which you're setting records by the way stock market just hit a new high and don't forget we've been going through this horrible plague from china it just hit a new high so think of that it's incredible but your 401ks how many people have 401ks here good that's a lot that's a lot how about if they went down to like 10 of what they are now because that can happen that can happen and it will happen if if we're stupid and we don't go out and vote and secure your ballot absentee ballots are good but the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place we'll grab it and we'll just put them in a big pile there everyone grab it it's a disgrace even common sense tells you that look at new york look at what happened in new jersey look at what happened in virginia look at what happened i won't go through the details you know the story they have no control whatsoever in new jersey 20 percent of the ballots were defective fraudulent 20 and that's because they did a good job okay so uh this is just a way they're trying to steal the election and everybody knows that because the only way they're gonna win is by a rigged election i really believe that i saw the crowd outside for every sign we had for trump pence every single sign i never i mean you know but and that's not that atypical in texas we had people on the highways on the roadways we're driving to some oil well where we gave a speech but between it was 20 minute drive between the plane and that oil well there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs trump and trump pence and flags american flags you know when the other side does show up which is rarely they never have an american flag i can always tell if there's a group of people they never you'd never see an american flag the fake news would tell you that but you never see but they don't put it down they'll tell you that personally but they won't write it but you never see an american flag it's an amazing thing but if you look outside today is it a hundred to one two hundred to one and then you'll read tomorrow that biden was well represented he wasn't well there were hardly anybody there every once in a while see a bite not be waving to the people i see a bite and i'd say well i waved to her anyway who cares no but was it a hundred to one i mean it's just massive and you'll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after nafta and china's entry into the wto and that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy joe biden looked american labor into the eyes it took their dues their union endorsements and their votes the unions i mean the unions have to be more reasonable they have to be more reasonable and we love the unions we love non-union we love i've had it all you know i built every building i built in new york was with unions and unions are fine you know a lot of republicans don't want me to say that but i'll tell you unions are fine tell them to keep their dues down please but they're fine and you have unions here you have non-unions but what i talk about is the worker they treated our workers horribly we lost our jobs to foreign lands our workers got fired whether they were in the unions or not then he sold out and he passed the cadillac tax you know what that is on union healthcare plans attacked their energy jobs and sent their factories to china and now he's back begging for their votes and you know people it's like a custom democrats except with me i came in i got so many union votes i get far more i mean you look at you've seen it i've a couple of people either lost their job or came very close that were unbeatable because they led a charge for the democrats for crooked hillary last time they let a charge and the the people in the union didn't want that they didn't want hillary they wanted trump and we had union revolts we call them they revolted but these guys right here are you all union people i can tell are you union it's good right it's fine that's fine look at that you get a hand certain parts of the country they wouldn't be as happy but that's okay right and it's great but they were not happy and you know what was happening they were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the democrats american labor will vote for trump pence in 2020 they're all saying that and this area is going to be an incredible area this used to be all democrat until i came along until i came along this was democrat this was heavily union it was democrat it was everything but they like trump and i'm gonna never let you down and they will let you down they will let you down first of all the country will be let down because the country you will see a crash like you've never seen before and as good as those stock market numbers are there's a headwind the head one is that if he won the market's gonna crash the green new deal all of the different things socialized medicine that's what they want it's socialized medicine no doctor no plan obama lied about it 28 times remember he said you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan it wasn't true 28 different times they have them for the last four years we've been reversing biden's betrayals and delivering historic wins for the people of pennsylvania your state lost over 50 000 manufacturing jobs when biden was vice president in my first three years pennsylvania gained 14 000 jobs manufacturing and going up at a level that nobody's ever seen before we'll catch all of those jobs that were lost they said manufacturing jobs will never come back remember you need a magic wand where's the magic wand well we have the magic one my first week in office i withdrew from the trans-pacific partnership it would have been totally destructive to your jobs it would have been a horror show i withdrew from the one-sided paris climate accord which would have cost us so many billions of dollars and all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world i believe it was designed to hurt the united states and to get jobs away from us and companies i stood up to china's rampant cheating plunder and theft i repealed that horrible tax so many taxes how many taxes did i repeal you know i'm getting a list of them now i'll have it for you for the next meeting because i'll be back to pennsylvania that i promise and i'm standing up to the special interests and the big farmer weeks ago i signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs think of it you know what i did i signed i signed as you know and as you've seen i guess but other countries have sometimes 10 percent of what we pay for the same exact pill same drug same prescription drug and i signed a deal that we get that's not signed by the drug companies they hate it they're taking advertising whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies just remember one thing that means your prices are coming down that means your prices but it was it's called favored nations favored nations we were the least favorite nation in the whole world we paid the highest price so i signed if germany as an example pays 10 cents for a pill and we pay three dollars for the exact same pill we pay 10 cents also now what means is they're going to go up we're going to come way down you could we could drop drug prices by 50 60 or 70 percent at a level that has made them very angry and rebates too i ended rebates rebates go to you nobody else would have done that they could have done that a long time ago biden could have done it he didn't know what it meant but i will tell you most people do know what but they can't do it because big pharma is the most powerful group and i guess they say number one is it number one mr cup but you didn't take any money from big pharma right good i'll bet you didn't uh i'll bet you didn't my man i ended the nafta disaster and i signed usmca into law usmc is phenomenal and it's going to keep your companies from moving to mexico and other places after years of building up other nations we're finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that i've been talking about for years we are finally putting america first and i've done that right from the beginning we're honored to be joined today by some incredible warriors that were really fantastic to me and friends of mine but they really fight these pennsylvania people are fighters in case you haven't noticed representative scott perry scott where scott thank you scott great job scott the warriors lloyd smucker lloyd thank you thank you lord john joyce john thank you great job great job and a friend of mine and a great great man he would have been here forever if he decided to but he decided maybe it was time to do something else but uh this was a fighter like no other fighter and those three other gentlemen will attest right our friend lou barletta lou and they're shouting i'm saying this with the media they're shouting lou they're not booing you know they'll say he stood up and he got booed horribly it was a horrible embarrassing no that's what they do they're fake thanks also to our congressional candidates jim bognett jim oh look at him i've heard good things jim is it easy out there on the stump oh good good and you're gonna win jim you're gonna win and lisa sheller lisa thank you very much great job i hear you two are doing really good if you have any problems call lou he'll help you let me also thank my campaign state chairwoman bernie comfort where are you thank you very much bernie thank you bernie great job you're doing how we doing in pennsylvania okay yeah i think so i think so we don't they did a lot of manipulation also a friend of mine for a long time and a great friend of his father and his maybe his grandfather i don't even i hate to say that because it makes me sound a little bit older than i feel i feel young state gop chairman lawrence tabis what a great family i miss dan tabis you know that dan tabis what a great man he was i don't know if you know him but he started out with about two cents and he ended up being a rich man and he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine he didn't like many people that was long before i ran for politics he didn't like many people but he liked trump right people would go he was a rough guy people would go up to him and say hi dan how you doing he became a very successful guy and he'd look out at me and say i don't want to talk to anybody i just want to talk to trump i like that kind of a guy right but he was a fantastic man actually he's a good man before the china virus invaded our shores we built the greatest economy in history nothing even close we added 7 million jobs nationwide including 209 000 new jobs in pennsylvania by the way in the last three months we ha we right bernie over nine million jobs an all-time record this is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic you notice how they at any time there's a good country they like to compare because we've done an incredible job you look at our mortality rates you look at all the things but they like to compare us to others so they they were talking about new zealand new zealand it's over it's ultra for new zealand everything's gone they're beautiful they had a massive breakout yesterday south korea it's over it's over big breakout yesterday you know it's a tough it's a tough deal we've done a great job we're a big big country and you know maybe this is popular to say maybe it's not i don't care because based on the crowd outside it looks to me like we're going to win this thing but i think by a by the way buy a lot but your governor has you in a shutdown like few what's going on what's going how did they all get out there and they were not socially distant i can tell you we'll have to on the way back they'll still be there because they're incredible people but what is he doing he's got you in a shutdown still shut down wolf he can't do this he's going to destroy your soul you know what happens is depression anxiety problems with family members drugs heart attacks obesity i mean what is he doing it's more dangerous than the virus he's got to open this state up you know when he's going to open it up no i know what he's doing because a lot of them are doing it doing it in the great state of north carolina right they're doing it in north carolina but they're doing it in a lot of different areas but they've got to open this state up and you have to do it right this this wonderful incredible right i would call it a commonwealth do you have a mind if they call it a state no call it commonwealth whatever the hell you want to open it up and what is he doing what is he doing it's very so the commonwealth of pennsylvania we're going to get it open and i know when he's going to do it you know what it is november 4th november 4th he's going to say well we're going to open it up then your results are no better than other states by the way it's not like oh gee this is great it's uh michigan has it closed down and north carolina has a close down and this uh commonwealth has a close down it's really uh it's a very sad thing to see and the results are not good the results it's not like oh this is wonderful the results in some of these places is worse than those that are open and you know you have other states up i mean if you look at the country it's really we have states we're thriving we're thriving and there's no shutdown it's enough we shut it down because we had to we didn't know anything about what was happening we shut it down we learned a lot protect our seniors etc etc you've all heard it but we learned a lot that we opened it up and now we have a big v remember they said the v will never happen we have a big beautiful v we enacted the largest financial relief package in american history and through the paycheck protection program we saved nearly 2 million pennsylvania jobs we've also delivered nearly that's right 2 million jobs we delivered nearly 11 billion dollars in direct support to pennsylvania families and over the past three months we've gained over 9 million jobs it's uh nobody can even believe the numbers and watch the numbers will get better and better because we're opening up and frankly the democrats should do it they should do what's right for the country they know they should open wolfe knows he should open he knows that and how about his uh how about his person with his with the with her mother right with her mother where the mother was protected but the other people weren't you had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes but 95 year old mother as i read and i said well that person will be gone very quickly and that person is still there i would say that's something if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of pennsylvania that would be something good to use so they took the mother out of harm's way and then moved her back when everything was okay and nobody says anything about it and there's no firing retail spending is now at an all-time high who would have believed that auto production has gained 28 percent biden would terminate this unprecedented recovery he wants to impose a permanent lockdown combined with a socialist takeover of the u.s economy did you hear him the other day lock it down he wants to lock it down so everything that we've gained over the last number of months he wants to lock it down no we're doing good florida is going down substantially arizona done a great job in arizona texas going down california's going down it opened these states up and everybody wants to practice good hygiene all of the different things do the masks i mean it's not going to hurt do them do them if you feel it do them but these things these places have to be opened up but november 4th you'll open don't worry about it but that's a long time from now if you think about it right that's a long time from now in biden's policy manifesto written with socialist bernie sanders biden pledges to quickly outlaw american oil he's going to outlaw american oil coal american call he's going to outlaw natural gas which is really an amazing form of energy it clean by mandating net zero carbon emissions from all homes and buildings within nine years and from all power plants by 2035 so he wants to basically get rid of all fossil fuels and you know i know everything about energy i know so much about energy our new forms of alternative energy just aren't powerful enough to power these massive plants and all of the things that are creating all of these jobs and all of this wealth for your state and for the country this week in california there were rolling blackouts because the radical democrats have mandated impossible restrictions on energy production and i see again the forest fires are starting starting again in california i said you got to clean your floors you got to clean your forests they have many many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like like so flammable you touch them it goes up i've been telling them this now for three years but they don't want to listen the environment the environment but they have massive fires again in california maybe we're just going to have to make them pay for it because they don't listen to us we say you got to get rid of the leaves you got to get rid of the debris you got to get rid of the fallen trees you know when a tree falls after 13 to 14 months it becomes extremely dry you look at some of these fires they don't really catch where the trees are growing because they're wet the water's pouring up the tree and they just don't want to listen they mocked us when i said that you gotta clean your floors just an expression clean the floors and they have many many years decades of of leaves dry leaves and everything that's why they have it there are other places forest cities their forests they were developed in forests and they don't have any problem with more flammable trees than you have in california but they just don't want to do it senior citizens were forced to sit in their homes with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer and biden wants to eliminate power plants all across america you had a problem over here but think of that if they do that get used to no air conditioning they probably don't want that either under my administration we ended the war on american energy and i put the miners back to work we put them back to work the miners are back to work now i approve the keystone xl and the dakota access pipelines almost right at the beginning i just approved them right at the beginning and uh a lot of jobs and it's by the way it's cleaner it's a much cleaner form of transportation america is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world think of that one to protect our great steel workers you have a couple of steady steel workers here by the way to protect our great steel workers i placed tariffs on nations that were dumping cheap foreign steel all over the place and we have created an incredible industry out of nothing it was ready to go out within months steel imports dropped by 26 and american steel production surged by 18 million tons almost immediately biden abandoned the steel industry and saved other industries that were worthless but he didn't save the steel industry we saved the seal industry you wouldn't have a steel industry right now when joe biden was vice president the border was an open pipeline for criminals gang members and cartels flooding our schools with drugs under my administration we ended the catch and release horrible catch and release you catch the criminal you take their name you say is this right we don't have identification oh that's okay it's like voting they don't want to have voter id why there's only one reason the democrats don't want voter id you have id for almost everything you have your picture everything nice but not on a vote most important thing you can do is to vote and voter id but they don't want it there's only one reason they don't want voter id and you know what that is right that's really better you guys all in favor by the way of voter id if they if they weren't they wouldn't be congressmen in good standing for uh for very long i'll tell you that we stopped asylum fraud and we deported 20 000 gang members and 423 000 criminal aliens we got him the hell out of our country but if biden is elected all of the security will quickly vanish control of the border will be seated to violent cartels and the left-wing crazies who empower them and you know used to see these massive amounts of illegals coming up from honduras right from guatemala el salvador they'd come up and it'd be just thousands of them you don't see that anymore mexico is putting sev they have right now they have for months 27 000 of their soldiers on our southern border got to do it you got to do it mexico has been really working with us very well i have to tell you the new president of mexico now he's not so new he's been there a little while but the president of mexico has done a great job as far as i'm concerned from the standpoint of our relationship and our relationship with mexico in his joint manifesto with bernie sanders biden has called for a complete suspension of deportations closing down detention facilities ending border prosecutions think of this restoring and expanding catch and release handing out free welfare to new arrivals work permits for illegal crossers and mass amnesty for all illegal aliens can you believe this no this is a bernie said this is bernie plus you know i thought bryden would be taken right this is to show you how good a negotiator is bernie took him left he's supposed to start and they're supposed to meet a little bit left of center maybe for them for us it's right or center but bernie actually took him left along with aoc plus three right aoc plus it's another beauty she's the designer of the green new deal she knows nothing about the environment she probably never studied and asked her how many hours have you taken on the environment biden wants to open your borders in the middle of the pandemic thank goodness we have that 300 miles of wall because you would have had a problem like you never would have seen before i want strong borders and i want safe communities if we don't have borders i was saying this from day one if we don't have borders we don't have a country i imposed a travel ban on jihadist regions to keep terrorists out of our country and it worked and it got approved and the press said he failed and they were right the lower court failed your appeals court failed and i wanted the supreme court so they still say it failed because i lost it the first two courts that's how dishonest they are they say he lost because i lost in the first two courts but we won at the supreme court they forget to mention that fact joe biden has pledged to remove this ban opening the floodgates to terror and terror hot spots and increasing the number of refugees allowed into our country by 700 that's the manifesto of aoc and bernie joe biden and kamala she's another beauty also strongly support the deadly sanctuary cities that have been so bad for you and everybody else as district attorney in san francisco kamala put a drug-dealing illegal alien into a job and jobs program instead of into prison four months later the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman mowed her down with an suv fracturing her skull and ruining her life we believe our country should be a sanctuary for law-abiding americans not for criminal aliens after eight long years joe biden and barack obama left america weak disrespected and endangered we are respected again we are a respected country again they said that one of the leaders called up top top leader of one of the countries he asked me to call president erdogan of turkey who i get along with very well he said sir please would you do me a favor call her to one i said why can't you do it he says you're the only one he respects you're the only person he respects i tell you this story i like telling very personal stories but they did say that you're the only one he'll listen to i said is that because of the united states they said no it's because of you so you know that's not so bad i might as well i might as well tell you the stories because they won't we've invested more than two trillion dollars to rebuild our military our military's in the best shape it's ever been and everything everything is made in the usa and we've revived the historic shipyard in a place called philadelphia with hundreds and hundreds of new jobs you know that and we've just launched space force i never talked about it the campaign trail lou right i never talked about i'm the only one probably that ever ran for office in this country that's achieved more than i said i would i never talked about space force i never talked about it but i realized how important it was that we got it the sixth branch think of that six brands that's a big deal american rockets are once again sending american astronauts into space we renewed nasa it was a field of weeds the field of weeds president obama closed it down we're now sending rockets up and a lot of those rockets are paid by rich people they like sending up rockets for whatever reason they like it i say go ahead you can use pay us a little rent and you can use that properly we withdrew from the disastrous iran nuclear deal a horror show the isis caliphate was destroyed the founder and leader of isis the animal known as al-baghdadi is dead the world's number one terrorist kasim sulaimani is dead joe biden voted for the war in iraq i kept us out of new wars everyone said oh trump is his personnel he'll be in a war's first week instead of that i got you out of wars we're down to a minimum number in iraq afghanistan will be down very shortly to 4 000 troops and that'll come back shortly too syria we took them all out other than were we kept the oil if that's okay with you we kept the oil we have some back and keeping the oil we should have kept the oil in iraq too remember i used to say keep the oil don't go in i'd say don't go into iraq but i was a civilian nobody cared i was like you so nobody cares i want to get that mosquito out of you they'll say it's cruelty to animals i don't know it's true they they have they were saying the other night the shark they were saying no sharks we have to protect them i said wait a minute wait they actually want to remove all the seals in order to save the shark they say wait don't you have it the other way around that's true i'm not a big fan of sharks either i don't know how many votes am i going to lose i have people calling me up sir we want to do we have a fund to save the shark it's called safe the shark i say no thank you i have other things i can contribute to i recognize israel's true capital opened the american embassy in jerusalem and recognized israel and its sovereignty over the golan heights nobody else they talked about it for years for years and years many many presidents talked about the capital of israel jerusalem and they never did it i did it in golan heights 52 years they've been meeting on golan heights i did it last week we reached a historic breakthrough in the middle east finalizing a groundbreaking agreement between israel and the united arab emirates people can't even believe it even the new york times gave us a great editorial they can't even believe it we pass veterans choice and veterans accountability for our great vets nobody's done for the vets what i have nobody not even close we love the vets and federal workers who failed and mistreated our veterans now can be told you're fired that's accountability we couldn't fire them we had sadists we had thieves we had some bad people they let go of 9 000 people in the va they were bad people they didn't love our vets now they have to love our vets in a second term in office we will create 10 million jobs in the next year we will hire more police we will ban sanctuary cities we will appoint prosecutors judges and justices who believe in the rule of law not the rule of that horrible mob that you get to watch on television we will provide school choice in every home we're gonna we're gonna let you have school choice that's a very important thing the democrats don't want anything to do with school choice we will lower the price of prescription drugs as i said we will build and expand our energy infrastructure to a level that is even greater than what we have right now and when i said before we're number one we're number one by a lot nobody thought would ever be number one and we are energy independent which is very nice and as we've been doing we will end our reliance on china and other countries for drugs and other things we will make our critical drugs medicines and supplies here in the united states we will give tax credits to companies to bring jobs back to america and if they don't do it we'll put tariffs on those companies and they'll have to pay us a lot of money so what are they going to do they're going to bring the jobs back in every action every moment and every decision i'm fighting for you i'm fighting for pennsylvania a lot of people got rich and got powerful at your expense now these same liberal hypocrites want to open up orders and let violent mobs rule the streets while they live in waldorf compounds and communities they wanted to fund police while hiring private security they want to let rioters burn churches while jailing you for praying in your church they want to abolish school choice while sending their children to the best private schools in the land they want to cancel you totally cancel you take your job turn your family against you for speaking your mind while they indoctrinate your children with twisted twisted world views that nobody ever thought possible you notice they're not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when i saw what was happening i took an old law and i signed a nice new executive order and then i explained 10 years if you knocked down a statue federal statute or monument and they were all set to march and washington were going to knock down some nice statues and then they said you know what let's not march the march ended very quickly there was no more marching they said you know 10 years that's a long time it's a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don't and there's a way of getting it down you do it through a legal process it'll go quickly if it's right joe biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain but you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for trump pence do we love our vice president do we love our vice president i'll tell you i watched kamala last night and i said i'll take mike i'll take mike by a lot he's been a great vice president actually pennsylvania is the state that gave us the declaration of independence valley forge gettysburg and generations of american patriots just like you you're patriots you love this country that's why you're here you're sitting in this boiling crazy hot sun but you're smarter than me because with you it's on the back of your head with me i'm gonna go home and my wife is going to say what happened you look like a lobster look at the sun this is great i want to look like lou nice and dark right but with lou it's a little easier i think this is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the call and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world and we're going to be stronger than ever before remember that we are already we are going to be stronger than ever before and that's happening right now proud citizens like you helped build this country and and you know this look together we're taking back our country but i was just thinking as i said stronger they want to come in and raise your taxes they want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories and all of your jobs and all of your personal things you know little things and they laugh at it when i say it the light bulb those new expensive light bulbs i said what happened to the old ones they're better they said they were mandated out i said why nobody could explain why i said we're letting them back the light bulbs are back dishwashers they have dishwashers they don't give you any water they give you not enough water so they're lousy so what do people do they press the button again and again no water i let them have lots of water just got back from whirlpool in ohio they're thriving now because of what i did to competition from other countries i tariffed him and whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that's thriving sink faucets shower faucets i won't say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up so i won't say that but you know what i'm talking about they don't allow water you go into a new hotel you turn on the water there's no water i opened it up i said they could have as much water i mean does pennsylvania have a problem with water no yeah you have a problem with water you have too much of it right you have too much water you got to get rid of it so why are we having restrictors they have restrictors on so i took it off these are little things i tell you about them a lot of people appreciate it a lot of people don't know about it but now you can go out buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the course that's better won't last as long but it's better it's better light makes me look much better that's a very important it's a very important thing but you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out and so instead of having it like on for many times longer and actually when i take a shower i can have water hit my hair instead of drop drop it's hard enough my hair without that so now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads okay so a lot of good things we've done a lot of things that nobody talks about nobody writes about but it's about quality of life and i think the people really appreciate it i really do not so easy to do not so easy to do i don't think anybody else could have done it nobody else would have thought to do things like that but nobody else would have would have done it we're returning power to you the american people from scranton to easton how's ernie doing good huh how good is ernie right yeah is he great ernie holmes he was heavyweight heavyweight champ right the chair larry larry sorry about that i know another one named ernie holmes larry holmes is he still in the area of uh how good was larry right that was probably muhammad ali's uh most dangerous fight it was i've never seen anything like it mohammed would never go down but larry holmes was a great champion and i know he loved easton he used to tell me that i want to invest my money in he said i don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing i hope he's doing well but he was one hell of a fighter from scranton to easton to allentown we're going to fight for every job every family every neighborhood and every vote together we'll unite citizens of every race color religion and creed as one people one family one glorious nation under god that's another word they don't want you to say god you know that right did you see they were doing something last night that was extremely basic and always has had the word god and they decided to take the word god out but this is where they're coming from they're coming to get you this is where they're coming from and me we with a wall between the american dream and total insanity and the destruction of the greatest country in the history of the world we're all that stands we're all that stands and a typical republican probably wouldn't get there but i think i'm you know very republican in many ways but your typical republican would not be able to win like your area this has always been a democrat area and yet the votes for trump here are through the roof you know how successful we were four years ago incredible it's a great area these are great people they're great hard-working incredible people and we love them with your drive and devotion we will win a historic victory on november 3rd and we will make america greater than it's ever been before i just want to thank the people of scranton the the lack of home okay the lack of home for joe biden remember the next thing we're going to stop them from saying these things but you look at he's going to make a speech tonight it's going to be very interesting to see how he does and i hope he does well i'll be honest i do i hope he does well i really hope he does well but i also want him to tell the truth he's got to tell the truth about things and he's going to do a lot better if he does but hopefully not well enough right now we are leading a war that's incredible but right now we're leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out we're doing so good in this state in north carolina in florida in texas in ohio in michigan you know how many car plants are being built or expanded in michigan we're doing fantastically in michigan we're doing great in new hampshire these are real polls these aren't suppression polls these aren't polls where they do registered voters register no you want to do voters that are going to vote registered voters you want to do what's called likely voters likely in other words people that are likely to vote not registered voters many of whom have died many of whom aren't going to vote and then you want to do an even count you don't want to do many more democrats they do a poll many right many many democrats few few republicans trump is down by six and then you look and you say well that poll is true we're up by 10. so we're going to see you're going to see they did it last time they had me losing every swing set i think he had to be losing like nine states that i won but he's going to lose right you were the first one that told me lou he's going to lose seven swing states he's going to lose them all he's down by 14 washington post abc they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points the day of the election because we complained that it was a fake poll so they changed it the day of the election and they had us just about even remember that whole big deal we said you can't say we're done because that's called suppression then you say hey i love trump but i can't vote for him because i don't have the time because he's not going to win but if you would have gone out and voted we would have won the problem was last time for them 2016 everybody went out and voted there was no suppression there was incredible exhilaration except except on the other side that they would not you ever see those pictures of the craziness going on but the polls were fake just like their stories are fake just like the news is fake the polls are even worse and we're now actually doing work as one of the most accurate polls was rasmussen and rasmussen came out today did you see it 51 for trump 51.  i think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth sometimes i mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable they refused to release it they didn't want the people to see it what kind of stuff is this that's why you're going to do a great job right you're going to make sure this stuff doesn't happen but we're going to make sure too so we're going to win this and i think we're going to win it really big when you see those people outside and i mean you can take this crowd or multiply at times it looks like a hundred right you can multiply it times 100 but when you see this crowd and when you see the kind of enthusiasm there's nothing like it we're leading by the way even they admit we're leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they've never seen before record numbers meaning we have record enthusiasm and he has a record lack of enthusiasm and that is a big big factor so i just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place i mean it's just a a great great great place i've been here for so long and so much and i love it i love the people we're gonna have the biggest victory we're gonna have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. thank you all very much thank you very much  cause you're in a new town there's  and i'm sure you will find many ways to have a good time  it's fun to stay at the mca it's fun to stay at the fire  enjoy
 friends delegates and distinguished guests please i stand before you tonight honored by your support proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for america over the next four years we begin this evening our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of hurricane laura we are working closely with state and local officials in texas louisiana arkansas mississippi sparing no effort to save lives while the hurricane was fierce one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago and this is due to the great work of fema law enforcement and the individual states i will be going this weekend and congratulations thank you for that great job out there we really appreciate it we are one national family and we will always protect love and care for each other here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy for her incredible service to our nation and its children i want to thank our magnificent first lady i also want to thank my amazing daughter ivanka for that introduction and to all of my children ivanka please stand up thank you and to all of my children and grandchildren i love you more than words can express i know my brother robert is looking down on us right now from heaven he was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing thank you we love you robert let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction our vice president mike pence and mike is joined by his beloved wife a teacher and military mom karen pence thank you karen my fellow americans tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism i profoundly accept this nomination for president of the united states the republican party the party of abraham lincoln goes forward united determined and ready to welcome millions of democrats independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of america and the righteous heart of the american people in a new term as president we will again build the greatest economy in history quickly returning to full employment soaring incomes and record prosperity we will defend america against all threats and protect america against all dangers we will lead america into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement we will rekindle new faith in our values new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country because we understand that america is not a land cloaked in darkness america is the torch that enlightens the entire world gathered here at our beautiful and majestic white house known all over the world as the people's house we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great american story this has been the home of larger than life figures like teddy roosevelt and andrew jackson who rallied americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future within these walls lived tenacious generals like president grant and eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom from these grounds thomas jefferson sent lewis and clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent in the depths of a bloody civil war president abraham lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed washington monument and ask god in his providence to save our nation two weeks after pearl harbor franklin delano roosevelt welcomed winston churchill just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the second world war in recent months our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy like those brave americans before us we are meeting this challenge we are delivering life-saving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year or maybe even sooner we will defeat the virus end the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before what united generations past was an unshakable confidence in america's destiny and an unbreakable faith in the american people they knew that our country is blessed by god and has a special purpose in this world it is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union our westward expansion the abolition of slavery the passage of civil rights the space program and the overthrow of fascism tyranny and communism this towering american spirit has prevailed over every challenge and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor and yet despite all of our greatness as a nation everything we have achieved is now in danger this is the most important election in the history of our country thank you at no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties two visions two philosophies or two agendas this election will decide whether we save the american dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny it will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades your vote will decide whether we protect law abiding americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens and this election will decide whether we will defend the american way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it that won't happen at the democrat national convention joe biden and his party repeatedly assailed america as a land of racial economic and social injustice so tonight i ask you a simple question how can the democrat party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country in the left's backward view they do not see america as the most free just and exceptional nation on earth instead they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them this is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history but in this country we don't look to career politicians for salvation in america we don't turn to government to restore our souls we put our faith in almighty god joe biden is not a savior of america's soul he is the destroyer of america's jobs and have given the chance he will be the destroyer of american greatness for 47 years joe biden took the donations of blue-collar workers gave them hugs and even kisses  and told them he felt their pain and then he flew back to washington and voted to ship our jobs to china and many other distant lands joe biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of american workers offshoring their jobs opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars wars that never ended four years ago i ran for president because i could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer i could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade borders foreign policy and national defense our nato partners as an example were very far behind in their defense payments but at my strong urging they agreed to pay 130 billion dollars more a year the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments and this 130 billion dollars will ultimately go to 400 billion dollars a year and secretary general stoltenberg who heads nato was amazed after watching for so many years and said that president trump did what no one else was able to do thank you from the moment i left my former life behind and it was a good life i have done nothing but fight for you i did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive breaking the cardinal rule of washington politics i kept my promise together we have ended the rule of the failed political class and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary you've seen that they are angry at me because instead of putting them first i very simply said america first thank you days after taking office we shocked the washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration's job-killing trans-pacific partnership i then immediately approved the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines ended the unfair and very costly paris climate accord and secured for the first time american energy independence we passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before within three short years we built the strongest economy in the history of the world washington insiders asked me not to stand up to china they pleaded with me to let china continue stealing our jobs ripping us off and robbing our country blind but i kept my word to the american people we took the toughest boldest strongest and hardest hitting action against china in american history by far they said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace nafta but again they were wrong earlier this year i ended the nafta nightmare and signed the brand new u.s mexico canada agreement into law and right now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in america not firing their employees and not deserting us for other countries in perhaps no area did the washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-american immigration but i refuse to back down and today america's borders are more secure than ever before thank you we ended catch and release stopped asylum fraud took down human traffickers who prey on women and children and we have deported twenty thousand gang members and five hundred thousand criminal aliens we have already built 300 miles of border wall and we are adding 10 new miles every single week the war will soon be complete and it is working beyond our wildest expectations we are joined this evening by members of the border patrol union representing our country's courageous border agents thank you very much for being here thank you brave brave people you see this country loves our law enforcement they do thank you they really do love and respect i learned that the tennessee valley authority laid off hundreds of american workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacement i promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented american workers have been rehired and are back providing power to georgia alabama tennessee kentucky mississippi north carolina and virginia they have their old jobs back and some are here with us this evening please stand you went through a lot please stand thank you thank you very much you've been through a lot thank you very much last month i took on big pharma you think that's easy it's not and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures we passed the decades long awaited right to try right to try we also passed va accountability and va choice our great veterans for taking care of our veterans 91 percent approval rating this month the va given by our veterans first time anything like that's ever happened by the end of my first term we will have approved more than 300 federal judges including two great new supreme court justices and to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform prison reform opportunity zones and long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities and before the china virus came in produced the best unemployment numbers for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans ever recorded and i say very modestly that i have done more for the african-american community than any president since abraham lincoln our first republican president and i have done more in three years for the black community than joe biden has done in 47 years and when i'm reelected the best is yet to come oh oh thank you very much  when i took office the middle east was in total chaos isis was rampaging iran was on the rise and the war in afghanistan had no end in sight i withdrew from the terrible one-sided iran nuclear deal unlike many presidents before me i kept my promise recognized israel's true capital and moved our embassy to jerusalem but not only did we talk about it as a future site we got it built rather than spending one billion dollars on a new building as planned we took an already owned existing building in a better location real estate deal right and opened it at a cost of less than five hundred thousand dollars many things like that that government is doing right now we also recognized israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and this month we achieved the first middle east peace deal in 25 years thank you to uae thank you to israel in addition we obliterated 100 of the isis caliphate and killed its founder and leader abu bakar  al-baghdadi then in a separate operation we eliminated the world's number one terrorist by far kasim solomini unlike previous administrations i have kept america out of new wars and our troops are coming home we have spent nearly 2.5 trillion dollars on completely rebuilding our military which was very badly depleted when i took office as you know this includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors we also launched the space force the first new branch of the united states military since the air force was created almost 75 years ago we have spent the last four years reversing the damage joe biden inflicted over the last 47 years biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime he has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history biden voted for the nafta disaster the single worst trade deal ever enacted he supported china's entry into the world trade organization one of the greatest economic disasters of all time after those biden calamities the united states lost one in four manufacturing jobs we laid off workers in michigan ohio new hampshire pennsylvania and many other states they didn't want to hear biden's hollow words of empathy they wanted their jobs back as vice president he supported the trans-pacific partnership which would have been a death sentence for the u.s auto industry he backed the horrendous south korea trade deal which took many jobs from our country and which i've reversed and made a great deal for our country he repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants he voted for the iraq war he opposed the mission to take out osama bin laden he opposed killing solomani he oversaw the rise of isis and cheered the rise of china as a positive development for america and the world some positive development that's why china supports joe biden and desperately wants him to win i can tell you that upon very good information china would own our country if joe biden got elected unlike biden i will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world they caused in recent months our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that china allowed to spread around the globe they could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out we are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude many americans including me have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease as one nation we mourn we grieve and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary in their honor we will unite in their memory we will overcome and when the china virus hit we launched the largest national mobilization since world war ii invoking the defense production act we produce the world's largest supply of ventilators not a single american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator which is a miracle good job heading the task force by our great vice president thank you very much mark please please stand back we shipped hundreds of millions of masked gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers to protect our nation's seniors we rush supplies testing kits and personal to nursing homes we gave everything you can possibly give and we're still giving it because we're taking care of our senior citizens the army corps of engineers built field hospitals and the navy deployed our great hospital ships we developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world america has tested more than every country in europe put together and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined think of that we have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation which is india we developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma you saw that on sunday night when we announced it that will save thousands and thousands of lives thanks to advances we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it and you look at the numbers it has been reduced by 80 percent since april 80 the united states has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world the european union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours but you don't hear that they don't write about that they don't want to write about that they don't want you to know those things all together the nations of europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the united states think of that we enacted the largest package of financial relief in american history thanks to our paycheck protection program we have saved or supported more than 50 million american jobs that's one of the reasons that we're advancing so rapidly with our economy great job as a result we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation and we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody over the past three months we have gained over nine million jobs and that's a record in the history of our country unfortunately from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize when i took bold action to issue a travel ban on china very early indeed joe biden called it hysterical and xenophobic and then i introduced a ban on europe very early again if we had listened to joe hundreds of thousands more americans would have died instead of following the science joe biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country his shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children families and citizens of all backgrounds the cost of the biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses depression alcohol addiction suicides heart attacks economic devastation job loss and much more joe biden's plan is not a solution to the virus but rather it's a surrender to the virus my administration has a very different approach to save as many lives as possible we are focusing on the science the facts and the data we are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk especially the elderly while allowing lower risk americans to safely return to work and to school and we want to see so many of those great states be open by democrats we want them to be open they have to be open they have to get back to work they have to get back to work and they have to get back to school most importantly we are marshaling america's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time under operation warp speed we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now years ahead of what has been achieved before nobody thought it could ever be done this fast normally it would be years that we did it in a matter of a few months we're producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available we will have a safe and effective vaccine this year and together we will crush the virus at the democrat convention you barely heard a word about their agenda but that's not because they don't have one it's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee joe biden may claim he is an ally of the light but when it comes to his agenda biden wants to keep us completely in the dark he doesn't have a clue he has pledged a four trillion dollar tax hike on almost all american families which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse that means your 401ks that means all of the stocks that you have on the other hand just as i did in my first term i will cut taxes even further for hard-working moms and dads i will not raise taxes i will cut them and very substantially and we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of china back to america and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves america to produce jobs overseas we will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as i've already been doing for quite some time if you've noticed joe biden's agenda is made in china my agenda is made in the usa biden is promised to abolish the production of american oil coal shale and natural gas laying waste to the economies of pennsylvania ohio texas north dakota oklahoma colorado and new mexico destroying those states absolutely destroying those states and others millions of jobs will be lost and energy prices will soar these same policies led to crippling power outages in california just last week everybody saw that tremendous power outage nobody's seen anything like it but we saw that last week in california how can joe biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can't even keep the lights on joe biden's campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform you can't get away from this co-authored with far left senator crazy bernie sanders the biden bernie manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens implementing nationwide catch and release and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers everybody gets a lawyer come on over to our country everybody has a lawyer we have a lawyer for you that's what we need is more lawyers joe biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to your giveaway he was going to give it away your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants which is going to bring massive numbers of immigrants into our country massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to give education health care everything he also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens he promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent this is in the manifesto the biden plan would eliminate america's borders in the middle of a global pandemic and he's even talking about taking the wall down how about that biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools ripping away the ladder of opportunity for black and hispanic children in a second term i will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in america and we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve great people great great people joe biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth democrat leaders talk about moral decency but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving america's soul tonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a god-given right to life during the democrat convention the words under god were removed from the pledge of allegiance not once but twice we will never do that but the fact is this is where they're coming from like it or not this is where they're coming from if the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your second amendment and other constitutional freedoms biden is a trojan horse for socialism if joe biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed marxists like bernie sanders and his fellow radicals and there are many there are many many we see him all the time it's incredible actually then how is he ever going to stand up for you he's not the most dangerous aspect of the biden platform is the attack on public safety the biden bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail immediately releasing 400 000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods when asked if he supports cutting police funding joe biden replied yes absolutely when congresswoman ilhan omar called the minneapolis police department a cancer that is rotten to the root biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement he proudly displayed it shortly later on his website displayed it in big letters make no mistake if you give power to joe biden the radical left will defund police departments all across america they will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide they will make every city look like democrat run portland oregon no one will be safe in biden's america my administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement every day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe and every year many sacrificed their lives in the line of duty one of these incredible americans was detective miostas familia she was part of a team of american heroes called the nypd or new york's finest was very very proud to get their endorsement just the other day great people great great people they were allowed to do their job you'd have no crime in new york rudy giuliani knows that better than anybody thank you rudy three years ago in the fourth of july weekend detective familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge detective familia was a single mom she recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids two years ago i stood in front of the u.s capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored detective familia's extraordinary life it was extraordinary detective familia's three children are with us this evening genesis peter delilah we are so grateful to have you here tonight thank you very much for coming thank you very much thank you very much i promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country and that's the overwhelming majority our noble courageous and honorable we have to give law enforcement our police back their power they are afraid to act they are afraid to lose their pension they are afraid to lose their jobs and by being afraid they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you and those who suffer most are the great people who they protect and who they want to protect at an even higher level when there is police misconduct the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable and it will but when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today we must never allow mob rule we can never allow mob rule in the strongest possible terms the republican party condemns the rioting looting arson and violence we have seen in democrat-run cities all like kenosha minneapolis portland chicago and new york and many others democrat run there is violence and danger in the streets of many democrat-run cities throughout america this problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to just call we're ready to go in we'll take care of your problem in a matter of hours just call we have to wait for the call it's too bad we have to but we have to wait for the call we must always have law and order all federal crimes are being investigated prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law when the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside i signed an order immediately 10 years in prison and it was a miracle it all stopped no more statues they said that's just too long as they looked at a statue i think we'll rip it down then they said 10 years in prison i think that's too long let's go home during their convention joe biden and his supporters remain completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in democrat-run cities they never even mentioned it during their entire convention never once mentioned now they're starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rocking water it's too late joe in the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in minneapolis chicago and other cities joe biden's campaign did not condemn it they donated to it at least 13 members of joe biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals arsonists anarchists looters and rioters from jail here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain david dorn a 38-year veteran of the saint louis police department a great man and a highly respected man by all in june captain doorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect the store from rioters and looters or as the democrats would call them peaceful protesters they call them peaceful protesters we're honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife ann and beloved family members brian and kalyn to each of you we will never forget the heroic legacy of captain david dorn thank you very much for being here thank you thank you very much great man great man as long as i am president we will defend the absolute right of every american citizen to live in security dignity and peace if the democrat party wants to stand with anarchists agitators rioters looters and flag burners that is up to them but i as your president will not be a part of it the republican party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep america safe and salute the american flag last year over 1 000 african americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four democrat run cities the top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by democrats and have been for many decades thousands more african-americans are victims and victims of violent crime in these communities joe biden and the left ignore these american victims i never will if the radical left takes power they will apply their disastrous policies to every city town and suburb in america just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the u.s government just think of that liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of american institutions but who exactly is attacking them who is hiring the radical professors judges and prosecutors who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent in every case the attacks on american institutions are being waged by radical left always remember they are coming after me because i am fighting for you that's what's happening and it's been going on from before i even got elected and remember this they spied on my campaign and they got caught let's see now what happens we must reclaim our independence from the left's repressive mandates americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases and the ever more restrictive political decrees many things have a different name now and the rules are constantly changing the goal of cancel culture is to make decent americans live in fear of being fired expelled shamed humiliated and driven from society as we know it the far left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true very sad but on november 3rd you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget thank you thank you very much  joe biden is weak he takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage these same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land they want to open our borders while living in waldorf compounds and communities in the best neighborhoods in the world they wanted to fund the police while they have armed guards for themselves this november we must turn the page forever on this failed political class the fact is i'm here what's the name of that building but i'll say it differently the fact is we're here and they're not to me one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world and it's not a building it's a home as far as i'm concerned not even a house it's a home it's a wonderful place with an incredible history but it's all because of you together we will write the next chapter of

till dusk these pioneers didn't have money they didn't have fame but they had each other they love their families they love their country and they loved their god when opportunity beckoned they picked up their bibles packed up their belongings climbed into their covered wagons and set out west for the next adventure ranchers and miners cowboys and sheriffs farmers and settlers they pressed on past

fear but america didn't stop there we looked into the sky and kept pressing onward we built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space we did it so the two brave patriots

highly respected person actually thank you very much thank you very much great thank you so much for your rapid response and the fact that that you're coming to a small city in the united states and just saying that that's as important as every other city and the fact that we did get things under control uh this guard has been phenomenal our law enforcement people have been working together we usually work pretty well together in southeastern wisconsin yeah but this really helps and reince has a lot to do with that too you can tell because you're good so thank you so much you're in our prayer thank you and you your reputations a great one so thank you very much and also this this area is a special area we can't let that happen to this area so we got here quickly and uh did the job violent mobs demolished or damaged at least 25 businesses burned down public buildings and threw bricks at police officers which your police officers won't stand for and they didn't stand for it these are not acts of peaceful protest but really domestic terror my administration coordinated with the state and local authorities to very very swiftly deploy the national guard surge federal law enforcement to kenosha and stop the violence and i strongly support the use of the national guard in other cities and the same thing would be happening if we did that you'd have the same thing happen in portland it would happen very quickly it would all be over very very quickly and i just want to thank the two of you for acting so strongly and so bravely and getting it done and the coordination has been fantastic you still need that coordination no matter how many people you send in i just came from a visit of one of the businesses that was burned down b l furniture and the great 109 year old camera shop which i i really respect because that was a had a reputation far beyond the state even and it's terrible to see several other business owners uh they're joining us and we have some in the back also to stop the political violence we must also confront the radical ideology that includes this violence reckless far-left politicians continue to push the destructive message that our nation and our law enforcement are oppressive or racist they'll throw out any word that comes to them actually we must give far greater support to our law enforcement it's all about giving them additional support these are great people these are great great people these are brave people they're fighting to save people that they've never met before in many cases and they're incredible we must really be thankful that we have them and we have to help them do their jobs we can't be threatening them with their pensions are going to be taken away their job's going to be taken away everything's going to be taken away they're going to be living a bad life if if they utter an incorrect word you can't do it we have to have our law enforcement we cherish our law enforcement we wouldn't be here without our law enforcement even me i'm here today i feel so safe and you went through hell just a few days ago but i feel so safe i better be safe i better be safe but we're all safe and we're safe because of law enforcement and we honor you and i will say this we have to condemn the dangerous anti-police rhetoric it's getting more and more it's very unfair you have some bad apples we all know that and those will be taken care of through the system and nobody's going to be easy on them either and you have people that joke they're under tremendous i said it yesterday i said it last night they're under tremendous pressure and they may be there for 15 years and have a spotless record and all of a sudden they're faced with the decision they have a quarter of a second quarter of a second to make a decision and if they make a wrong decision one way or the other they're either dead or they're in big trouble and people have to understand that they choke sometimes and it's a very tough situation right it's a very tough then people call them bad and horrible and they made a bad decision but if you think of it when they have and i know you practice this all the time where you give people uh literally a quarter of a second to make a decision and a lot of them can't make that right decision it's a very tough thing to do the vast and overwhelming majority of police officers are honorable courageous and devoted public servants they're incredible yet many politicians ignore their sacrifice and ignore the african-american hispanic american victims we have people there was love on the streets i can tell you of wisconsin when we were coming in there was love on the streets and so many african-americans hispanic americans i can see waving pastor was so beautiful to see they want to have they want to have safety they want to have safety you look at i'm not a huge believer in polls obviously but you look at polls whether it's 87 percent want to have great police they want to have strong police they want to have safety they're the ones that are most affected by tragedies like you'll see going around when these allegations of police wrongdoing and when you see that they have made allegations they must be fully and fairly investigated and that's what we're doing bill barr has done a fantastic job in that respect and we fully understand that because you do you do have problems the other way but there are very few you know the sad thing is you can do 10 000 great jobs as a policeman or policewoman you can do an incredible job for years and then you have one bad apple or something happens that's bad and that's the nightly news for three weeks that's all they talk about they don't talk about the thousands and thousands of good jobs the lives that you save they never talk about so i'm committed to helping kenosha rebuild we all are we will provide one million dollars to the kenosha law enforcement so that you have some extra money to go out and do what you have to do you took a rough it was a rough week to put it mildly and you've done it incredibly well i'm also providing nearly four million dollars to support these small businesses that i talked about today that got burned up burned down and we're going to be providing over 42 million dollars to support public safety statewide including direct support for law enforcement and funding for additional prosecutors to punish criminals and resources to provide services to victims of crime and that was bill barr wanted that money put in so that's 42 million dollars that will help with prosecutors and all of the other things that are so important to you you need that because when you when you grab them and then nothing happens and they're back on the street that doesn't work out too well my administration is restoring public safety we're hiring more police surging tough one crime federal prosecutors increasing penalties for assaulting law enforcement and for dismantling antifa it doesn't they don't want to mention the word antifa nobody mentions that there's a bad group of people very very bad very dangerous group of people and we are doing a big number on antifa they're bad earlier this year we announced operation legend to surge federal law enforcement to high crime neighborhoods it is a thing that has really worked out amazingly well bill but it's really under sort of really understated in a sense we we've already conducted more than one 000 arrests in our first month in chicago we went to chicago very recently obviously that's been a disaster chicago total disaster with again radical left democrat and we just have to straight it's all democrat everything's democrat all of these problems are democrat cities we don't want to say it but it is the top ten or democrat then you go into the top 25 and take a look at that it's the same thing we cut the number of murders in chicago last month in half still way too many but the operation legend was very very very successful now it's just really getting going but they cut it in half and just at its very early stage this in sharp contrast to those who want to slash police funding oppose using the national guard and want to hire radical judges and prosecutors who will release riders looters and criminals we have that in portland where the prosecutors don't want to do anything you can catch somebody doing the worst crime and they don't want to do anything so we're very very uh not going to be cut police funding we want to increase police funding substantially they want to end cash bail which has been a killer for new york if you look at what's happening in new york they allow thousands of people out of jail in new york and they're walking around and they're causing nothing but problems who would not know that you don't have to know anything about policing i'm not a policeman but i would know that if you let these people out many of them are going to cause tremendous problems so they want to end cash bail incentivize prison closures they want to close the prison so that can't hold anybody reimagine public safety end immigration enforcement resume catch and release at the border uh as uh chad will tell you we've had tremendous success on the border we're up to over 300 miles of border wall and we're having the best year we've ever had in the border people are coming in but they only come in legally or they for the most part they only come in illegally the wall will be finished very shortly it's had a tremendous impact so and the other thing we want to appoint supreme court justices and judges we'll be up to almost 300 judges by the end of the term and two supreme court justices and so we have a lot of things to do we have a lot of great things to do but it's an honor to be in your neighborhood it's an honor to be in your great state wisconsin and we're here for you all the way some people thought it would be a good thing for me to come a bad thing i just wanted to come i really came today to thank law enforcement and to just really that what they what you've done has been incredible it's been really inspiring because you see it happening all over and it just never seems to end and it never seems to end because it's almost as though they don't want it to end because you ended it really fast and congressman i want to thank you for the job you did you were the first call and i want to thank you very much brian great really great job with that i'd like to introduce bill barr attorney general of the united states say a few words thank you thank you mr president um as most of you know whenever there is an officer involved shooting in our country uh it's reviewed by local uh authorities uh to ensure that it was reasonable force and when there are questions raised about it the federal government also the justice department also reviews it and like all procedures and processes in our country we do it under due process and we try to reach a dispassionate reasoned decision based on an analysis of the situation we do not allow judgments to be reached because of mob violence we do not have mob violence in this country make our decisions over the fate of individuals when when their actions are challenged and when the shooting occurred uh here in kenosha under the direction of the president we told the dod the defense department to get ready some national guard units in case they were needed to help here and from several states volunteered to supply national guard if they were needed and the president directed me to assemble a group of federal law enforcement that could be dispatched here uh which we did and staged them in chicago and we were picking up information that that these violent instigators were coming to kenosha they were coming from california washington state a lot from chicago and they were coming up to kenosha so we expected matters to get worse the violence that erupted shortly after the shooting is simply not a legitimate response to a police shooting and the looting and the arson were unacceptable and as it progressed it became more and more distant from the issue of racial justice it was violence for violence sake and once again we saw the hijacking of a protest by a hardcore group of of radicals who were carrying out planning a coordinated violent attack on law enforcement on public property and on private property and that can't be tolerated these are the the same people many of them who came from out of town out of 175 arrests a hundred were from out of town and some these are the same people using the same tactics that have been used in various cities washington dc atlanta chicago now kenosha portland and they use these black block tactics throwing projectiles at police and literally trying to inflict injuries on police arson and rioting they came equipped as even the mayor of washington acknowledged they come equipped to fight and it's completely unacceptable and the state is the first line of defense if if local leaders are committed to keeping the public safe it can be done and while it was slow in getting off the starting block this is an example that when you have the local political leadership backing the police you have the state willing to put in the resources in terms of national guard and the federal government able to come up uh with support such as the fbi the marshals and atf who have some special skills and forensic ability to help there will be peace on the streets and there's going to be accountability what people don't see is that in all of these cities there are task forces of federal and state officers reviewing all the video that we can get our hands on and when we are able to identify people who committed crimes in these riots going all the way back to the beginning whether they're burning police cars or throwing rocks at people which are deadly they will be prosecuted that's a large-scale effort and it's going to continue so i can i can tell you mr president that as far as the federal government is concerned we welcome the opportunity to work with state and local to deal with this public safety issue law enforcement is used to working together we do a good job when we're allowed to work together this is no different than dealing with violent crime where we work together we can achieve results and the federal government is willing to use all our tools and all our laws to bring these people to justice thank you thank you very much you're doing a great job bill thank you senator ron johnson from your wonderful state and he is one of the great senators i can tell you that in the u.s senate he's one of the best ron please there's no doubt what you've been talking about in terms of the decisiveness the resolve the surging of resources i think 44 different counties sent representatives from different sheriff departments that really helped stop the rioting and and bring pieces the streets but we have you know pastor ward and his wife and and i reached out because i was just so appreciative of julie jackson's words of forgiveness and of healing and so you combine the proper role of law enforcement the support for law enforcement with people that also want to end the violence that are willing to forgive and are willing to offer those words of healing so i thought that was very powerful i was really appreciative offer those words forgiveness and trying to attain that type of unity and healing so again mr president i thank you for coming here for for coming here to thank law enforcement to support law enforcement but also coming here just to support the citizens of kenosha and wisconsin as we rebuild as as we recover from something that the vast majority people abhor and do not support thank you very much ron appreciate it congressman please brian style mr president i appreciate you being here as events spiraled out of control um people started calling me they were scared they were nervous they were concerned about their safety their family's safety their home their place of employment and they were looking for where to turn it was very clear from talking to folks here in the city of kenosha local elected leaders that we needed additional resources in the community of kenosha immediately that's ultimately why i called you on tuesday morning and after only seven minutes you got on the phone with me you said brian i'm there for the people of kenosha and the people of kenosha everyone that called me wanted public safety here in this community and they wanted it immediately they didn't care if the help was democrat republican or from the man on the moon but what you did is made the call and said enough's enough we need to get resources into the community of kenosha and ultimately when that offer was accepted i think it became very clear to the criminal element that they knew that kenosha meant business we made some significant arrests in conjunction with local law enforcement working very well with the federal government hand in glove when i talked to folks in law enforcement here in kenosha and when the federal government works hand in hand with the state and with local government you can get a lot done and i think it speaks volumes about the people here in the community of kenosha this is a hard-working family loving town that wants safety in their community and one more piece is i've had the opportunity to talk to a lot of the men and women in law enforcement those on the front lines i spoke to a gentleman that had a brick thrown at him i've spoken to law enforcement officers who had horrific words said about them and these men and women are members of our community that wake up every day put the badge over their heart walk out the door sworn to answer the call to protect our community and i think you coming and saying thank you to those men and women in law enforcement speaks volumes and today we have public safety restored we appreciate all the work you did on that and now we begin the work of healing and rebuilding kenosha to make kenosha stronger than it's ever been before we thank you very much for being here thank you brian great job david beth sheriff please mr president thank you so much for being here um when this started sunday night we knew it was going to get worse but we really didn't know how bad and there's no way that one or in our case two agencies can work together to fight what happened when we put out the call initially to the state and local law enforcement here it was a tremendous response but it still wasn't enough on monday night the national guard started coming on monday night and started helping us and their numbers kept growing and we called brian on tuesday morning early the the leaders of kenosha and we said we'll take help from whoever will send it our way will we want to protect the people of kenosha the city of kenosha the county of kenosha we want to protect it and brian said i'm going to make a phone call and a short time later we knew that the resources of the of the united states of the federal government and of the president were on its way and we we knew that it took a little a little uh uh discussion between state and federal levels and but we're very thankful that it worked out because as i said i didn't care who i got help from i wanted resources here and after it was approved uh and i got the word that the president said whatever you need it's coming and i had some of uh some very very important people from washington tell me the president i have to report to the president mr barr and tell him what does the sheriff want and and the resources just kept coming the people kept coming the uh the gratitude kept coming for and i heard stories and i probably shouldn't share this but some people that were in portland that weren't treated as good as they were treated here and they said we can't believe what a different place this is because of how we all worked together rather than not wanting to work together at all so thank you for being the president that likes law enforcement on behalf of law enforcement i'm telling you the group that's here i hope you could feel the love that they have for you and everybody who came and and uh it's quite an operation to watch to be part of in truth my life my life i never thought i would see anything like this and hopefully i never have to see this again but the resources that that in this case the federal government and you provided and mr barr and and mr johnson and the people here it's unbelievable what we have here right now and uh it's all to protect the people of kenosha and and uh i still i'll take any help i can get and i thank you for it thank you sheriff i'll tell you you've done a great job and you know just if they're watching portland or chicago or new york or any one of other cities that we're talking about but portland probably would be so easy maybe that would be the first one because i see it every night it's on the news it's burning they're always playing games and i don't know then he gets up and says we're trying to work together and the whole thing is great then they want to burn down his house last night the mayor but we're ready willing and able to send in you know a massive group of people that are really highly trained you saw that they're here your experience right and we could solve that problem in less than an hour in portland so i hope they call eventually they'll call and at some point bill would just have to do it ourselves we're gonna have to do something that's uh that i think the people will be extremely happy with maybe the mayor won't and maybe the governor won't but i don't know if they know what they're doing i just so sad to watch it happen but here you acted and acted appropriately please daniel go ahead mr president first of all thank you for the support thank you for coming to what is uh small town america kenosha's 100 000 people by national standards we're still small but what you also have here is a reaction to was an attack on small town america the tactics that are being used across this nation to attack law enforcement are warfare type tactics and we still use restraint and function within our rules so those two together there's not a there's not a tit for attack those aren't equal so with the ability of the national guard to come out and assist us with the tremendous outpouring of support from the federal assets from every department that has come out we will excuse me we were able to restore peace and we're working toward order and and healing and growth and as part of what is going on in the world police scrutiny is not a bad thing police or attacks on the police and the things that are happening that lead to riots that's not about police scrutiny that's not about anything else those are those are legitimate attacks so what worked for us was we certainly had a unified command we had a unified mission that normally takes some time to build but instantly between myself and the sheriff and the local leaders the city administration county we pulled together we worked with the city we worked with state we worked with officers from southeast of here and there's not a lot southeast of wisconsin or kenosha to the northwest corner of the state we have people from two steps away from canada sending officers down here so the response here in the law enforcement community was tremendous and everybody i talked to was here to help restore peace and order for the good people of kenosha and thank you for helping us thank you daniel great job you did thank you and you two worked together beautifully it's really good really good job uh please chad well thank you mr president uh americans need and deserve both law enforcement and public safety regardless of where they live regardless of their politics the decrease in violence that we've seen here in kenosha over the last several days is really just a prime example of how federal state and local law enforcement can work together it's really a model that we can replicate elsewhere portland and other cities across the country and this administration mr president you've been very clear if cities need help they need assistance if they need resources and capabilities beyond their reach all they have to do is call law enforcement the federal government and we will be there dhs partners not only with the department of justice but with local communities every day to protect the citizens of those communities we're providing law enforcement here in kenosha some assistance uh until you're able to rebuild and get back on your feet so um certainly want to uh extend our appreciation for what you do and let me just say um the attacks on law enforcement recently have been very vocal about that uh are very disgusting we need to thank our men and women of law enforcement they put on a badge and a uniform every day they're attacked every day for simply wearing that uniform and doing their job so again on behalf of the 240 000 men and women of the department i want to say thank you to the local law enforcement for doing your job and protecting your communities thank you really nice thank you pastors would you like to say a prayer yes sir i'd love to have that uh because you are so highly thought of in the area so please james sharon you still pray please father we come to you in the name of our lord jesus christ and we thank you for this time that you've divinely ordained father we ask you to forgive us all where we've strayed from your ways and well we've not acknowledged your word we ask that you would continue to cause this nation to be one nation under god that you alone are the one who can make us individual indivisible and by being indivisible there will be liberty and justice for all we simply pray that you would bring our nation back to you that your word will be dominant that you would cause us to walk in love to live in love restore empathy and compassion kindness concern for each other lord i pray for our president as your word says that you would strengthen him and continue to give him the wisdom and the heart to lead during this time as well as as all the leaders that are here we give ourselves to you and we ask you for your good hand to be upon us in the name of jesus our lord we pray amen amen thank you very much sharon would you like to say something i i would um i think i'm here first of all representing intercessors and people that are praying just really i think we need to mobilize people in prayer to pray for this country and also i think it's important to have black people at the table um to help you know solve the problem and also um i think james and i are our prayers that we're able to work to really bring about a change i think there's a lot of great change that's been mentioned here of how law enforcement has quickly solved the problem of the crime in the street but i think there's i think this is a good opportunity for us to really solve the problem the nation and um i think james and i could help with that so that's really well put yes james mr president if i may add being the only pastors in the room if i could maybe just share a little bit from a different perspective that i think would bring balance i have a great friend who is chief tony scarpelli the chief of police in the town where our church is right and i talk about the partnership between pastors and police and i often tell tony that if we can do our job well it will make his his job easier that's because there are three types of law that govern society there's spiritual law moral law and civil law most of the conversation here today has been about civil law but until we can really focus on spiritual and moral law and change the hearts of people we'll have to continue to to build bigger jails and bigger princes prisons until we can bring our nation back to the place of spiritual and moral law we certainly want to honor julia jackson we're her pastors we're not the pastor of the entire family but on her you know yes sir i will give her your regards and we certainly pray for jacob's continued healing and we pray for peace but i just want to offer to you mr president that um jesus himself says blessed are the peacemakers and we want to help be of service to you and to our nation of having these conversations of how do we rebuild the foundations of spirituality and morality which gives us the context of of love if you give a righteous good moral man the launch goes to our nuclear arsenal everyone will be safe because he's a good man but if you give a malicious man who is immoral an ink pen you have to fear for your life i i would just want to want to say that we're here to be of service to you and to our country to bring unity we believe that we can help to listen with empathy and compassion to the real pain that that hurts black americans but we want to be of service to you and to our nation to do whatever we can to bring true healing true peace and to really see god's very best in our nation we're here available we're available anytime you will call upon us so you know what i think i think you're an incredible couple i really do i think you're an incredible couple thank you and thank you very much for being here yes sir really really great beautiful uh do you have any questions you'd like to please in federal agents for cities like portland no it's not but yeah no it's not it's just that we're tired of watching every night with portland they're on night 104 now and we're tired of watching it because it could be solved in an hour and we're tired of watching a mayor that has no clue what's going on and people are calling our office and people are calling washington that live in portland and live in the state and they're saying please please send help and the governor we call the governor often and they say no we don't need your help but i say your community is burning down they don't need our help now i don't know if that's political i don't know what is going on certainly not common sense but we can solve it just like here we all work together we came in the federal government the state government the city government everybody worked together the senator the congressman it was like a beautiful thing it just came it just worked and it was done almost instantly people were amazed and as you probably will have to report maybe people are surprised there's been zero problem in terms of your safety our safety i feel so safe four four or five days ago james we couldn't have done this the law enforcement's been so great and we could do this in portland so quickly so easily it would it would be incredible we would have done it in seattle we were all set to go into seattle as you know the following day and they heard that and they sent the police and the police did a good job but they the people gave up they were exhausted they were there for a long time and they gave up they were exhausted so we're there i mean we'd love to help oregon we'd love to help really love to help portland because we could solve that problem so easily we have the people there ready they could be there in less than an hour less than an hour and it would all end and they got a glimpse of that in this great state they got a really good glimpse of it it happened very quickly and now i mean i see it they're already rebuilding you're already rebuilding your stores you'll be rebuilding your store soon your camera shop so uh we don't want to do that but at some point we're going to have to do it we're going to have to do it okay can you tell me what you would say to the blake family i know you didn't get a chance to talk to them but what would you say to them in terms of the pain they're going through and the questions they have about what happened well i feel terribly for anybody that goes through that that's why i was so honored to meet the pastors uh i feel terribly for anybody that goes through that as you know it's under investigation it's a big thing happening right now i guess it's under local investigation i know bill you're also participating but it's under your local investigation group unit and i hope they come up with the right answer it's a complicated subject to be honest with you but i feel terribly for anybody that has to go through and i didn't get to speak to the mother i hear she's a fine woman i've heard that from the pastor a really fine woman but you can see when i spoke to the pastors i see exactly what it is and they understand where i am and if we can help we're going to help but it is a question it's under investigation a lot of things happened with that and other things frankly that we're looking at very very closely okay should every police officer in the united states wear a body camera body cam uh well that's very interesting let me ask bill to answer that question go ahead well generally that's that's a local uh issue for each police force in each community the political leaders of a community to decide upon but i think most law enforcement people i know uh who were originally skeptical of body cameras are now coming around to feeling that they actually are a net benefit it's a very tough you know it's a very the whole thing with a body cam you read it and you read two sides of the story how do you feel about it daniel i believe that body cameras would be very helpful for you you think they're good i believe they show both sides where right now officers would be vindicated for some of the things that they've been accused of and certainly if there were inappropriate actions those would be captured but you overall i support them how about you we're good with it or it's already been put into the budget for 2021 and uh okay so you'll be having them we'll be having them okay good they like them questions um the problem of police violence has been described as just the problem of a few bad apples repeatedly you're gonna have to speak up please yeah uh the problem of police violence has been described by you including president uh as just bad apples few bad apples or people who choke occasionally some african-american community leaders and a lot of others actually have said it's systemic where do you stand on that i don't believe that no i don't believe that i think the police do an incredible job and i think you do have some bad apples i think you'd agree every once in a while you'll see something and and you do have the other situation too where they're under this tremendous pressure and they they don't handle it well they call it choking and it happens and no but i don't believe that at all i think they're i've met so many police i have the endorsement of like so many maybe everybody and frankly i think they're incredible people they want to do the right thing it's a tough job it's a tough job it's a dangerous job but i have to say this to the police the the people of our country love you you don't hear that you don't hear it from them but the people of our country love you and they respect you and they and you know it you feel it in your heart or you wouldn't be doing it or you wouldn't be doing it but there's a great love and when they see what goes on and when they see a case like this where it's solved so quickly they respect the police a lot really a lot so you should hear it at least follow on that um we're focusing on violent uh actions but there have been countless non-violent protests here in wisconsin and across the country this summer uh people calling for an end to systemic racism do you believe systemic racism is a problem in this country well you know you just keep getting back to the opposite subject we should talk about the kind of violence that we've seen in portland and here and other places it's tremendous violence you always get to the other side well what do you think about this or that the fact is that we've seen tremendous violence and we will put it out very very quickly if given the chance and that's what this is all about yeah i keep hearing about peaceful protests i hear it about everything and then i come into an area like this and i see the town is burned down i mean you look at minneapolis they should have acted much quicker when we got the national guard in there it took literally a half an hour you saw the scene they formed they walked it was over and they haven't had a problem of any consequence since their police weren't allowed to do the job that they could do they're very good police department but they weren't now they want to break it up they want to end it they don't want to have a police department they want to not only defund they want to get rid of it it's ridiculous so i just say this that the kind of violence that i saw you may have protesters but you have some really bad people too you have anarchists and you have the looters and you have the writers you have all types you have agitators and that's what you should be focusing on with your question i keep hearing about peaceful protests it's become really i think it's hurt the media very badly because you'll have somebody standing on one of the networks i won't say which one but there are more than one many of them seeing how it's a peaceful protest and over the shoulder you see the whole place is burning down it's become a pretty common sight so i don't view the peaceful protest i think peaceful protesting is fantastic i think it's great but by and large this is not peaceful protest when you walk into a an area and you see buildings that have burned down and fortunately here we stopped it early and so the damage is relatively minimal but when you look at some of these areas that they just don't ask for the help they refuse to allow us to go in and help them and by the time you get there the place is is disintegrated and then they say it was a peaceful protest it's not a peaceful protest and you shouldn't call it a peaceful protest okay one more please answer my question my question was to the pastors say it again the peaceful protests that have happened you're gonna have to speak up the peaceful protests that have happened you've acknowledged some of them are peaceful they're calling for structural change mr blake was shot i mean seven times in the back do you believe that there is a need for structural change what is your message well i think people are calling for structural change and then you could take the people of kenosha that aren't here and that you won't see and that aren't protesting but they want change also they want to see law and order that's the change they want they want law and order they want the police to be police they want the police to do what they do better than anybody else in the world and that's what they want too you don't see them marching and you don't see them on the streets but what they want is they want great police force they want people that are going to keep them safe where their houses aren't broken into where they're not raped and murdered that's what they want and they're protesters too but they don't walk down the street up and down the street so you know just the way it is just the way it is so i want to thank you all and i'll see you back at the plane thank you very much thank you thank you great job fantastic job thank you everybody thank you very much appreciate it

to secretary carson secretary devos dr larry yarn educators students and participants and all those looking on for this white house conference on american history welcome to the national archives it's an honor to be with you all please today is constitution day a day in which we celebrate the work of genius that's preserved in these very halls 233 years ago today our founders completed what for them was the work of a nation but for humanity a work for the ages the constitution of the united states of america for the first time in history a government was founded by we the people to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity john adams our first vice president aptly described our constitution in his words as quote the single greatest effort of national deliberation that the world has ever seen and so it was but we all know the summer of 1787 didn't just happen it was preceded by the summer of 1776 in the signing of our declaration of independence whose magisterial words continue to echo into our time that we as americans hold certain truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness with those words america laid the foundations for a government whose purpose in the words of president abraham lincoln was and i quote to elevate the condition of men to lift artificial weights from all shoulders to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all as the words inscribed on the walls of these national archives read this building holds and trusts the records of our national life and symbolizes our faith in the permanency of our national institutions the declaration of independence and the constitution are the greatest charters of freedom the world has ever known  the character of our people and the principles enshrined there are the reason for our nation's unparalleled success and they remain the greatest bulwark against tyranny in history the reason is simple our founders knew history sadly we live in a time when too many are forgetting history today thomas jefferson warned that quote if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be but sadly we live in a time when some seek to erase our history and deny our nation's relentless march toward a more perfect union as president trump has observed in too many of our schools and universities millions of young people are educated by those who seek to wipe out our history defame our heroes erase our values and indoctrinate our children but we gather here today soon to hear from the president of the united states as americans who are committed to affirming the greatness of this nation and the ideals of our founders our president understands what we all understand if we don't teach the next generation the principles enshrined in these halls we can't expect them to preserve them no one can preserve what they do not love and no one can love what they do not know why on this constitution day our president will reaffirm our commitment to the principles and liberties that this administration has championed from day one and take measurable steps to ensure that future generations will continue to understand the historical and philosophical roots of our nation what we do here today is a part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that the rising generation will be able to do their part as we know they will to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states and this we know they will do because these principles are not just enshrined in these national archives they're enshrined in the hearts of the american people and i know these great principles will prevail because like our president i have faith in the american people and i have faith that he who guided our founders on this day 233 years ago guides us still for as the father of our constitution james madison reflected on this day and i quote it is impossible not to perceive in it a finger of that almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally extended to our relief at critical stages of the revolution so it's constitution day in america and with gratitude to all of those who have gone before gratitude to all of you who are gathered here who love and cherish our heritage of freedom with gratitude to god who has ever guided the destiny of this land and gratitude to a president who has ever championed the freedoms and ideals enshrined in this place it is now my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the 45th president of the united states of america president donald trump  thank you very much thank you mike great vice president i'm truly honored to be here at the very first white house conference on american history so important our mission is to defend the legacy of america's founding the virtue of america's heroes and the nobility of the american character we must clear away the twisted web of lies in our schools and classrooms and teach our children the magnificent truth about our country we want our sons and daughters to know that they are the citizens of the most exceptional nation in the history of the world to grow up in america is to live in a land where anything is possible where anyone can rise and where any dream can come true all because of the immortal principles of our nation's founders inscribed nearly two and a half centuries ago that's why we've come to the national archives the sacred home of our national memory in this great chamber we preserve our glorious inheritance the declaration of independence the constitution the bill of rights on this very day in 1787 our founding fathers signed the constitution at independence hall in philadelphia it was the fulfillment of a thousand years of western civilization our constitution was the product of centuries of tradition wisdom and experience no political document has done more to advance the human condition or propel the engine of progress yet as we gather this afternoon a radical movement is attempting to demolish this treasured and precious inheritance we can't let that happen left-wing mobs have torn down statues of our founders desecrated our memorials and carried out a campaign of violence and anarchy far left demonstrators have chanted the words america was never great the left has launched a vicious and violent assault on law enforcement the universal symbol of the rule of law in america these radicals have been aided and abetted by liberal politicians establishment media and even large corporations whether it is the mob on the street or the canceled culture in the boardroom the goal is the same to silence dissent to scare you out of speaking the truth and to bully americans into abandoning their values their heritage and their very way of life we are here today to declare that we will never submit to tyranny we will reclaim our history and our country for citizens of every race color religion and crete the radicals burning american flags want to burn down the principles enshrined in our founding documents including the bedrock principle of equal justice under law in order to radically transform america they must first cause americans to lose confidence in who we are where we came from and what we believe as i said at mount rushmore which they would love to rip down and rip it down fast that's never going to happen two months ago the left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the american revolution as many of you testified today the left-wing rioting in mayhem are the direct result of decades of left-wing indoctrination in our schools it's gone on far too long our children are instructed from propaganda tracks like those of howard zinn that try to make students ashamed of their own history the left has warped distorted and defiled the american story with deceptions falsehoods and lies there is no better example than the new york times totally discredited 1619 project this project rewrites american history to teach our children that we were founded on the principle of oppression not freedom nothing could be further from the truth america's founding set in motion the unstoppable chain of events that abolish slavery secured civil rights defeated communism and fascism and built the most fair equal and prosperous nation in human history  the narratives about america being pushed by the far left and being chanted in the streets bear a striking resemblance to the anti-american propaganda of our adversaries because both groups want to see america weakened derided and totally diminished students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory this is a marxist doctrine holding that america is a wicked and racist nation that even young children are complicit in oppression and that our entire society must be radically transformed critical race theory is being forced into our children's schools it's being imposed into workplace trainings and it's being deployed to rip apart friends neighbors and families a perfect example of critical race theory was recently published by the smithsonian institution this document alleged that concepts such as hard work rational thinking and the nuclear family and belief in god were not values that unite all americans but were instead aspects of whiteness this is offensive and outrageous to americans of every ethnicity and it's especially harmful to children of minority backgrounds who should be uplifted not disparaged teaching this horrible doctrine to our children is a form of child abuse in the truest sense of those words for many years now the radicals have mistaken americans silence for weakness but they're wrong there is no more powerful force than a parent's love for their children and patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country american parents are not going to accept indoctrination in our schools cancel culture in our work or the repression of traditional faith culture and values in the public square not anymore  thank you thank you very much we embrace the vision of martin luther king where children are not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character the left is attempting to destroy that beautiful vision and divide americans by race in the service of political power by viewing every issue through the lens of race they want to impose a new segregation and we must not allow that to happen critical race theory the 1619 project and the crusade against american history is toxic propaganda ideological poison that if not removed will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together will destroy our country that is why i recently banned trainings in this prejudiced ideology from the federal government and banned it in the strongest manner possible the only path to national unity is through our shared identity as americans that is why it is so urgent that we finally restore patriotic education to our schools under our leadership the national endowment for the humanities has awarded a grant to support the development of a pro-american curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation's great history we are joined by some of the respected scholars involved in this project including professor wilford mcclay wilford please thank you very much thank you dr peter wood of the national association of scholars dr peter thank you thank you and ted rebarber thank you ted thank you very much today i'm also pleased to announce that i will soon sign an executive order establishing a national commission to promote patriotic education it will be called the 1776 commission  thank you it will encourage our educators to teach our children about the miracle of american history and make plans to honor the 250th anniversary of our founding think of that 250 years recently i also signed an executive order to establish the national garden of american heroes a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest americans who have ever lived today i'm announcing a new name for inclusion one of the 56 signers of the declaration of independence was a patriot from delaware in july of 1776 the continental congress was deadlocked during the debate over independence the delegation from delaware was divided caesar rodney was called upon to break the tie even though he was suffering from very advanced cancer he was deathly ill rodney rode 80 miles through the night through a severe thunderstorm from dover to philadelphia to cast his vote for independence for nearly a century a statue of one of delaware's most beloved citizen stood in rodney square right in the heart of wilmington but this past june cesar rodney statue was ordered removed by the mayor and local politicians as part of a radical purge of america's founding generation today because of an order i signed if you demolish a statue without permission you immediately get 10 years in prison and there have been no statues demolished for the last four months incredibly since the time i signed that act joe biden said nothing as to his home state's history and the fact that it was dismantled and dismembered in a founding father's statue was removed today america will give this founding father this very brave man who was so horribly treated the place of honor he deserves i'm announcing that the statue of caesar rodney will be added to the national garden of american heroes from washington to lincoln from jefferson to king america has been home to some of the most incredible people who have ever lived the help of everyone here today the legacy of 1776 will never be erased our heroes will never be forgotten our youth will be taught to love america with all of their heart and all of their soul we will save this cherished inheritance for our children for their children and for every generation to come this is a very important day thank you all once again for being here now i will sign the constitution day proclamation god bless you and god bless america thank you very much  so  you
thank you very much everyone so a lot of work has been going on with respect to the vaccines very successful work i might add we have three great great companies doing somewhat different variations but they're all looking very good from the beginning of the china virus all nations have understood that our top priority must be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible to end the pandemic and get life back to normal the successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives it will put an end to the restrictions and some of the things that go on and have to go on in the meantime today i want to discuss the historic progress we're making to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time and there's never been anything like this ever in our history there's never been an in history period world history since january america's brilliant doctors and scientists have been working around the clock these are the best medical minds in the world by far and the vaccines are going through the gold standard of clinical trials and very heavy emphasis placed on safety three vaccines are already in the final stage joe biden's anti-vaccine theories are putting a lot of lives at risk and they're only doing it for political reasons it's very foolish it's part of their war to try and discredit the vaccine now that they know that we essentially have it we'll be announcing it fairly soon as part of operation warp speed my administration is manufacturing all of the most promising vaccines in advance and actually it'll be fairly long in advance as soon as a vaccine is approved the administration will deliver it to the american people immediately distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice and the general i think those are the words specifically you wanted us to use within 24 hours you're all set to go and massive amounts will be delivered through our great military and the general is one of our best and he is ready to go we'll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and likely much more than that hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month and we expect to have enough vaccines for every american by april and uh again i'll say that even at that later stage the delivery will go as fast as it comes they can deliver they're very good best probably the best in the world the estimates i'm providing today are based on the manufacturing that's impressed we've already exceeded our ambitious goals under the defense production act contracts that we've secured we may even get far above these numbers and numbers that i'm telling you today i think will exceed them very very substantially and i think that also includes distribution i think distribution will go even quicker than most people think i'm relying on our military everything i've done with our military has worked out very well in a short time we'll have a safe and effective vaccine and will defeat the virus interestingly as i was saying that go very well just like uh what we did with our military with respect to isis went very well long ahead of schedule they have been incredible in working with me let's go to puerto rico because puerto rico's been hit very very hard by a lot of different storms and they're great people it's a great place i know it well great place today my administration is making the largest emergency relief award in history to rebuild puerto rico's electrical grid and educational system reporting billions distribution years ago this was beyond even the storms it was just age and a lot of the salt the salt from that ocean is a killer for electrical stations and power generation systems but on top of the salt you had these massive storms or hurricanes come in and maria in particular was a disaster but for many years they've been trying to get this done and have been had the political will power in washington to get it done so we're going to get it done for them we're also going to be bringing back very very major amounts of medical work you know we used to have pharmaceutic pharmaceutical manufacturing at levels that few places had and a lot of it's left puerto rico and we're going to bring that back especially now since our emphasis is going to be making our product so we're going to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to puerto rico a lot of it left over the years over a long period of time it's been leaving and going to china and other places so we're bringing all of that back this was done in previous administrations i'd like to just point out we've done more for puerto rico than anybody and this is just an example of it but we've done more for puerto rico by far than anybody we'll also be launching a major effort to repair and renovate the schools across the island following hurricane maria my administration immediately deployed the full power of the federal government to bring the electric grid back online so they could at least temporarily and it certainly wasn't a permanent fix it was ripped to shreds but a lot of that was ripped to shreds long before even the storm came in for many many years they've been trying to do it but we wanted to restore water supplies is medical distribution manufacturing for many years i think that's going to be very exciting for the people and we're undertaking the largest federal investment in puerto rico's history so you have a lot of i have a lot of friends in puerto rico and i've told them about it ask them about it conceptually what do you think and they're very excited i just want to say by contrast biden's devastated the island of puerto rico he joe biden what he's done to puerto rico meaning the past administration is is devastating a player in global pharmaceutical manufacturing that's what happened when biden voted to repeal this provision the pharmaceutical industry was ripped out of puerto rico all incentive to stay there was taken away and all of the jobs went to china and other places but mostly to china that's what happened this was done with a vote of biden this was even before the obama administration it was this was early on but so so sad that that was done and then obama came in and it got worse so for the people of puerto rico they were a disaster for you and i have to say in a very nice way a very respectful way i'm the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico nobody even close but as a result the island's economy under the previously mentioned names it just absolutely cratered biden's vote also left the united states at the mercy of foreign suppliers for essential medicines putting our national security and our health at risk we had a tremendous industry and our health at risk we had a tremendous industry potentially going to puerto rico and they just absolutely cut it short with bad votes and took all the incentive away and it went to other places far away lance so they really in a sense were voting to destroy puerto rico and we're bringing puerto rico back and we'll have it done fairly quickly and the 13 billion dollars is uh that's a tremendous that's a tremendous amount of money but it's a very important amount and i think you're going to see something terrific and it's very exciting to me what the most exciting is bringing the whole pharmaceutical industry back we've spoken to various companies and they're willing to go there they want to have a little bit of help but they're willing to go to puerto rico and puerto rico is going to be very exciting what's going to happen they were on the verge of doing it and they took away all the incentives i don't know how that was allowed to happen but they allowed it to happen that was very very bad for puerto rico and the people of puerto rico that was done by democrats and a republican is bringing it back so with that we can take a few questions and we are again very advanced on the vaccine we think that sometime in the very near future we'll have it where i would say i think i can say years ahead of schedule what it would be if it were an administration other than this one it would have been you would have been years before you ever had anything approved by the fda john please mr president this huge aid package to puerto rico why not a year ago why not two years ago why not three years ago why forty six days to the day because what we're doing is we've been working on it for a long time to get it passed very tough to get things past democrats where they don't want to see this happen and they probably certainly didn't want to see it happen at this point but it's a big package it's a great package and i think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry we're going to get them back into puerto rico they liked being there but they changed the tax situation they ripped it out so they really ripped apart the island and we're going to bring it back john it may be simply coincidental but it does coincide with the big push for puerto rican voters that the biden harris campaign yeah i think that's well they can't do anything look the biden harris campaign what they did they heard you know i've gone through it and whether it was president obama or vice president biden they were a disaster for puerto rico a disaster and what we're doing and what we've done but what we're doing is something that will be fantastic for many years in the future bringing back the pharma pharmaceutical industry manufacturing in puerto rico is what they've wanted for years and we're doing that in addition to the 13 billion dollars yes please mr president i think i heard you write saying that you said that there should you expect to have enough vaccines for every american by april so as we sit here in mid-september and there have been questions about the timeline can you walk us through now and the beginning of april to which every american can have a vaccination i think we may exceed those numbers even scott do you want to discuss that quickly sure as has been said many times okay and we have all the people that are involved in the actual vaccine distribution here but uh we were just going through this as of the end of the year we will have over a hundred million doses manufactured the people who are not prioritized list of including high risk including first responders will have the ability to take the vaccine no one's being mandated to be vaccinated at at the latest in january and as we said uh yesterday and or i think yesterday the there will be hundreds of millions of doses delivered for people to take it during the first quarter and so that by april every single american who wants to be vaccinated will have the ability to be vaccinated it's not a forced vaccination of course dr falchi said today basically echoed dr redfield's comments that q2 q3 some point the summer of next year the entire country potentially or at least as many americans that need to be vaccinated will be vaccinated is that the timeline next summer that's on the outer edge we think we can beat that number very substantially if you don't if you don't mind um the commerce department essentially gave you a runway today to strike a deal after the election do you expect a tick-tock deal before the election or after the election i think it could go quickly we have uh great companies talking to us about it you know about oracle you know microsoft has been involved and let's see whether or not they're continuing to be involved walmart is truly a great company they are very much involved they want to do something so we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy but have the security that we need we have to have the total security from china we're just no we're not going to do anything to jeopardize security at the same time it's it's an amazing company very very popular so that we can do a combination of both i'd be very happy doing that could go very quickly that could go very very fast yeah please mr president go ahead chris thank you mr president um on kuwait so the ambassador to the kuwaiti ambassador to austria this week told the iaea that the kuwaiti government is very concerned over iran's constant breaching of the jcpoa in your discussions with the kuwaitis today have you discussed where they stand this week as we go into the u.n as the united states tries to extend sanctions on iran well they just left my office as you know the oval office and we had a very good meeting with the emir and i think we understand each other very well they're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the middle east they they are so excited that we signed the first two countries and i think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it i have i would say seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working uh very easily very quickly nobody thought this would happen and not only is it happening it's happening rather easily we discuss that very briefly because that's that's an easy one believe it or not that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely uh but we are uh talking to them and others about various aspects of the middle east the middle east is straightening out with all that's happening you know we've brought a lot of our troops back a lot of them are coming back in the very near future we're out of syria other than we kept the oil i kept the oil and we have troops guarding the oil other than that we're out of syria we took them off the border between syria and turkey we had a lot of troops on the border ultimately we got it down to 50 and i thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight and you have 50 people in the middle i don't care who you are even if the you're the u.s those 50 people are in great danger we took them out but we had a lot of troops on the border and we took them out i said look they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that under different names and they can continue to do that that's not for us we're guarding our own borders we're doing very well on our southern border as an example so we're out of syria except we kept the oil and we'll make a determination we'll probably be dealing with the kurds on the oil and see what it all ends up but we'll be out and uh very importantly uh we're down to very few soldiers in iraq and uh we're down we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4 000 less than 4 000 in afghanistan and then we'll make that final determination a little bit later and we're dealing very well with the taliban they're very tough they're very smart they're very sharp but you know it's been 19 years and even they are tired of fighting in all fairness and we really served as a police force because if we wanted to do what we had to do we would have fought a lot differently than they have over their 19 years they didn't fight it properly they were they were police okay they're not police they're they're soldiers so there's a difference the police nobody has more respect for police than i do but they have to do their own policing so we're having some very good discussions with the taliban as you probably heard it's been public and but we'll be down to very shortly we'll be down to less than 4 000 soldiers and so we'll be out of there knowing that certain things have to happen certain things have to be fulfilled but 19 years is a long time 8 000 miles away 19 years is a long time and the middle east the whole middle east equation if you look at what's happened if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made including the deal that was made i mean take a look at what happened with iran had that deal stayed i had not broken that deal you could have never done the deal that i'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in and i had two calls this morning with countries that want to know when can we go into the deal they want to go it's not that we're giving anything they want security they want peace and they're really tired of fighting it's incredible they're tired of fighting they've been fighting for so many years they're tired of fighting thank you very much mr president mr president a question on the vaccine but first uh on puerto rico i i heard you many times over the past couple of years saying that puerto rico got too much money i mean just last year you said uh puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth we'll talk about how congress they have money you said never again you said congress gave too much money to puerto rico why now we're building that up as a great medical pharmaceutical manufacturing area where you know we're going to be taking back a lot of the business that we let go for years and we'll bring we're going to bring it back they were very good at it they did a fantastic job but they destroyed it with their tax policy they made it impossible for people to stay so people went to china mostly into other countries puerto rico has been very corrupt in terms of its politicians you see that they're one after another it's been unbelievably corrupt and we're studying that and working on that and we think we have a good group of people who are working very well with the politicians right now but i think more exciting than the then the dollars and you have to do something with respect to their grid their grid is a disaster their generators are wiped out and they've been wiped out for years long before maria came they've been wiped out for years so if we can build puerto rico back into a pharmaceutical manufacturing area we're going to designate it as such i think it'll be unbelievable for puerto rico unbelievable for the people of puerto rico and we can make it very successful in a larger question on the vaccine and on on other issues regarding the experts in your government uh last night you uh you criticized what christopher wray told congress your fbi director you obviously said that the cdc director was flat wrong on a couple of things this week how is it that uh you don't trust your own experts do you do do you think you know better no i think i think i have yeah in many cases i do uh i think we have a bigger problem with china than we have with russia i think china is a far bigger problem and i said well that's okay if you want to think about russia but what about china uh i think that's appropriate i thought that the definition of antifa was an absolutely incorrect definition so i speak up i like to speak up i have fantastic people that's why we're able to make these great trade deals that's why we're able to do things like we're doing today that's why the country has done so well the country's done numbers like nobody had we not had the china plague come in if the if that virus didn't come in the plague i call it the plague from china didn't come in the numbers we had were were not only record records they were beyond anything anyone's ever seen in any country frankly now we closed it up and now we're opening it up and by the way the democrats ought to open up their states and they go to open them up fast john the faster the better because they're hurting their people a lot of damage done with these extended shutdowns but we saved millions of lives by doing it the way we did it and now we're opening it up and you see the kind of numbers the manufacturing numbers see the retail numbers you look at the employment numbers they're setting records it's an incredible thing that's happening had the plague nut come in we would have been right now at a level that nobody's ever seen before nobody's ever seen but even before it was at the highest stock market best unemployment numbers and employment numbers were up to 160 million people just short of 160 million people employed we were never close to a number like that and now we're doing it again and next year we will have a great economic year i think one of our best the postal service had planned on sending 650 million face masks to americans back in april that never happened uh why not and was it because i don't know i don't run it to be honest let's run as you know that's run by a commission and they run it i think frankly if they would raise the price of packaging you'd end up making a lot of money or breaking even or doing something the post office has been a mess for many many generations but for certainly decades and it loses a lot of money it's always lost a lot of money and one of the reasons it loses a lot of money now is that it's delivering all these packages and every time they deliver a package they lose three dollars a package or whatever the number may be so i would suggest that they raise the price of packages and you might get something where it loses very little or maybe broke even or maybe even made some money would can you imagine a thing like that and whether it's amazon or any of the other internet delivery services if you did that you'd have a whole different post office so hopefully they'll be doing that in the meantime i know so many people in the postal system and i've known them over the years they're incredible people and they're very secure they're going to be very secure you know the problem they have with the ballots not the post office the problem they have with the ballots is the people sending the ballots and the people counting the ballots and who are they sending them to where are they being sent are they being sent to the wrong areas are they not being sent at all there'll be tremendous corruption if they don't do something about it now one big hope is that we're in front of numerous federal judges in nevada we're in front in pennsylvania as you know we're in front in uh michigan we have numerous court cases out there that are very well advanced and you'll start seeing decisions just like we won the case on opening up pennsylvania that was a great decision by a judge that came down two days ago and that was a very important decision so but we have a lot of very important decisions coming down on this on the scam of unsolicited ballots where they're sending out tens of millions of ballots to everybody people that didn't expect them people are getting inundated with they'll be showered with ballots everybody in this room knows it's a scam okay everybody in this room even john don't say it john because it's a scam sending ballots sending ballots at a level they are never going to be able to count them let me ask you people in the white house when you solicit when you go out it's called absentee or solicit when you go out and you request a ballot you want to say i want to vote because i can't be in florida or i can't be someplace your request so you're sending something in it's handled professionally they send it back it's a whole thing that's much different than unsolicited when you get millions of ballots i heard numbers like 80 million ballots now just this week they had another one another one of the disasters that took place an election but look at what happened in new jersey and they had another one in new jersey very very bad different than patterson look at what happened in new york with carolyn uh your congressman murphy maloney carolyn maloney look at that i mean look at that race carolyn maloney had a race it was a disaster ballots are missing ballots are fraught these are small races easy to look at what happened in virginia look at what happened at various other parts of the country even over the last short period of war and these aren't 80 million or 50 million or 20 million votes these are small elections these are congressional elections where in theory it's easy so what's going to happen on november 3rd when somebody's leading and they said well we haven't counted the ballots we have millions of ballots to count it's a disaster everyone knows it everyone knows it's a disaster and i don't expect people here to say although some people will some people would say it everyone knows you don't even have to know politics to know and this has nothing to do with post office by the way where are these ballots going who's sending them who's signing them you have in nevada you have a governor that signs something where he doesn't want verification of the signature so what does that mean so he doesn't even want verification of the signature so i think it's going to be a terrible time for this country and we're counting on federal judges to do a great constitutional job when they are they're right now analyzing it many many federal judges when they like i think five or six but many federal judges i can tell you in pennsylvania big in nevada very big i believe it's in front of a judge in michigan we have a lot of judges have not yet ruled on this but uh if it's ruled in a different manner or it's ruled where uh these millions and millions of unsolicited people that aren't even asking there's such a difference you write in you ask they send it to you you sign it you send it back that's perfect that's absentee there's nothing like going to the voter booth by the way nothing where they check you as you go in there's nothing like that but that's absentee that's okay but the scam of sending millions and millions of bills and you know who knows this better than i do the democrats they know it's going to be a mess they know it's going to they're going to be millions of missing ballots or tremendous numbers of missing ballots you could be talking about large percentages of these ballots are going to be missing there's going to be fraud it's a disaster and everybody and it'll be a lot easier for me not to bring it up but everybody knows i'm right and you don't have to know a lot about elections you don't have to know a lot about politics this is going to be the scam of all time and hopefully the federal judges all respected all highly respected hopefully they'll be able to see this clearly and stop it okay thank you very much everybody so i want to congratulate puerto rico and i think you're going to have a great period of time i think you're going to see a rebuilding of puerto rico thank you very much
uh all right thank you oh you're gonna get a warning right no warning so oh sure requests yes sir so all right no updates is um um frank good evening to you we're expecting the president in the next few minutes here we are expecting him to comment on the charges of the brianna taylor case and the violence that we're seeing gripping the streets of louisville the president was asked about it earlier today in the cabinet room but hadn't been briefed up enough on it to feel comfortable commenting on it the president also expected to be asked this evening about his looming pick for the supreme court earlier today the president pointing to his favorite boogeyman mail in voting is a reason to quickly return the supreme court to its full strength and president trump trump might get some more love from hispanics if he were to nominate barbara lagoa from the 11th circuit court of appeals to fill the seat vacated by ruth bader ginsburg with only a year's worth of experience on the federal bench there are concerns among some people that legoa's judicial record is a little thin so for the moment brett tonight jamie coney barrett remains the front runner okay uh um um okay yeah two minute warning is i tell you what sorry hello thank you very much thank you today johnson and johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials this is record time this is the fourth vaccine candidate in the united states to reach the final stage of trial so we have four candidates already at a very late date late being a very positive word in this case earlier this year johnson and johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by september but due to our support under operation warp speed and to some of the incredible scientists involved they've reached phase three trials by september far ahead of schedule we encourage americans to enroll in the vaccine trial it's not only interesting it'll be a terrific thing for our country we encourage everybody to enroll as many people as we can today my administration announced that we are awarding 200 million dollars of cares act funding to all 50 states to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents and we want to do that the instant it is approved not the following day but the following moment and so we're going to be doing that and we'll be distributing getting it ready because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out through operation warp speed we also continue to accelerate life-saving therapies we are seeing promising results that are monoclonal antibody treatments which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly refining can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70 percent by cutting red tape and unleashing america's medical genius we've reduced the fatality rate 85 percent since april for individuals under 50 they've they have a 99.98 rate of survival from the china virus that's a number that's been in really increasing substantially with time as children go back to school we're encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread brown university conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 states and found that only .076 percent of students had confirmed cases of the virus that's a tiny percentage and only .15 of teachers had confirmed cases patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6 percent of all emergency room visits the lowest since the pandemic began 1.6 percent emergency room visits as far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned we provided over 21 billion dollars to our nursing homes and we are really focused on the nursing homes everybody and including our governors we have governors are working very closely with the task force and with the vice president and everybody involved we've sent rapid testing devices to nearly fourteen thousand certified nursing homes in the country this week we're sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure they can test staff regularly and the staff now is being tested on a very very powerful and uh on a regular basis but uh very strongly at the finest level the highest level on the best tests we're encouraged that the number of americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50 compared to last year substantially up uh the flu when it's mixed with covid or china virus is uh going to be very interesting to see what happens but that can drive numbers and we just don't know what that will be yet but you'll have flu numbers and you'll have some covet numbers i think we're rounding the turn very much you see what's happening in europe however they have a very big spike countries that we thought were doing well aren't doing well they had some very big spikes very a very big surge months ago we increased our nation's procurement of the flu vaccine by 66 percent and we ask americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible uh it's possible i would imagine scott that the flu can get mixed up with the virus and people can think it's the virus when actually it's another flu season coming on i don't know it's uh i hope they can keep them separate can they keep them separate i hope so i definitely will it's going to be a very interesting time but we have a flu season coming up we've had some flu seasons which are really massive over the years over many years and we have some that are much less so but it's still significant so i hope they can separate them because it's it's pretty close in the past four months we've created 10.6 million jobs we cut unemployment rate nearly in half the unemployment rate is cut nearly in half larry kudlow is here he'll be discussing that in a little while retail sales are up 121 percent that's far above what we thought manufacturing is up 61 that's above also above our schedule and our schedule is a heavy schedule automobile production is up six-fold homebuilders sentiment is at the highest level in history that's an amazing statement larry the highest level in history that means people are thinking good thoughts home sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years small business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration substantially higher small business optimism higher than at any time over the last more than the last administration today i was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first ever pledge to america's workers presidential award this award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living great people over 5 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the american worker and it's really been amazing we've created the fastest economic recovery in american history you are witnessing it you're part of it our approach is pro-science biden's approach is anti-science if you look it's i don't think they know what their approach is although a lot of us copied from what we've done biden opposed the china travel ban and the europe travel ban and the strategy that they have is just never ending lockdowns we're not locking down we're actually growing at a rate that we've never experienced before but they're talking about if you have a question just lock it down we're not doing that and you can't do that our plan will crush the virus and actually uh biden's plan will crush america if you think about it you can't lock down again we're growing at levels that nobody's ever seen before our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery our opponent's plan would hurt america very badly send us into a depression and with all of that being said we are going to be having a very exciting saturday at five o'clock in the rose garden where i'll be putting forth my nominee for supreme court justice and i think it will be a a great nominee a brilliant nominee as you know it's a woman we've brought it down to five women it's time for a woman to uh to be chosen with everything that's happened and with justice ginsburg's passing we are uh going to go sometime tomorrow morning as i understand it to pay our respects and we'll be over there and i guess they probably put that announcement down but that will be done tomorrow morning the vice president was there today and so if you have any questions we'll take a few questions right here mr president uh real quickly when loser draw in this election will you commit here today for a peaceful trans referral of power after the election and there has been rioting in louisville there's been rioting in many cities across this country red and your so-called red and blue states will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power after the election well we're gonna have to see what happens you know that i've been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster and but people are rioting do you commit to making sure that there's a peaceful transfer we want to have get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very trans we'll have a very peaceful there won't be a transfer frankly there'll be a continuation the ballots are out of control you know it and you know who knows it better than anybody else the democrats know it better than anybody else go ahead the second question is will you please go ahead why won't you you ask me a question do you go after the russians say it mr president do you plan to meet with barbara lagoa at the white house do you you i cannot hear you with three yes i'm sorry uh do you plan to meet with barbara lego in washington and is she still on your shortlist she is on my list i don't have a meeting planned but she is on my list uh do you have i don't really talk about the meetings planned i i speak to people i talk to people but i don't have a meeting planned now do you have a response to the governor of missouri testing positive for coronavirus i didn't know that no yeah mr president um we asked you earlier today about uh the brianna taylor case yes could you comment now i assume you've been briefed on the charges in the book well i thought it was uh really brilliant kentucky attorney general daniel cameron is doing a fantastic job i think he's a star and he made a statement that i'll just read justice not justice is not often easy it does not fit the mold of public opinion and it does not conform to shifting standards it answers only to the facts and to the law if we simply act on emotion or outrage there's no justice mob justice is not justice justice sort by violence is not justice it just becomes revenge i mean i i heard that i said write that down for me please because i think it's it was a terrific statement he's handling it very well you know who he is right you i think you know i think everyone now knows who he is i will be speaking to the governor and we have a call scheduled to make very shortly with the governor i understand he's called up the national guard which is a good thing i think it's a very positive thing and it'll all work out can i just follow on your supreme court nominee um it's highly unlikely that any democrats will vote for your nominee if it when it comes to a vote in the senate i think that's a pretty safe assumption but on that point would you want to nominate someone who in their confirmation to the appellate court received broad bipartisan support or would you be more inclined to put forward somebody whose confirmation fell along party lines i can't tell you what's going to happen with the democrats i can say this the person that i will be putting up and i won't say that i've even chosen that person yet i could say any one of the five they're outstanding women but the person i'll be putting up is highly qualified totally brilliant top of the line academic student the highest credentials all of them have that but the highest credentials and you'll see on saturday who that is i can't imagine why a democrat wouldn't vote for this person yeah please go ahead thank you very much no not you you're right here thank you mr president uh prince harry and meghan markle uh chimed in on the us election and essentially encouraged people to vote for joe biden let me get your reaction to that i'm not a fan of hers and uh i would say this and she probably has heard that but i wish a lot of luck to harry because he's going to need it mr president the fda is reportedly considering stricter guidelines for the emergency authorization of a coveted vaccine are you okay with that well i'd say what we're looking at that that has to be approved by the white house we may or may not approve it that sounds like a political move because when you have pfizer johnson and johnson modern are these great companies coming up with these the vaccines and they've done testing and everything else i'm saying why would they have to be you know adding great length to the process we want to have people not get sick the vaccine is very important it's the final step i believe it's going to be the final step and no we're looking at that but i think it's a i think that was a political move more than anything else on that sir it's designed to improve trust in the vaccine do you think that's not needed well i have tremendous trust in these massive companies that are so brilliantly organized in terms of what they've been doing with the tests i mean i don't know that a government as big as we are could do tests like this we've made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion but when they come back and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works and they're coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with i don't see any reason why it should be delayed further because if they delete delay in a week or two weeks or three weeks you know that's a lot of lives you're talking about scott would you agree with that or how do you feel about that yeah thanks um yeah i mean there is no i think that people don't understand what's going on with operation warp speed it's unprecedented what's happened here a typical vaccine takes roughly four years or so and now we're going to have a vaccine highly likely in in far less than one year but without cutting any safety corners because the president has done things concomitant to the development of the vaccine that is the manufacturing the logistics everything is being done at the same time and that's never been done before but there is zero cutting of safety concerns there is there should be no uh hesitation about the safety you shouldn't be punished by doing something faster than other people could have done or thought it's the opposite we have a pandemic the urgency is the pandemic not politics are you sounding extremely political why would they do this when we come back with these great results and i think you will have those questions why would we why would we be delaying it but we're going to look at it we're going to take a look at it and ultimately the white house has to approve it and maybe we will and maybe we won't but we'll be taking a look i have to leave for an emergency phone call i'm going to let scott and larry finish it larry's going to talk about it so i'll be uh i'll be back i will see you tomorrow a big day just one more question on brianna taylor we're in a time right now where americans feel like we are on people are protesting in the streets what is your message to them people feel like we are on this carousel where another black lives matter so here we have dr scott atlas and larry kudlow um i encourage you all to be respectful and show a little bit of decorum here as they take your questions yes can you uh clarify for us uh your views on the impact of the virus spreading in the communities reporting that maybe you favor or have talked about or looked at some sort of heard immunity strategy you said to fox in july that when younger healthier people get the disease they don't have a problem with the disease low risk troops getting the infection is not a problem in fact it's a positive can you say what you meant by that is does that indicate that oh sure spreading sort of among younger folks who are less susceptible i think i've answered this multiple times but i have never advocated a herd immunity strategy there's never been a desire to have cases spread through the community that's a false story i've denied that multiple times and i just don't that false story doesn't seem to die but that's the fact and the description of immunity coming when people get an infection is not something i'm inventing that but that has never been a policy that i have advocated there has never been a policy uh recommendation to pursue that to the president and that is not the president's policy 60 000 cases yesterday do you have any sense or does the task force have any sense of what is driving that that's the highest level in six weeks why are we still seeing cases at this level yeah well i mean there are several things to look at but the case metric is not the most important metric the most important metric are the following hospitalizations per day are coming down deaths per day are coming down number of people in the hospital is 47 percent lower than it was since its peak the number of people sick with coveted illness coming to the emergency room is 1.6 percent as the president said the lowest number since the pandemic began all of these trends are positive the cases per se are defined by tests if i tested a million people i would see more cases the only thing that counts are the the the problems with the cases so when we see that hospitalizations per day are coming down people are not dying as much these are all very positive trends and that's exactly what we want to see go ahead dr dr atlas is there any bad blood between you and dr deborah burks no i saw the story in uh really a super journalism story uh dr burks speaks for herself but that that's a completely false story and she denied it today it's completely false when do you expect a vaccine yeah so this is a very important uh question the the vaccine is proceeding at an extremely rapid pace as we know everything's being done simultaneously so that the logistics and the uh technology in place to deliver it is ready to go as everyone knows and it depends on the data okay the the data is being monitored by an external group of experts called the data data safety monitoring board and when we have enough cases that when they see enough cases that have shown a statistically significant difference they will tell the company and then the company will say look at it and say yes we have it and we think that that has a good chance of happening in october it's kind of just that i follow you did say that last week in this room pretty much the same thing but you said it could be the truth yeah i understand but i want to clear it up because you said it could be as late as january it could be after the election that there's no clear-cut time and that's what i want to make sure that that you're saying this is the current thinking that i have been told i'm not in charge of the vaccine development i'm relaying information and what i've been told is exactly what i said and there will be a hundred million plus doses available by the end of this year it is highly likely we will have a vaccine before the end of the year and it is also likely that we will say the data is good we have the vaccine and then it will be submitted of course for approval and authorization sometime in october but it depends on the on the data no one can really say with certainty when it's coming that's just impossible i don't see the data until the data happens dr redfield today said that more than 90 of the population remains susceptible to coronavirus do you agree with that assessment yeah i think that dr reckfield uh misstated something there and the reason last time i'm gonna answer your question let me finish uh the the data on susceptible that he was talking about was his uh surveillance data that showed that roughly nine percent of the country has antibodies but when you look at the cdc data state by state much of that data is old some of it goes back to march or april before many of these states have the cases that's point number one point number two is that the immunity to the infection is not solely determined by the percent of people who have antibodies if you look at the research and there's been about 24 papers at least on the immunity from t cells this is different type of immunity than antibodies and without being boring the reality is that according to the papers from sweden singapore and elsewhere there is cross immunity highly likely from other infections and there is also t cell immunity and the combination of those makes the antibodies a small fraction of the people that have immunity so the answer is no it is not 90 of people that are susceptible to the infection so i guess my question is for i'm not a doctor i defer to your expertise on this end to his but so americans hear one thing from the cdc director and another thing from you who are we to to believe you're supposed to believe the science and i'm telling you the science so he's not telling us i'm telling you the science and that's the answer and if you want to look up all the data you're free to you can also talk to the following epidemiologist why is he still going out before congress and speaking if you say he's mistaken today and the president said he mistaked it last time americans are looking for the best information right now yeah and i'm giving you the best information and it's confirmed by people like martin koldorf who's a harvard epidemiologist at harvard medical school let me finish please jay bhattacharya and johnny anitis both epidemiologists at stanford professor gupta university of oxford these are people who know the latest data on the immunology and what's happening and i just recited it to you i'm gonna give scott a little time off i'm just to give scott a little time off i want to reinforce some of the things that president trump said about the economy because that's very much a key part of the story we got some new numbers out late last week and this week and i wanted to underscore that if we can get the charts back up i want to show you some more examples of the d-shaped recovery i actually i i can jump in here this is from the census bureau report a change in the number of people living in poverty during president trump's first three years pre-pandemic 6.6 million fewer people 6.6 million fewer people were living in poverty what's the number of postponements and the um what's the number postpendant well we'll have to wait and see on that just nothing more let me go to the uh under the obama uh years 787 000 people uh moved into poverty so that's a problem and we have the second chart isn't that an old target yeah no this is a brand new this stuff just came out lately right now if i if i may okay i just like accurate information this is the accurate information this is from the sentence and it just came back well let me just go back into this three years into president trump's uh presidency under his policies real family income is probably the best measure of living standards there is real median household income grew by six thousand over six thousand dollars that is five times the rate of the eight years of the obama administration i hear people ask me legitimate questions i respect that this is some kind of has been a k-shaped recovery where only the wealthy did well and the bottom did not do well in fact this is the middle real family income and i will add to that not only was this five times higher but the biggest gains came in the lower income levels significantly higher than the top one percent uh or the top uh 10 now let me hit another chart put this up uh see where we're sort of doing this by field go ahead more charts there we go back to the v-shaped recovery you've heard me speak about this i just want to underscore we got new production numbers uh this week this is a v-shaped recovery in automobiles a key sector of the economy and we had additional numbers on housing that i'd like to show confirming the v-shaped uh recovery housing housing there we go we're at an all-time high in home builder sentiment all right very important leading indicator a clear v-shape recovery and if anything it's strengthening and finally i think the last chart is on existing home sales here it is their highest reading in 14 years so i just want to say we have more work to do with respect to the um to the recovery and return to economic health we have more work to do there is still hardship and there is still heartbreak you know but the numbers coming in how many americans are living in poverty right now actually that won't be i can only wait until the census bureau i don't know if you cover this beat a number of americans living in poverty right now do you happen to know the answer uh no because we're getting them you don't know i will wait you're an economic advisor right if you'll just stop nitpicking and let me explain these history numbers well you should have a history lesson too it will help you understand but i'm going to say to you these are census bureau numbers the most accurate comprehensive they are not out yet so i'm giving you the ones that were released late last week they're the most up-to-date numbers and under the president's policies of lower taxes and regulations and energy independence and better trade deals we've had a phenomenal increase in living standards five times what the prior administration had for eight years and we're proud of that and this is a topic that will come up again and again second point i want to make is while living standards went up poverty went down and inequality went down so the notion that under president trump only the top end benefit is simply not true these are facts from the census bureau and they are backed up by many other facts that we've talked about as i've discussed with those of you and then finally the v-shape recovery we've got more work to do on unemployment and employment no question about that i think this is a self-sustaining recovery as i've said we would welcome some additional assistance in targeted areas particularly getting back to school and working on covert related safety precautions and health precautions we'd love to see an extension of the small business loans the ppp program but the recovery itself continues to move ahead nicely we're in the right direction and this is no time to change policies yes ma'am go ahead did you comment on a pending stock deal that's going to be taking place in ipo in the hong kong stock exchanges and technology group they could raise as much as 40 billion dollars potentially the largest ipo in history there have been a lot of security national security concerns a lot of human rights concerns about the technology used potentially to suppress the uyghur people what is the administration's position on the ant technology group ipo i'm going to reserve comment on the deal itself but i will add to your question we are examining all these deals and publicly held companies china-based companies that may list on our exchanges we are examining them with respect to transparency possible fraudulent accounting this comes from a financial working group report and we've given them one year to shape up and get their books in order including their backdrop books their supporting papers to prove to the public accounting board and the sec that they are safe for american investors with whole comment on that particularly yes today in california the governor issued an executive order designed to move the state to the point where there will be no gas powered vehicles sold by 2035. what do you make of this move that's taking place in california do you expect it to to spread around the country what are the uh the economic ramifications i don't expect it to spread with respect to governor newsom whom i know it just seems like a very extreme position i don't know how you get there i'll have a look at the proposal if there's more detail meet on the bones i don't see this happening elsewhere i don't think we should be taking any steps to get rid of fossil fuels for example and by the way there should be consumer choice for all automobiles and that includes electric automobiles but i'd have to look at the governor's proposal um it just sounds very extreme to me i don't know how you do it larry do you think that the fight now over the supreme court nominee is going to have a major impact on the possibility to get ppp extended and what impact will that have on the economy if for example aid for airlines does not get extended in october you know it it doesn't have to interfere i mean you can walk and chew gum at the same time they operate on different lanes legislatively so i guess that's my take we would like very much to help the airlines we've told them that you can't run a healthy economy without the airline channel and we'll see what has to be done there with respect to possible legislation or even possibly with respect to executive administrative action we will take a look on that again you've heard me say i don't think this recovery right now is dependent on an additional assistance package but there are a number of targeted areas in that package including airlines most particularly small business loans and getting back to school that i think would be a big help and i just don't see if you can have agreement on four or five or six measures which is what's been happening even though you don't get the whole deal why not do it it'll help americans uh move ahead in terms of the recovery last one do you think that we need another broad stimulus package or do you think i think do we think do you think the us needs another broad stimulus package or do you favor sort of a la carte type measures like on airlines for instance yeah i think i would say to you sensible efficient targeted measures might be very helpful i don't think we need another gigantic multi-trillion dollar package and as i say you know the latest numbers coming in are looking very good the v-shape recovery i mean the atlanta fed gdp now model is showing over 30 percent growth in the third quarter uh the blue chip forecasters are well over 20 percent uh our view has been 20 plus uh we'll see we'll get that number uh in due course um i'm just saying let's be smart about some of these assistance measures thank you for doing everything haley has the president spoken to the family of rihanna taylor is you
"How are you doing? How are you? So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas. It's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It's now gone. And there was some spikes and surges and other places, they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming. It's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks. And it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience, I was in the hospital. I had it and I got better. And I will tell you that I had something that they gave me, a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time. And I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do. If you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular ventilators we're now making ventilators all over the world, thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away. And as I say, we're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away. No, it's not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance. There are two companies, I think within a matter of weeks and it will be distributed very quickly. Johnson & Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe. No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular that's the head of logistics and this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go. As soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have a 100 million vials. As soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go. I don't think we're going to have a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ""Oh, I should have moved quicker,"" but he didn't move quicker. He was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal, but it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said, ""It was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn't know what we were doing."" Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also, everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make, that's what we've done. We've done all of it. But he was way behind us. I didn't say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know. He's obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that. By the way I as the president couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And Kirsten, every meeting I had, every meeting I had and I'd meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had to. It would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, ""This is dangerous and you catch it."" And I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover- 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation. Excuse me. I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. And you know what? It's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves. Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that, but just to finish this, when I closed he said I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, ""This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic."" I think he called me racist even, because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. Joe, it doesn't. You certainly did. You certainly did. He thought I shouldn't have closed the border, that's obvious. I think we have to respond, if I might. Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shut downs. But forget about him. His Democrat Governors, Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all, they're shut down so tight and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shut downs. No, we're not going to shut down. And we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son, he also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess, it's their immune system. I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small. But I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this. We can't keep this country closed. This is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. I've said it often, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening. And he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down. By the way, I will say this, If you go and look at what's happened to New York, it's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these are restaurants that had dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting up plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. These are businesses that are dying, Joe. You can't do that to people. You just can't. Take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York. Kristen, New York has lost more than 40,000 people, 11,000 people in nursing homes. When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now, it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina, they're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe. You can't let that happen. We have to open up. And we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems. And we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases. I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. ... think to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony, but he did say, ""Don't wear masks."" He did say, as you know, ""This is not going to be a problem."" I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ""This is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all."" When Joe says that I said, Anthony Fauci said, and others, and many others. And I'm not knocking him, nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot. But Anthony said ""Don't wear masks,"" now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here's his exact words. ""This is no problem. This is going to go away soon."" So he's allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person. Well, this is what I-  I don't know. Somebody went through Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. Joe, you have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money deals are made, Joe. I could raise so much more money. As President, and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America. I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street, because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to  Don't tell me about . Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And someday you're going to have to explain, why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night. I knew all about that. And through John — who is John Ratcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI — he said, ""The one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to- ... them. They both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia, between the sanctions, between all of what I've done with NATO. I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra $130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That's to guard against Russia. I sold, while he was selling pillows and sheets, I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the submarine port, you remember that very well, during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice-president when some of this was happening, and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now. First of all, I called my accountants, underwrote it, I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it. And it'll show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, ""What did I pay?"" They said, ""Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars."" I prepaid my tax, over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that. Nobody told you that. Excuse me. And it wasn't written. Whenever they write this, they keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee, but let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China. You do. I don't make money from Ukraine. You do. I don't make money from Russia. You made $3.5 million, Joe, and your son gave you, they even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not, but you're the big man, I think. Your son said we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible. As soon as the auditors finish. I get treated worse than the tea party got treated, because I have a lot of people in there- ... deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled until I decide to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars and it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid . Everybody knows. So... I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied of my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this, Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent $1 million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong because the kind of things- ... that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken, I mean, your brother made money in Iraq- ... millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well, you have houses all over the place. You live very well. ... But could I just one thing? His son didn't have a job for a long time, was, sadly, no longer in the military service, I won't get into that, and he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice-president, Burisma, not the best reputation in the world, I hear they paid him $183,000 a month, listen to this, $183,000, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest. I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to, which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed, the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe. And then I decided, because I was going to do... I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it and I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it. Excuse me. And then, unlike him where he's vice-president and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the vice-president of the United States and his son, his brother, and his other brother are getting rich. They're like a vacuum cleaner. They're sucking up money . No, no, no. Excuse me. No, I have to... Excuse me. No, I have to respond to that. His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China to ... ... after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force Two. Number one. Number two, there's a very strong email talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions. No, but wait a minute. First of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion. I just gave $28 billion to our farmers. It's what? No, no. You know who the taxpayer is? It's called China. China pays 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know got the money? Our farmers, our great farmers, because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel industry. And now we have a steel industry. That is a typical statement. Excuse me. Just for one second, please. That's a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks, ""The family around the table, everything."" Just a typical politician when I see that. I'm not a typical politician. That's why I got elected. Let's get off the subject of China. Let's talk about sitting around the table. Come on, Joe. You could do better. No. So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning, had a great conversation. Was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said, ""The biggest problem we have is North Korea."" He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him. Different kind of a guy, but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there's no war. And about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ""Oh, there's going to be trouble."" I said, ""No, they're not, because he's not going to do that."" And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people, Seoul is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people. Millions of people would be dead right now. We don't have a war and I have a good relationship. Kristen. They tried to meet with him. He wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it. I know for a fact. They tried. We wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what? North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship. People don't understand. Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing. And it didn't happen. Excuse me. He left me a mess. Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess, and in fact, if you remember the first two or three months. It was a very dangerous period in my first three months before we worked things out a little bit. There was a very day. They left us a mess, and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it, was the single biggest problem he thought that our country . First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, I terminated. It's gone. Now, it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, run it as well as you can, to my people, great people, run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down. Everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it'll be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare, because without the individual mandate, it's much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better healthcare, much better. We'll always protect people with pre-existing. So I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it, because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we're going to win the House. You'll see, but I think we're going to win the House. But come up with a better healthcare, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. And one thing very important, we have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare. Far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their healthcare. People that have been successful, middle-income people, been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families. Under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won't even have a choice, they want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job at healthcare, and we're going to do even better. Just you watch. Excuse me. He was there- ... for 47 years. He didn't do it. He was now there as vice president for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters... It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it. His vice president, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine, just like you want it with fracking. ""We're not going to have fracking. We're going to stop fracking. We're going to stop fracking."" Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets a nomination, where he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ""Oh, we're going to have fracking."" And you never ask that question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year, there will be no fracking. There will be no petroleum- No, no. But that's a big question. It's the same thing with socialized medicine. Kristen, when he says- When he says public option, he's talking about socialized medicine and healthcare. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying- ... and destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They wanted to make it work. It was impossible to work. It doesn't work. He tried to get rid of- He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. Years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago. One thing. But this is the guy- ... that when they announced last week- They say the stock market will boom if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash. The biggest analysts are saying that. 401(k)s. Kristen, 401(k)s are through the roof. People's stock are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. He lived there for a short period of time before he even knew it. And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will show you that. They understand. Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do. I do. But I still have to get, unfortunately... That's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything because she'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing, and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one, she doesn't want. It's near the election. Because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically. If we made a deal, the Republicans will pass it. The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrat cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars, to these guys. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And I'd love to do that. I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with COVID, as per your question. But it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states. Excuse me. One thing very quickly. He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That's not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. It's very important. We have to help our small businesses. How are you helping your small businesses when you're forcing wages? What's going to happen, and what's been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees. Say it. Say it. What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent- But what I really like... In a second administration. But not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I've lived- ... in different places. I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $ 15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings. Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels...  and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have as strong a border as we've ever had. We're over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers. And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through - But let me just tell you. Let me just tell you. They built cages. They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, ""Look at these cages. President Trump built them."" And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him. They built cages. Yes. We're working on it very... We're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs. Kristen, they did it. We changed the policy. They did it. We changed. They built the cages. Who built the cages, Joe? Kristen, I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters, everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean. They have gotten such good... But just ask one question. Who built the cages? I'd love you to ask him that. Who built the cages, Joe? Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed. Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years he was Vice President. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in. So important. It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in. A rapist would come in. A very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ""Come back in two years, three years. We're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason. We're going to give you a court case."" When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really... I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few. You don't know the law, Joe. Well, check it out. They don't come back. But we don't have to worry about it, because they terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it anymore, Joe. Go ahead."
economic recovery since the great depression terrorism was on the rise around the world and we'd witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values but in three short years we rebuild our military we revived the american economy we secured our border supported law enforcement stood for life liberty and the constitution of the united states of america it's been america first and america first all starts with the national defense you know when we took office we'd seen years of reckless budget cuts to our national defense when joe biden was vice president of the united states but president donald trump he actually signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of ronald reagan and i have to tell you not just as your vice president but as the proud father of a united states marine and the father-in-law of a united states navy pilot i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has fought every day to give our men and women of our armed forces the resources and the support that they need to defend this nation we're doing it we've rebuilt our military we haven't just stood with those who haven't just stood with those who wear the uniform we've stood with those who've worn the uniform of the united states i mean are there veterans in the audience today could you put your hand or your hat in the air just give us a chance to say thank you one more time thank you for your service thank you for your service it's amazing to think when we took office we go through years of scandals at the va you all remember here in new hampshire when joe biden was vice president we literally had veterans who were perishing waiting to receive treatment at va hospitals when president donald trump walked into the oval office everything changed we passed the most sweeping reforms of the va in 50 years we fired thousands of va employees that were not giving our veterans the care that they earned in the uniform of the united states and veterans choice is now available for every veteran in america so we stood strong with those who serve and we'd sit strong with those who did so and all along the way president donald trump revived our economy with the time-honored principles of freedom free markets and free enterprise and after the slowest recovery since the great depression we created the greatest economy in american history it's amazing to think when joe biden was vice president they tried to tax and spend and bail and regulate their way back to a growing economy you remember those things i mean the american economy recovered in spite of the policies of the obama by the administration and now in the midst of a global pandemic joe biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars just at a time that america is coming back president trump we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses large and small we rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history we fought for free and fair trade that put america first we unleashed american energy and in just three short years seven million jobs were created by businesses large and small including 19 000 jobs right here in the granite state i mean i'm proud to report to you under president trump's policies and leadership average hourly earnings grew faster in our first three years than in all eight years when joe biden was vice president and wages rose most rapidly for hard-working blue-collar americans the forgotten men and women of america were forgotten no more you know and on health care you all remember the disaster of obamacare remember the big three promises they said if you like your doctor you can keep that wasn't true they said if you like your health insurance you can keep it that wasn't true they said health insurance premiums would go down you know when we took office health insurance premiums had actually doubled in the wake of obamacare and now joe biden wants to double down on the failed policies of obamacare he and kamala harris actually support adding a public option to obamacare straight out of bernie sanders agenda it'll set us on an inevitable path to socialize medicine but under president donald trump we're going to keep lowering the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government we've lowered the cost of prescription drugs we passed right to try we're going to have the best health care in the world and we will never be a socialist country so it's been about jobs it's been about prosperity rolling back red tape giving the american people a health care system built on the principles of free enterprise when it comes to economic policy our international trade here in new hampshire and all across america is vitally important the truth is when we took office half of our international trade deficit was with communist china joe biden's been a cheerleader for communist china all along the way and closer to home in the decades that followed the passage of nafta remember democrats always used to like to talk about everything that was wrong with nafta but joe biden never lifted a finger to reform nafta as literally thousands of factories closed across the country and those jobs were shipped south of the border and overseas it's amazing to think after all those empty promises and all those failed policies president trump stepped into the oval office we put china on notice we said the era of economic surrender is over we impose tariffs on china and will keep standing strong on china until they open their markets to american goods and protect the private property rights of american enterprise and on nafta the guy that wrote the art of the deal got america a great deal nafta is gone the usmca is now the law of the land and energy is a critical part it's a critical part of family budgets and business budgets and a growing economy you all in new hampshire deserve to know joe biden and the radical left want to crush american energy under a 2 trillion version of the green new deal it would literally raise the cost of electricity for every household and every business in new hampshire i mean it's incredible when you think about it i mean president trump actually had to remind joe biden in that last presidential debate that he supported the great new deal but i gotta tell you very much difference between aoc green new deal and joe biden and kamala harris's green new deal and that's just how usa today identified i mean the truth is joe biden is talking about mandates out of washington dc that would stifle american jobs and economies he said he wants to abolish fossil fuels in this country under president donald trump we've unleashed american energy and under the policies of this president we've developed the vast natural resources of this nation and we're now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years now when joe biden was vice president you all might remember america actually lost 200 000 manufacturing jobs you remember the last president that summertime in 2016. i heard he's in philadelphia today but he probably won't bring this up so i will the last president actually said that those manufacturing jobs in america were never coming back 200 000 were gone for good right i mean from you know i'm from out in the heartland and these people like calling our neck to the woods the rust belt and there was a lot of rust on the belt when they were in charge right remember barack obama said what magic wand do you have well we didn't need a magic wand we just needed president donald trump in the white house five hundred thousand manufacturing jobs created in just three years including three thousand right here in new hampshire i mean it's just incredible when you think about the progress that we make this president has been a champion all along the way of american jobs and american workers as i stand before you today men and women we have a choice to make a truthful in this election come november 3rd it's going to be a choice between a trump recovery and abiding depression i mean just yesterday a nonpartisan study came out that said under joe biden's economic policies america would lose 5 million jobs and the average household income in america in the coming years would drop by thousand five hundred dollars a year it's no real surprise when you're gonna raise taxes by four trillion dollars we're gonna drop a two trillion dollar version of the green new deal on top of the american economy when you're talking about driving out and abolishing american energy and going back to economic surrender it's no surprise i mean in every day between now and election day you gotta you gotta ask yourself your neighbors and your friends of worship and at work i mean who do you really think is going to bring this economy all the way back is it a proven job creator that put timeless free market principles into practice and saw seven million jobs created or a career politician who spent 47 years in washington raising taxes stifling our economy under an avalanche of regulation and economic surrender so men and women of new hampshire for our families for our jobs for economic freedom and the american comeback we need four more years of president donald trump in the white house so it's been about security it's been about prosperity we fought for american energy and american workers in every step of the way president donald trump has stood for the rule of law i'm proud to report to you that as i stand here today this president's appointed more than 200 conservatives to our federal courts at every level and they are all men and women who will uphold the god-given liberties enshrined in our constitution like the freedom of religion the freedom of speech and the second amendment right to keep and bear arms and i'll tell you what we'll always defend the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press at a time when big tech is actually trying to censor what americans read or see or say we're going to take a stand you all might have seen yesterday the justice department launched an anti-trust lawsuit against google while big tech is trying to protect joe biden president donald trump and i will always fight to protect your freedom of speech we're not gonna let big tech block the truth not now not ever when you think of the rule of law we think of last month we paused as a nation to rightly honor the life and service of the late justice ruth bader ginsburg but when the memorials were over president trump fulfilled his constitutional duty and he nominated a remarkable  principle conservative woman who loves the constitution to the supreme court of the united states he nominated judge amy coney barrett isn't she great now the president and i are calling on democrats to give judge barrett a respectful and dignified confirmation but we have reason to be concerned and you all remember a couple years ago during her last confirmation to the court of appeals the leading democrat on the judiciary committee actually criticized judge barrett's catholic faith she said it was a concern saying and i quote the dogma lives loudly within you and hollywood elites have already begun to criticize judge barrett's faith well i got news for the democrats and their friends in hollywood that dogma lives loudly in me that dogma lives loudly in you and the freedom to live to work to worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the constitution of the united states of america it's who we are it's our freedom so the senate's got a job to do and after they discharge their duty this week and early next to advise and consent i'll make you predictions judge amy coney barrett is going to be justice amy coney barrett we're going to fill that seat on the supreme court of the united states now while we're talking about supreme court people here in this freedom-loving state deserve to know after 150 years with nine justices on the supreme court of the united states leading democrats in washington are actually talking about backing the program adding seats to the court so they can appoint liberal activist judges to drive their agenda from the judicial branch mean last saturday last thursday night joe biden said in his town hall that he's quote open to considering packing the court kamala harris said in the primary she was quote absolutely open and when i when i asked her during the vice presidential debate what the answer was she refused to give me a straight answer now joe biden is telling the american people that he'll tell us what he's going to do after judge barrett is confirmed next week even though millions of americans are voting right now i mean come on man the american people deserve a straight answer when you're running for the highest office in the land you gotta tell america whether you respect the highest court in the land am i right i mean come on you know i was born in the morning but not yesterday morning we all know the answer joe biden and kamala harris aren't answering the question because we already know the answer joe biden democratic party and the radical left are going to pack the court with liberal activist judges if they win this election but we're not going to let it happen we're going to re-elect a republican majority in the senate and we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years the stakes are just that high many women pack into court like these democrats are planning to do that be the greatest power grab in american history we got to talk to our neighbors and friends about it and about the states i mean it's just one more reason by right after you reelect president donald trump you've got to send corky messner to the united states senate corki messner will stand for the constitution the rule of law and independent judiciary so we've stood for the rule of law and every single day i've served alongside this president i've seen it president donald trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will you know the president i know what you know that is the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best people in this country in every day they put on that uniform and strap on a sidearm they walk out the door kiss their families goodbye they count our lives more important than their own those who serve in law enforcement deserve the respect of every american every single day would you all mind showing these police officers who are with us today just how much we appreciate the job they do when they protect and serve our families every day thank you for that you know president trump and i will always support the right of peaceful protest enshrined in the constitution but rioting and looting is not peaceful protest burning businesses is not free speech and for months all joe biden and his running mate talked about were peaceful protesters remember literally as we saw businesses in our major cities burned to the ground i was in minneapolis just a few weeks ago standing at uh the ruins of uh a flora westbrook salon floor is a wonderful african-american business owner started that salon in minneapolis 35 years ago it became a centerpiece of the community and she told me the story about just days after the killing of george floyd how she saw the violent protesters come closer and closer and closer to her business until the night they burned her up men and women i'm gonna tell you i told flora that day we're going to rebuild we're going to rebuild bigger and better than ever before and we're going to have law and order for her and for every american in every city of every race and creed and color so help us god i mean the truth is joe biden would double down on the policies that are leading to violence in our major cities when you start to erode support for those who protect and serve our families you just embolden those who would do violence for those we love and to our community now joe biden explains it all by saying that america is in his words systemically racist and he and his running mate repeatedly say that police officers have a quote implicit bias against minorities when he was asked if he support cutting funding for law enforcement joe biden said yes absolutely and his running mate kamala harris actually praised the mayor of los angeles for cutting 150 million dollars out of the budget of the lapd let me make your promise under president donald trump we're not going to defund the police not now not ever we're going to back the blue for four more years i mean the president i know what you all know we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our african-american neighbors and friends and minorities and everyone that lives in our cities i mean i couldn't be more proud to be a vice president to a president who supported funding for the hiring of four thousand new police officers when violence outbreak that broke out this summer we literally searched federal officials in operation legend every major city in the country and we've arrested nearly 3 000 violent offenders already restoring peace to our streets but at the same time in that same period of time because of this president's policies we saw the lowest unemployment ever recorded for african americans we created more than 8 000 opportunity zones for inner city families we signed historically black colleges universities their largest budgets ever and made them permanent and we have fought for educational choice for every family in every city in america so i promise you we're going to keep supporting law enforcement we're going to keep supporting our african-american neighbors with more jobs more opportunities better education more public safety and we're going to do it all for four more years so we stood for the rule of law stood with those who defend our families at home and abroad and when it comes to values i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who has stood for the religious freedom of every american of every faith every single day president donald trump is the greatest champion of people of faith in america in my lifetime and i couldn't be more proud to serve alongside a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life you all deserve to know that joe biden and kamala harris actually support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth they're calling for historic increases to planned parenthood of america and they want to restore funding to promote abortion around the world but i promise you president donald trump is the most pro-life president in american history and we're going to stand for the right to life for four more  years so in our first three years amazing to think what we all accomplished we rebuilt our military we revived our economy we stood for law and order liberties and life and that's why that's why we need to not only re-elect president donald trump for four more years not only send corey messner to the united states senate but we need to send matt mowers to a new republican majority in the united states house of representatives and retired nancy pelosi once and for all i mean when you look at what we were able to accomplish when we had republican majorities in the house and the senate men and women in new hampshire you know the job before it's amazing to think in three short years president of the white house with our allies in the house and the senate only one way you can describe it in three short years we made america great again right we just did and then 2020 hit and the corona virus struck from china but i can tell you firsthand before the first documented case of community spread in the united states president trump did what no american president had ever done before he suspended all travel from china the second largest economy in the world now joe biden said that was xenophobic he said it was hysterical he actually wrote a few days earlier that that banning travel from anywhere in the world would actually make things worse but i can tell you joe biden's wrong as head of the white house coronavirus task force i can i can attest firsthand president trump's decision to suspend all travel from china saved untold american lives and it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since world war ii we reinvented testing we saw to the manufacturer in the distribution of billions of supplies we've created new medicines called therapeutics that are literally saving lives every single day and we're just a matter of weeks away from having the first safe and effective coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses available for the american people that's what leadership looks like in fact the president just announced last week a plan with cvs and walgreens to deliver and administer vaccines to our seniors in nursing homes for free all across america the moment it becomes available i mean with the incredible cooperation of the people of this state and this country putting the health of your families and neighbors first with our incredible doctors and nurses health care providers and first responders with the partnership at the state level and the leadership of this president we're protecting the vulnerable we've given the american people everything we need to make sure that anyone impacted by the coronavirus has the support to get the health care that we want any member of our family to have and we're saving lives and where joe biden is talking about shutting down the economy we're opening up america again i mean in just the last five months after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic with that strong foundation that president trump poured with your support in our first three years with the unprecedented relief and recovery efforts four trillion dollars made available to families and businesses we've already seen eleven and a half million americans go back to work including sixty 61 000 people right here in new hampshire we're opening up america and we're opening up america's schools i'm proud to report to you mr pence is already back in the classroom teaching at a little christian school just outside our nation's country so we're going to keep those supplies rolling until the day comes that we have that vaccine and we can put this coronavirus in the past and for all the progress we made it's a testament to our president's leadership an incredible free enterprise system great research companies great doctors and nurses let me also say it is a testament here in new hampshire the strong and compassionate leadership of governor chris sununu so we're moving our country forward we've gone through a time of testing but in just 13 days we're going to come to a time for choosing which is why i'm out here and you're out here in the drizzle today in new hampshire you know when you look at their agenda higher taxes open borders socialized medicine a green new deal defunding the police packing the courts it's clear joe biden would be nothing more than a trojan horse for the radical left now joe biden says that democracy is on the ballot well i think our economic recovery is on the ballot i think law and order are on the ballot but i think there are things much more foundational to our nation i think in this election it's not so much whether we're going to end up more republican or more democrat more conservative or more liberal more red or more blue new hampshire the choice in this election i believe is whether america remains american it's going to be a choice of whether we build a future on all the timeless principles enshrined in that constitution benjamin franklin walked out independence hall and he was asked in 1787 what former government they'd created he said a republic if you can keep men and women i think this is a choice such time as this this choice about whether we're going to keep the republic it's whether we're going to chart a course based on freedom limited government the ideals and the liberties and the principles enshrined in our founding document or whether we're going to let joe biden and the democratic party take us on a path of american decline so let me say for our freedom for our republic for all the ideals that have always made america great we need to decide right here and right now that joe biden will never be president of the united states we're going to re-elect president donald trump for four more years and with four more years as the president says we're gonna accomplish so much for this country with four more years we'll distribute a vaccine and we'll defeat the virus four more years we'll maintain america's unrivaled military might and ensure peace through american strength the four more years we'll make america into the manufacturing superpower of the world and end reliance on china once and for all we'll uphold religious liberty freedom of speech the right to keep and bear arms we'll hire more police we will ban sanctuary cities we will stop the indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education in our schools and as president trump said that mount rushmore will teach our children to love our country honor our history and always respect our great american flag and we'll live by those timeless words your motto is live free or not our motto is all of us is in god we trust and i got to tell you men and women in new hampshire i'm just very grateful you came out on a soggy day to see your vice president i'm really very honored i have to tell you it's the greatest honor of my life to be your vice president and i thank you for that great honor and for your support you know i actually didn't know the president very well before he called me four years ago and asked me to join this ticket but we've got to be very close some people think we're a little bit different but i got to tell you i've seen this president when all the cameras are off and all the bright lights are off and i can tell you firsthand having served shoulder to shoulder with him over these last four years there has never been a day that president donald trump against unprecedented opposition and attacks there has never been a day president donald trump hasn't gotten up and fought to keep the promises that he made to the people of new hampshire now it's our turn to fight for him it's on new hampshire it's on so before i get back on that plane and head to ohio i got a couple things to ask of you over the next 13 days first thing i need you to do is vote new hampshire vote to re-elect president donald trump to the white house and i heard the last day to register before the election here in portsmouth it's going to be next wednesday october 28th so if you're not registered yet go to the city clerk's office on one junkins avenue normal wednesday hours 8 a.m to 4 30. there's still time if you're not registered to vote get registered to vote today in fact i checked out on the way here you can go and request an absentee ballot until election day you can mail it in and drop it off at the very same location mr pence and i are going to do that in the hoosier state in just a couple days so we need you to vote new hampshire and remember friends don't let friends vote alone grab a family member grab a neighbor grab a co-worker and vote to re-elect president donald trump okay so after you vote with a friend second thing i wanted to ask you to do is just go tell somebody okay i mean i got to tell you four years ago i never doubted that this president was going to win in that election and i don't doubt it today because i know the american people then and now we're talking to each other i mean the people of this state knew we could be strong again you knew we could be prosperous again you were talking to your neighbors and friends about those timeless ideals of this country and you saw in donald trump not just the vision but the leadership qualities to make america great again and so go tell your neighbors and friends say you know i went out to the airport the other day it was raining and mike came out he ran every bit as fast as he could and then he talked to us like for an hour out in the rain just about everything we've done about the choice that we face and about everything we can do for america with four more years of president donald trump in the white house you got to go tell him so after you vote with a friend after you tell your neighbors and friends every day for the next 13 days i encourage you to do one more thing you know traveling all across this country over the last four years i'm convinced of two things in this live free or dive state this is a freedom loving nation and this is a nation of faith i mean i had a little girl in that vice presidential debate turned in a question at the end where she said she was watching tv and it just looked like there was so much that divides us but after traveling across america i'm more convinced than ever that there will always be more that unites us in these united states of america than will ever divide us and chief among those things is of faith in the american people and so if you're among those who on occasion bend the knee and bow the head over the next 13 days i encourage you to do that too and when you pray pray with confidence those ancient words that if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he'll do like he's always done in the long and storied history of this state and nation he'll hear from heaven and he'll heal this land this one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all so pray for america pray for all of the american people it'll make a difference new hampshire so thanks again for coming out today you all are just you're like the greatest i can't wait to get on the phone and tell them i see you said your wingman was in new hampshire and we were all out there getting rained on and they you all just fanta give yourselves a round of   for coming out on a rainy day thank you so much i leave here today with renewed confidence that if all of us do all that we need to do between now and november 3rd we're going to have a great victory all across new hampshire and all across america because as this president often says we're one movement one people one family and one glorious nation and i just know together we're going to make new hampshire and america stronger than ever before we're going to make new hampshire and america more prosperous than you could possibly imagine going to make new hampshire and america more united than ever before and with corey messner in a renewed republican majority in the united states senate with matt mowers in a new republican majority in the house of representatives with governor chris sununu back at the state house and with president donald trump in the white house for four more years and with god's help we will make america great again again thank you all very much god bless you god bless america let's go get it done new hampshire  oh
"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America: Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.  Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice –- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands.  And we will use it to light up the world.  I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our Nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children? I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land. We've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet.  The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns. But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake – and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. Dying industries will come roaring back to life.  Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises. Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.  We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government.  We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers. We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials –- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government. We have undertaken a historic effort to eliminate job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. With the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation. We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.  By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.  We want all Americans to succeed –- but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos.  We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens.  Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question:  what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States.  We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.  We have seen the attacks at home -– from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center. We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur.  Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm. As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have s ed Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.  We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution.  I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight.  Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice.  To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law.  He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined. We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.  It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.  At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and workers. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing. I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson.  In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business?  They said that it's good.  I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales.  They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.  They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't even asking for change.  But I am. I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ""abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government  produce want and ruin among our people."" Lincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I am going to bring back millions of jobs.  Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration.  The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others –- have a merit-based immigration system.  It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially.  Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year. Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits:  it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families –- including immigrant families –- enter the middle class. Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program –- the building of the interstate highway system.  The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.  With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country –- twice.  And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital –- creating millions of new jobs. This effort will be guided by two core principles:  Buy American, and Hire American. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare. Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.  The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits.  As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone.  Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing. One third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges –- leaving many Americans with no choice at all. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been broken. Obamacare is collapsing –- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans.  Action is not a choice –- it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans: First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts –- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government. Thirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance – and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately. Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines –- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care. Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed.  Every problem can be solved.  And every hurting family can find healing, and hope. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more –- so why not join forces to finally get it done?  On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people. My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. An incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.  Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old.  She was not expected to live past 5. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child.  He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life.  Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. In fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. I am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children.  These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them. Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.  As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice.  But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program.  Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college.  Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone –- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. But to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement. We must build bridges of cooperation and trust –- not drive the wedge of disunity and division. Police and sheriffs are members of our community.  They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.  The office is called VOICE –- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement.  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.  Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback.  But he never got the chance.  His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis.  Their husbands –- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis –- were slain in the line of duty in California.  They were pillars of their community.  These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.  Jenna:  I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica:  I want you to know –- we will never stop fighting for justice.  Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and –- if they must –- to fight and to win. I am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this Nation –- and now we must deliver for them. The challenges we face as a Nation are great.  But our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens.  Ryan died as he lived:  a warrior, and a hero –- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation. I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.""  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.  For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.  Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him. To those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world.  It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe. We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism. But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific –- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. We will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people –- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.  My job is not to represent the world.  My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past –- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding. America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align.  We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found.  America is friends today with former enemies.  Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars.  This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial.  At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter.  An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask. When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same flag. And we are all made by the same God. And when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over.  The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts. The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls. And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action. From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears –- inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past –- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit.  I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.  And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves. Believe in your future. And believe, once more, in America. Thank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States."
"Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.  How are you? Well I want to thank everybody on stage. They are really a terrific team. We have some of the real winners in the audience, too, that I can tell you—some great, great people. I want to thank Vice President Pence. As always, he’s right there and he has really been a help to this administration. We have some big things happening today, and we have some very big things happening over the next month, and I guess probably I can say over the next eight years. I suspect I can say that.  It’s wonderful to be here with so many pioneers and visionaries from America’s energy industry—great industry. I want to thank the leaders of our great energy companies for joining us today and for supporting our efforts to bring true wealth and prosperity to our people. That’s true. Come on, give yourself a hand.  You deserve it. You deserve it. You’ve gone through eight years of hell, and actually I could say even a little bit more than that. You deserve it. I also want to express our sincere gratitude to the labor union leaders and members who have joined us today. Thank you, fellas. Thank you, thank you.  Your workers embody the skill, grit and courage that has always been the true source of American strength. They are great people. They break through rock walls, mine the depths of the earth, and reach through the ocean floor, to bring every ounce of energy into our homes and commerce and into our lives. Our nation salutes you. You’re brave and you are great workers. Thank you very much. Thank you, fellas.  Before turning to the topic at hand, I want to provide a brief update on two crucial votes taking place this afternoon on the House Floor—very important. These bills are vital to public safety and national security, and I want to thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his efforts. Bob has been working very hard and really for a long time, but we got it going. First, the House will be voting on Kate’s Law—legislation named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with five prior deportations and lots of bad things on his record. The second is the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which blocks federal grants to cities that release dangerous criminal aliens back into the streets, including the vicious and disgusting and horrible MS-13 gang members. And we’re getting them out. We are getting them out. They’re going—fast.  General Kelly and his whole group—they’ve gotten rid of 6,000 so far. We’re about 50 percent there, and we’re actually liberating towns. Like on long Island, where I grew up—we’re liberating towns. Those people are so happy to see our guys, and our guys are a lot tougher than the MS-13 characters. That I can tell you. Liberation.  I’m calling on all lawmakers to put the safety of American families first. And let’s pass these bills through the House, through the Senate, and send them to my desk. I will give you the fastest approval, the fastest signature that you have ever seen. Right, Mike? We will get that signed so fast.  So when we get back, the first thing I’m going to do is how did we do on the vote? I expect good things; otherwise I probably wouldn’t be talking about it to be honest with you. I’d just sort of low-key it a little bit.  I don’t like losing. I don’t like losing.  Neither do you folks. Every member of Congress should vote to save American lives. Many great members of Congress are here with us this afternoon—some great people, some great, great people. Thank you very much. Not only are they working with us on border security, but they share our desire to unleash American energy. I especially want to thank Secretary Perry for his tremendous leadership in this department. He has really done a terrific job, and he’s also a cheerleader—he’s really a cheerleader. I watched that in Texas. The thing that I loved about him—he was always saying how great Texas was. And if you don’t say it, I don’t know. You got to say it, right? And you’re doing it right now with energy.  That’s true. Along with Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. And we’ve been through our battles, Scott. Not with each other, with the world. And now the world is starting to say I think they’re right.  They’ll find out. We have no doubt. But all three of them strongly believe in putting America first, which is what I believe in, which is why I got elected. It’s called Make America Great Again—that’s what we’re doing—Make America Great Again. We’re here today to usher in a new American energy policy—one that unlocks million and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in wealth. For over 40 years, America was vulnerable to foreign regimes that used energy as an economic weapon. Americans’ quality of life was diminished by the idea that energy resources were too scarce to support our people. We always thought that, and actually at the time it was right to think. We didn’t think we had this tremendous wealth under our feet. Many of us remember the long gas lines and the constant claims that the world was running out of oil and natural gas. Americans were told that our nation could only solve this energy crisis by imposing draconian restrictions on energy production. But we now know that was all a big, beautiful myth. It was fake. Don’t we love that term, “fake”? What we’ve learned about fake over the last little while—fake news, CNN. Fake. (Laughter and  .) Whoops, their camera just went off.  Okay, you can come back. I won’t say—I promise I won’t say anything more about you. I see that red light go off, I say, whoa. The truth is that we have near-limitless supplies of energy in our country. Powered by new innovation and technology, we are now on the cusp of a true energy revolution. Our country is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, which we didn’t know of, even five years ago and certainly ten years ago. We have nearly 100 years’ worth of natural gas and more than 250 years’ worth of clean, beautiful coal. We are a top producer of petroleum and the number-one producer of natural gas. We have so much more than we ever thought possible. We are really in the driving seat. And you know what? We don’t want to let other countries take away our sovereignty and tell us what to do and how to do it. That’s not going to happen.  With these incredible resources, my administration will seek not only American energy independence that we’ve been looking for so long, but American energy dominance. And we’re going to be an exporter—exporter.  We will be dominant. We will export American energy all over the world, all around the globe. These energy exports will create countless jobs for our people, and provide true energy security to our friends, partners, and allies all across the globe. But this full potential can only be realized when government promotes energy development—that’s this guy right here, and he’ll do it better than anybody—instead of obstructing it like the Democrats. They obstruct it. But we get through it. We cannot have obstruction. We have to get out and do our job better and faster than anybody in the world, certainly when it comes to one of our great assets—energy. This vast energy wealth does not belong to the government. It belongs to the people of the United States of America.  Yet, for the past eight years, the federal government imposed massive job-killing barriers to American energy development. Since my very first day in office, I have been moving at record pace to cancel these regulations and to eliminate the barriers to domestic energy production, like never before. Job-killing regulations are being removed and vital infrastructure projects are being approved at a level that they’ve never seen before. As you all know, I approved the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline in my first week. Thousands of jobs—tremendous things are happening. And, by the way, I thought I’d take a lot of heat. I didn’t take any heat. I approved them and that was it. I figured we’d have all sorts of protests. We didn’t have anything. But I have to do—whether it’s protesting or not, I have to do what’s right. But people celebrate those two transactions, as opposed to protesting. But sometimes you have to go out and just do it, and you find out. Whatever happens, happens. But you have to be right for the American people.  Thank you. I’m dramatically reducing restrictions on the development of natural gas. I cancelled the moratorium on a new coal leasing—and you know what was happening—the new coal leasing on federal lands, it was being so terribly restricted. And now with Ryan and with a group, it’s going to be open, and the land will be left in better shape than it is right now. Is that right? Better shape.  We have finally ended the war on coal. And I am proud to report that Corsa Coal, here with us today, just opened a brand-new coal mine in the state of Pennsylvania, the first one in many, many, many years. Corsa, stand up. Come on.  Congratulations. Congratulations. Employing a lot of people, and we are putting the coal miners back to work just like I promised—just like I promised when I went through Ohio and West Virginia, Wyoming and all of the different places. And I see Bob back there. Congratulations, Bob. He’s in great shape, right? You in good shape, Bob? Right from the beginning. Good. You just take care of yourself, all right? We’re ending intrusive EPA regulations that kill jobs, hurt family farmers and ranchers, and raise the price of energy so quickly and so substantially. In order to protect American jobs, companies and workers, we’ve withdrawn the United States from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord.  And I won’t get into it, but believe me, that really put this country at a disadvantage. Number one, we weren’t playing on the same field. It kicked in for us, and it doesn’t kick in for others. The money that we had to pay was enormous. It was not even close. And maybe we’ll be back into it someday, but it will be on better terms. It will be on fair terms—not on terms where we’re the people that don’t know what we’re doing. So we’ll see what happens. But I will tell you we’re proud of it. And when I go around, there are so many people that say thank you. You saved the sovereignty of our country. You saved our wealth because we would have a hard time getting to this newfound wealth. And that’s not going to happen with our country.  Today, I am proudly announcing six brand-new initiatives to propel this new era of American energy dominance. First, we will begin to revive and expand our nuclear energy sector—which I’m so happy about—which produces clean, renewable and emissions-free energy. A complete review of U.S. nuclear energy policy will help us find new ways to revitalize this crucial energy resource. And I know you’re very excited about that, Rick. Second, the Department of the Treasury will address barriers to the financing of highly efficient, overseas coal energy plants. Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons right now. There are many other places that need it, too. And we want to sell it to them, and to everyone else all over the globe who need it. Third, my administration has just approved the construction of a new petroleum pipeline to Mexico, which will further boost American energy exports, and that will go right under the wall, right? It’s going under, right? ( ) Have it go down a little deeper in that one section. You know, a little like this. Right under the wall. Fourth, just today, a major U.S. company, Sempra Energy, signed an agreement to begin negotiations for the sale of more American natural gas to South Korea. And, as you know, the leaders of South Korea are coming to the White House today, and we’ve got a lot of discussion to do. But we will also be talking about them buying energy from the United States of America, and I’m sure they’ll like to do it. They need it. Thank you.  Fifth, the United States Department of Energy is announcing today that it will approve two long-term applications to export additional natural gas from the Lake Charles LNG terminal in Louisiana. It’s going to be a big deal. It’s a great announcement. Finally, in order to unlock more energy from the 94 percent of offshore land closed to development, under the previous administration, so much of our land was closed to development. We’re opening it up, the right areas, but we’re opening it up—we’re creating a new offshore oil and gas leasing program. America will be allowed to access the vast energy wealth located right off our shores. And this is all just the beginning—believe me. The golden era of American energy is now underway. And I’ll go a step further: The golden era of America is now underway. Believe me.  And you’re all going to be a part of it in creating this exciting new future. We will bring new opportunity to the heartland, new prosperity to our inner cities, and new infrastructure all across our nation. When it comes to the future of America’s energy needs, we will find it, we will dream it, and we will build it. American energy will power our ships, our planes and our cities. American hands will bend the steel and pour the concrete that brings this energy into our homes and that exports this incredible, newfound energy all around the world. And American grit will ensure that what we dream, and what we build, will truly be second to none. We will be number one again all the way. We’re going to make America great again. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you."
"Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. I am thrilled to be here. Thrilled. And if you think that was an easy trip, you’re wrong. But I am thrilled. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address such a tremendous group. Boy, you have a lot of people here. The press will say it’s about 200 people. It looks like about 45,000 people. You set a record today. You set a record. That’s a great honor, believe me. Tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of that. We’re going to put that… We’re going to put that aside. And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you amazing young Scouts can achieve your dreams, what to think of, what I’ve been thinking about. You want to achieve your dreams, I said, who the hell wants to speak about politics when I’m in front of the Boy Scouts? Right? There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the United States. But looking out at this incredible gathering of mostly young patriots. Mostly young. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.  You are the young people of character, integrity who will serve as leaders of our communities and uphold the sacred values of our nation. I want to thank Boy Scouts President Randall Stephenson, chief Scout executive Michael Surbaugh, Jamboree Chairman Ralph de la Vega and the thousands of volunteers who made this a life-changing experience for all of you. And when they asked me to be here, I said absolutely yes. Finally—and we can’t forgot these people—I especially want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here tonight.  Thank you for making scouting possible. Thank you, mom and dad, troop leaders. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you are not only shaping young lives, you are shaping the future of America. The United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. No better. The values, traditions and skills you learn here will serve you throughout your lives. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and in the present will serve your country. The Scouts believe in putting America first. You know, I go to Washington and I see all these politicians, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In fact, today, I said we ought to change it from the word “swamp” to the word “cesspool” or perhaps to the word “sewer.” But it’s not good. Not good. And I see what’s going on. And believe me, I’d much rather be with you, that I can tell you. I’ll tell you the reason that I love this, and the reason that I really wanted to be here, is because as president, I rely on former Boy Scouts every single day. And so do the American people. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level of our great government. Many of my top advisers in the White House were Scouts. Ten members of my cabinet were Scouts. Can you believe that? Ten. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is not only a Boy Scout, he is your former national president. The vice president of the United States, Mike Pence—a good guy—was a Scout, and it meant so much to him. Some of you here tonight might even have camped out in this yard when Mike was the governor of Indiana, but the scouting was very, very important. And by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? I wonder if the television cameras will follow you? They don’t doing that when they see these massive crowds. They don’t like doing that. Hi, folks. There’s a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. A lot of love. And a lot of love for our country. And a lot of love for our country. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. Come here, Ryan. Ryan is an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. Pretty good. And by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. He makes sure that we leave our national parks and federal lands better than we found them in the best scouting tradition. So thank you very much, Ryan. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from the great state. The first time he came to the National Jamboree was in 1964. He was very young then. And Rick told me just a little while ago, it totally changed his life. So, Rick, thank you very much for being here. And we’re doing—we’re doing a lot with energy.  And very soon, Rick, we will be an energy exporter. Isn’t that nice? An energy exporter. In other words, we’ll be selling our energy instead of buying it from everybody all over the globe. So that’s good. We will be energy dominant. And I’ll tell you what, the folks in West Virginia who were so nice to me, boy, have we kept our promise. We are going on and on. So we love West Virginia. We want to thank you. Where’s West Virginia by the way? Thank you. Secretary Tom Price is also here today. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. And he’s doing a great job. And hopefully he’s going to gets the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as Obamacare that’s really hurting us.  By the way, are you going to get the votes? He better get them. He better get them. Oh, he better. Otherwise I’ll say, “Tom, you’re fired.” I’ll get somebody. He better get Senator Capito to vote for it. He better get the other senators to vote for it. It’s time. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare, we have a chance to now do it. They better do it. Hopefully they’ll do it. As we can see just by looking at our government, in America, Scouts lead the way. And another thing I’ve noticed—and I’ve noticed it all my life—there is a tremendous spirit with being a Scout, more so than almost anything I can think of. So whatever is going on, keep doing it. It’s incredible to watch, believe me. Each of these leaders will tell that you their road to American success—and you have to understand—their American success, and they are a great, great story, was paved with the patriotic American values and traditions they learned in the Boy Scouts. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are doing such a good job for our country. So that’s going to happen. Boy Scout values are American values. And great Boy Scouts become great, great Americans. As the Scout law says, a scout is trustworthy, loyal—we could use some more loyalty I will tell that you that. That was very impressive. You’ve heard that before. But here you learn the rewards of hard work and perseverance, never, ever give up. Never quit. Persevere. Never, ever quit. You learn the satisfaction of building a roaring campfire, reaching a mountain summit or earning a merit badge after mastering a certain skill. There’s no better feeling than an achievement that you’ve earned with your own sweat, tears, resolve, hard work. There’s nothing like it. Do you agree with that? I’m waving to people back there so small I can’t even see them. Man, this is a lot of people. Turn those cameras back there, please. That is so incredible. By the way, what do you think the chances are that this incredible massive crowd, record setting, is going to be shown on television tonight? One percent or zero? The fake media will say, “President Trump spoke”—you know what is—“President Trump spoke before a small crowd of Boy Scouts today.” That’s some—that is some crowd. Fake media. Fake news. Thank you. And I’m honored by that. By the way, all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. I hope you can hear. Through scouting you also learned to believe in yourself—so important—to have confidence in your ability and to take responsibility for your own life. When you face down new challenges—and you will have plenty of them—develop talents you never thought possible, and lead your teammates through daring trials, you discover that you can handle anything. And you learn it by being a Scout. It’s great.  You can do anything. You can be anything you want to be. But in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. You have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. If you don’t—I love you too. I don’t know. Nice guy. Hey, what am I going to do? He sounds like a nice person. He—he, he, he. I do. I do love you. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a Jamboree? And we’ll be back. We’ll be back. The answer is no. But we’ll be back. In life, in order to be successful—and you people are well on the road to success—you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? You have to find it. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will gain momentum? And look, you have to. You need the word “momentum.” You will gain that momentum. And each success will create another success. The word “momentum.” I’ll tell you a story that’s very interesting for me. When I was young there was a man named William Levitt. You have some here. You have some in different states. Anybody ever hear of Levittown? And he was a very successful man, became unbelievable—he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. And he’d build homes, and at night he’d go to these major sites with teams of people, and he’d scour the sites for nails, and sawdust and small pieces of wood, and they cleaned the site, so when the workers came in the next morning, the sites would be spotless and clean, and he did it properly. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of money for his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money, at the time especially. This is a long time ago. Sold his company for a tremendous amount of money. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very interesting life. I won’t go any more than that, because you’re Boy Scouts so I’m not going to tell you what he did. Should I tell you? Should I tell you? You’re Boy Scouts, but you know life. You know life. So look at you. Who would think this is the Boy Scouts, right? So he had a very, very interesting life, and the company that bought his company was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about picking up the nails and the sawdust and selling it, and the scraps of wood. This was a big conglomerate based in New York City. And after about a 10-year period, there were losing a lot with it. It didn’t mean anything to them. And they couldn’t sell it. So they called William Levitt up, and they said, would you like to buy back your company, and he said, yes, I would. He so badly wanted it. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. You won’t get bored, right? You know, truthfully, you’re workers. You’ll get bored too, believe me. Of course having a few good years like that isn’t so bad. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of empty land, and he worked hard at getting zoning, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. He went personally bankrupt, and he was now much older. And I saw him at a cocktail party. And it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. It was the party of Steve Ross—Steve Ross, who was one of the great people. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a great guy. He had a lot of successful people at the party. And I was doing well, so I got invited to the party. I was very young. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see a hundred people, some of whom I recognize, and they’re big in the entertainment business. And I see sitting in the corner was a little old man who was all by himself. Nobody was talking to him. I immediately recognized that that man was the once great William Levitt, of Levittown, and I immediately went over. I wanted to talk to him more than the Hollywood, show business, communications people. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” He said, “I know.” I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?” He goes, “Not well, not well at all.” And I knew that. But he said, “Not well at all.” And he explained what was happening and how bad it’s been and how hard it’s been. And I said, “What exactly happened? Why did this happen to you? You’re one of the greats ever in our industry. Why did this happen to you?” And he said, “Donald, I lost my momentum. I lost my momentum.” A word you never hear when you’re talking about success when some of these guys that never made 10 cents, they’re on television giving you things about how you’re going to be successful, and the only thing they ever did was a book and a tape. But I tell you—I’ll tell you, it was very sad, and I never forgot that moment. And I thought about it, and it’s exactly true. He lost his momentum, meaning he took this period of time off, long, years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum. And if you don’t have it, that’s OK. Because you’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do things that are great. But you have to know about the word “momentum.” But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love. When you do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. But when you do something that you love, you’ll never fail. What you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. You’re ultimately going to be successful. And remember this, you’re not working. Because when you’re doing something that you love, like I do—of course I love my business, but this is a little bit different. Who thought this was going to happen. We’re, you know, having a good time. We’re doing a good job. Doing a good job. But when you do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. So you’ll work 24/7. You’re going to work all the time. And at the end of the year you’re not really working. You don’t think of it as work. When you’re not doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you really don’t like, that’s called work, and it’s hard work, and tedious work. So as much as you can do something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. Now, with that, I have to tell you our economy is doing great. Our stock market has picked up since the election, November 8th—do we remember that day? Was that a beautiful day? What a day. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, these dishonest people, where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. They forgot about the forgotten people. By the way, they’re not forgetting about the forgotten people anymore. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, far too late; it’s far too late. But you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And they didn’t know what to say.  And you know, we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. Popular vote is much easier. We have—because New York, California, Illinois, you have to practically run the East Coast. And we did. We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina. We won Pennsylvania. We won and won. So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. You know I went to Maine four times because it’s one vote, and we won. We won. One vote. I went there because I kept hearing we’re at 269. But then Wisconsin came in. Many, many years. Michigan came in. So—and we worked hard there. You know, my opponent didn’t work hard there, because she was told… ( ) She was told she was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. The car industry is moving to Mexico. Why is she going to move—she’s there. Why are they allowing it to move? And by the way, do you see those car industry—do you see what’s happening? They’re coming back to Michigan. They’re coming back to Ohio. They’re starting to peel back in. And we go to Wisconsin, now, Wisconsin hadn’t been won in many, many years by a Republican. But we go to Wisconsin, and we had tremendous crowds. And I’d leave these massive crowds, I’d say, why are we going to lose this state? The polls, that’s also fake news. They’re fake polls. But the polls are saying—but we won Wisconsin. So I have to tell you, what we did, in all fairness, is an unbelievable tribute to you and all of the other millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again. And I’ll tell you what, we are indeed making America great again.  And I’ll tell you what, we are indeed making America great again. What’s going on is incredible. We had the best jobs report in 16 years. The stock market on a daily basis is hitting an all-time high. We’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars from companies that can’t get their money back into this country, and that money is going to be used to help rebuild America. We’re doing things that nobody ever thought was possible, and we’ve just started. It’s just the beginning, believe me. You know, in the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? You learn to contribute to your communities, to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. You pledge to help other people at all times. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your best and to do your duty to God and your country. And by the way, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me. Merry Christmas. They’ve been downplaying that little beautiful phrase. You’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. But the words “duty,” “country” and “God” are beautiful words. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great American patriot. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service to helping people in your communities. Incredible. That’s an incredible stat. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service by the end of this Jamboree—100,000. When natural disaster strikes, when people face hardship, when the beauty and glory of our outdoor spaces must be restored and taken care of, America turns to the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. Your values are the same values that have always kept America strong, proud and free. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? Billions of dollars. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are so great to us. We love our vets. We love our soldiers. And we love our police, by the way. Firemen, police. We love our police. Those are all special people. Uniformed services. Two days ago I traveled to Norfolk, Virginia to commission an American aircraft carrier into the fleet of the United States Navy. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout—the USS Gerald R. Ford. Everywhere it sails that great Scout’s name will be feared and revered, because that ship will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. Our nation honors President Gerald R. Ford today because he lived his life the scouting way. Boy Scouts celebrate American patriots, especially the brave members of our Armed Forces. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. American hearts are warmed every year when we read about Boy Scouts placing thousands and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. You should take great pride in the example you set for every citizen of our country to follow. Generations of American Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. You inherit a noble American tradition. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of you who you are and the principles you hold dear and stand by. Wear your values as your badge of honor. What you’ve done few have done before you. What you’ve done is incredible. What you’ve done is admired by all. So I want to congratulate you, Boy Scouts. Let your scouting oath guide your path from this day forward. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. You are very special people. You’re special in the lives of America. You’re special to me. But if you do what we say, I promise you that you will live scouting’s adventure every single day of your life, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. Your lives will have meaning, and purpose and joy. You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Things that you said could never, ever happen are already happening for you. And if you do these things, and if you refuse to give in to doubt or to fear, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud of yourself, be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.  And never, ever forget, America is proud of you. This is a very, very special occasion for me. I’ve known so many Scouts over the years. Winners. I’ve known so many great people. They’ve been taught so well, and they love the heritage. But this is very special for me. And I just want to end by saying, very importantly, God bless you. God bless the Boy Scouts. God Bless the United States of America. Go out, have a great time in life, compete, and go out and show me that there is nobody, nobody like a Boy Scout. Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much"
"Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before. Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high—a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve. But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens. To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars—they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity. The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, “Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world. We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success. Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God. In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution—the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law. The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are: “We the people.” Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs. In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government’s first duty is to its people, to our citizens—to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.  All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America’s interests above all else. But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it’s in everyone’s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America’s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values. That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow? If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. We were all witness to the regime’s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator’s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies. If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That’s what the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is for. Let’s see how they do. It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved. But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime—one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room. The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program.  The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it—believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran’s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors. The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation’s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again? The Iranian regime’s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that s  innocent people. The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined. We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens—even innocent children—shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach. For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries. For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms. For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government. I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President’s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe. We also thank—( )—we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution’s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it. Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.  The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented.  From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America’s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the “independent strength of its members.” If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations—nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit. In remembering the great victory that led to this body’s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats—we can’t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens? One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was “effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people.” That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and—world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul. So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Please. I want to thank Vice President Pence, along with the many members of my Cabinet here with us today. I also want to thank all of the dedicated professionals—military, civilian, and law enforcement—who devote their lives to serving our nation. In particular, I want to recognize General Dunford and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thank you, thank you, thank you.  In addition, we are honored to be joined by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you.  Let me begin by expressing our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers for the victims of the train derailment in Washington State. We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities. It is all the more reason why we must start immediately fixing the infrastructure of the United States. We’re here today to discuss matters of vital importance to us all: America’s security, prosperity, and standing in the world. I want to talk about where we’ve been, where we are now, and, finally, our strategy for where we are going in the years ahead. Over the past 11 months, I have traveled tens of thousands of miles to visit 13 countries. I have met with more than 100 world leaders. I have carried America’s message to a grand hall in Saudi Arabia, a great square in Warsaw, to the General Assembly of the United Nations, and to the seat of democracy on the Korean Peninsula. Everywhere I traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the American people. Throughout our history, the American people have always been the true source of American greatness. Our people have promoted our culture and promoted our values. Americans have fought and sacrificed on the battlefields all over the world. We have liberated captive nations, transformed former enemies into the best of friends, and lifted entire regions of the planet from poverty to prosperity. Because of our people, America has been among the greatest forces for peace and justice in the history of the world. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. On November 8, 2016, you voted to make America great again.  You embraced new leadership and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope. That is why we are here today. But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. For many years, our citizens watched as Washington politicians presided over one disappointment after another. To many of our leaders—so many who forgot whose voices they were to respect and whose interests they were supposed to defend—our leaders in Washington negotiated disastrous trade deals that brought massive profits to many foreign nations, but sent thousands of American factories, and millions of American jobs, to those other countries. Our leaders engaged in nation-building abroad, while they failed to build up and replenish our nation at home. They undercut and shortchanged our men and women in uniform with inadequate resources, unstable funding, and unclear missions. They failed to insist that our often very wealthy allies pay their fair share for defense, putting a massive and unfair burden on the U.S. taxpayer and our great U.S. military. They neglected a nuclear menace in North Korea; made a disastrous, weak, and incomprehensibly bad deal with Iran; and allowed terrorists such as ISIS to gain control of vast parts of territory all across the Middle East. They put American energy under lock and key. They imposed punishing regulations and crippling taxes. They surrendered our sovereignty to foreign bureaucrats in faraway and distant capitals. And over the profound objections of the American people, our politicians left our borders wide open. Millions of immigrants entered illegally. Millions more were admitted into our country without the proper vetting needed to protect our security and our economy. Leaders in Washington imposed on the country an immigration policy that Americans never voted for, never asked for, and never approved—a policy where the wrong people are allowed into our country and the right people are rejected. American citizens, as usual, have been left to bear the cost and to pick up the tab. On top of everything else, our leaders drifted from American principles. They lost sight of America’s destiny. And they lost their belief in American greatness. As a result, our citizens lost something as well. The people lost confidence in their government and, eventually, even lost confidence in their future. But last year, all of that began to change. The American people rejected the failures of the past. You rediscovered your voice and reclaimed ownership of this nation and its destiny. On January 20th, 2017, I stood on the steps of the Capitol to herald the day the people became the rulers of their nation again.  Thank you. Now, less than one year later, I am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has already seen the signs. America is coming back, and America is coming back strong. Upon my inauguration, I announced that the United States would return to a simple principle: The first duty of our government is to serve its citizens, many of whom have been forgotten. But they are not forgotten anymore. With every decision and every action, we are now putting America first. We are rebuilding our nation, our confidence, and our standing in the world. We have moved swiftly to confront our challenges, and we have confronted them head-on. We are once again investing in our defense—almost $700 billion, a record, this coming year. We are demanding extraordinary strength, which will hopefully lead to long and extraordinary peace. We are giving our courageous military men and women the support they need and so dearly deserve. We have withdrawn the United States from job-killing deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the very expensive and unfair Paris Climate Accord. And on our trip to Asia last month, I announced that we will no longer tolerate trading abuse. We have established strict new vetting procedures to keep terrorists out of the United States, and our vetting is getting tougher each month. To counter Iran and block its path to a nuclear weapon, I sanctioned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support of terrorism, and I declined to certify the Iran Deal to Congress. Following my trip to the Middle East, the Gulf states and other Muslim-majority nations joined together to fight radical Islamist ideology and terrorist financing. We have dealt ISIS one devastating defeat after another. The coalition to defeat ISIS has now recaptured almost 100 percent of the land once held by these terrorists in Iraq and Syria. Great job.  Great job. Really good. Thank you. Thank you. We have a great military. We’re now chasing them wherever they flee, and we will not let them into the United States. In Afghanistan, our troops are no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies of our plans. We are beginning to see results on the battlefield. And we have made clear to Pakistan that while we desire continued partnership, we must see decisive action against terrorist groups operating on their territory. And we make massive payments every year to Pakistan. They have to help. Our efforts to strengthen the NATO Alliance set the stage for significant increases in member contributions, with tens of billions of dollars more pouring in because I would not allow member states to be delinquent in the payment while we guarantee their safety and are willing to fight wars for them. We have made clear that countries that are immensely wealthy should reimburse the United States for the cost of defending them. This is a major departure from the past, but a fair and necessary one—necessary for our country, necessary for our taxpayer, necessary for our own thought process. Our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime has resulted in the toughest-ever sanctions. We have united our allies in an unprecedented effort to isolate North Korea. However, there is much more work to do. America and its allies will take all necessary steps to achieve a denuclearization and ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world.  Thank you. This situation should have been taken care of long before I got into office, when it was much easier to handle. But it will be taken care of. We have no choice. At home, we are keeping our promises and liberating the American economy. We have created more than 2 million jobs since the election. Unemployment is at a 17-year-low. The stock market is at an all-time high and, just a little while ago, hit yet another all-time high—the 85th time since my election.  We have cut 22 regulations for every one new regulation, the most in the history of our country. We have unlocked America’s vast energy resources. As the world watches—and the world is indeed watching—we are days away from passing historic tax cuts for American families and businesses. It will be the biggest tax cut and tax reform in the history of our country.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we are seeing the response we fully expected. Economic growth has topped 3 percent for two quarters in a row. GDP growth, which is way ahead of schedule under my administration, will be one of America’s truly greatest weapons. Optimism has surged. Confidence has returned. With this new confidence, we are also bringing back clarity to our thinking. We are reasserting these fundamental truths: A nation without borders is not a nation.  A nation that does not protect prosperity at home cannot protect its interests abroad. A nation that is not prepared to win a war is a nation not capable of preventing a war. A nation that is not proud of its history cannot be confident in its future. And a nation that is not certain of its values cannot summon the will to defend them. Today, grounded in these truths, we are presenting to the world our new National Security Strategy. Based on my direction, this document has been in development for over a year. It has the endorsement of my entire Cabinet. Our new strategy is based on a principled realism, guided by our vital national interests, and rooted in our timeless values. This strategy recognizes that, whether we like it or not, we are engaged in a new era of competition. We accept that vigorous military, economic, and political contests are now playing out all around the world. We face rogue regimes that threaten the United States and our allies. We face terrorist organizations, transnational criminal networks, and others who spread violence and evil around the globe. We also face rival powers, Russia and China, that seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth. We will attempt to build a great partnership with those and other countries, but in a manner that always protects our national interest. As an example, yesterday I received a call from President Putin of Russia thanking our country for the intelligence that our CIA was able to provide them concerning a major terrorist attack planned in St. Petersburg, where many people, perhaps in the thousands, could have been killed. They were able to apprehend these terrorists before the event, with no loss of life. And that’s a great thing, and the way it’s supposed to work. That is the way it’s supposed to work. But while we seek such opportunities of cooperation, we will stand up for ourselves, and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We know that American success is not a forgone conclusion. It must be earned and it must be won. Our rivals are tough, they’re tenacious, and committed to the long term. But so are we. To succeed, we must integrate every dimension of our national strength, and we must compete with every instrument of our national power. Under the Trump administration, America is gaining wealth, leading to enhanced power—faster than anyone thought—with $6 trillion more in the stock market alone since the election—$6 trillion. With the strategy I am announcing today, we are declaring that America is in the game and America is going to win.  Thank you. Our strategy advances four vital national interests. First, we must protect the American people, the homeland, and our great American way of life. This strategy recognizes that we cannot secure our nation if we do not secure our borders. So for the first time ever, American strategy now includes a serious plan to defend our homeland. It calls for the construction of a wall on our southern border; ending chain migration and the horrible visa and lottery programs; closing loopholes that undermine enforcement; and strongly supporting our Border Patrol agents, ICE officers, and Homeland Security personnel.  In addition, our strategy calls for us to confront, discredit, and defeat radical Islamic terrorism and ideology and to prevent it from spreading into the United States. And we will develop new ways to counter those who use new domains, such as cyber and social media, to attack our nation or threaten our society. The second pillar of our strategy is to promote American prosperity. For the first time, American strategy recognizes that economic security is national security. Economic vitality, growth, and prosperity at home is absolutely necessary for American power and influence abroad. Any nation that trades away its prosperity for security will end up losing both. That is why this National Security Strategy emphasizes, more than any before, the critical steps we must take to ensure the prosperity of our nation for a long, long time to come. It calls for cutting taxes and rolling back unnecessary regulations. It calls for trade based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. It calls for firm action against unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. And it calls for new steps to protect our national security industrial and innovation base. The strategy proposes a complete rebuilding of American infrastructure—our roads, bridges, airports, waterways, and communications infrastructure. And it embraces a future of American energy dominance and self-sufficiency. The third pillar of our strategy is to preserve peace through strength.  We recognize that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unrivaled power is the most certain means of defense. For this reason, our strategy breaks from the damaging defense sequester. We’re going to get rid of that.  It calls for a total modernization of our military, and reversing previous decisions to shrink our armed forces—even as threats to national security grew. It calls for streamlining acquisition, eliminating bloated bureaucracy, and massively building up our military, which has the fundamental side benefit of creating millions and millions of jobs. This strategy includes plans to counter modern threats, such as cyber and electromagnetic attacks. It recognizes space as a competitive domain and calls for multi-layered missile defense.  This strategy outlines important steps to address new forms of conflict such as economic and political aggression. And our strategy emphasizes strengthening alliances to cope with these threats. It recognizes that our strength is magnified by allies who share principles—and our principles—and shoulder their fair share of responsibility for our common security. Fourth and finally, our strategy is to advance American influence in the world, but this begins with building up our wealth and power at home. America will lead again. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but we will champion the values without apology. We want strong alliances and partnerships based on cooperation and reciprocity. We will make new partnerships with those who share our goals, and make common interests into a common cause. We will not allow inflexible ideology to become an obsolete and obstacle to peace. We will pursue the vision we have carried around the world over this past year—a vision of strong, sovereign, and independent nations that respect their citizens and respect their neighbors; nations that thrive in commerce and cooperation, rooted in their histories and branching out toward their destinies. That is the future we wish for this world, and that is the future we seek in America.  With this strategy, we are calling for a great reawakening of America, a resurgence of confidence, and a rebirth of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. And we are returning to the wisdom of our founders. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. What we have built here in America is precious and unique. In all of history, never before has freedom reigned, the rule of law prevailed, and the people thrived as we have here for nearly 250 years. We must love and defend it. We must guard it with vigilance and spirit, and, if necessary, like so many before us, with our very lives. And we declare that our will is renewed, our future is regained, and our dreams are restored. Every American has a role to play in this grand national effort. And today, I invite every citizen to take their part in our vital mission. Together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate American greatness as a shining example to the world. As long as we are proud—and very proud—of who we are, how we got here, and what we are fighting for to preserve, we will not fail. If we do all of this, if we rediscover our resolve and commit ourselves to compete and win again, then together we will leave our children and our grandchildren a nation that is stronger, better, freer, prouder, and, yes, an America that is greater than ever before. God Bless You. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you, Klaus, very much. It’s a privilege to be here at this forum where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy, and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security, and peace. I’m here today to represent the interests of the American people and to affirm America’s friendship and partnership in building a better world. Like all nations represented at this great forum, America hopes for a future in which everyone can prosper, and every child can grow up free from violence, poverty, and fear. Over the past year, we have made extraordinary strides in the U.S. We’re lifting up forgotten communities, creating exciting new opportunities, and helping every American find their path to the American Dream—the dream of a great job, a safe home, and a better life for their children. After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election. Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades. Since my election, we’ve created 2.4 million jobs, and that number is going up very, very substantially. Small-business optimism is at an all-time high. New unemployment claims are near the lowest we’ve seen in almost half a century. African American unemployment has reached the lowest rate ever recorded in the United States, and so has unemployment among Hispanic Americans. The world is witnessing the resurgence of a strong and prosperous America. I’m here to deliver a simple message: There has never been a better time to hire, to build, to invest, and to grow in the United States. America is open for business, and we are competitive once again. The American economy is by far the largest in the world, and we’ve just enacted the most significant tax cuts and reform in American history. We’ve massively cut taxes for the middle class and small businesses to let working families keep more of their hard-earned money. We lowered our corporate tax rate from 35 percent, all the way down to 21 percent. As a result, millions of workers have received tax cut bonuses from their employers in amounts as large as $3,000. The tax cut bill is expected to raise the average American’s household income by more than $4,000. The world’s largest company, Apple, announced plans to bring $245 billion in overseas profits home to America. Their total investment into the United States economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years. Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs, and your investments to the United States. This is especially true because we have undertaken the most extensive regulatory reduction ever conceived. Regulation is stealth taxation. The U.S., like many other countries, unelected bureaucrats—and we have—believe me, we have them all over the place—and they’ve imposed crushing and anti-business and anti-worker regulations on our citizens with no vote, no legislative debate, and no real accountability. In America, those days are over. I pledged to eliminate two unnecessary regulations for every one new regulation. We have succeeded beyond our highest expectations. Instead of 2 for 1, we have cut 22 burdensome regulations for every 1 new rule. We are freeing our businesses and workers so they can thrive and flourish as never before. We are creating an environment that attracts capital, invites investment, and rewards production. America is the place to do business. So come to America, where you can innovate, create, and build. I believe in America. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like the leaders of other countries should put their country first also. But America first does not mean America alone. When the United States grows, so does the world. American prosperity has created countless jobs all around the globe, and the drive for excellence, creativity, and innovation in the U.S. has led to important discoveries that help people everywhere live more prosperous and far healthier lives. As the United States pursues domestic reforms to unleash jobs and growth, we are also working to reform the international trading system so that it promotes broadly shared prosperity and rewards to those who play by the rules. We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others. We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and it needs to be reciprocal. Because, in the end, unfair trade undermines us all. The United States will no longer turn a blind eye to unfair economic practices, including massive intellectual property theft, industrial subsidies, and pervasive state-led economic planning. These and other predatory behaviors are distorting the global markets and harming businesses and workers, not just in the U.S., but around the globe. Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of our country, our companies, and our workers. We will enforce our trade laws and restore integrity to our trading system. Only by insisting on fair and reciprocal trade can we create a system that works not just for the U.S. but for all nations. As I have said, the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries. This will include the countries in TPP, which are very important. We have agreements with several of them already. We would consider negotiating with the rest, either individually, or perhaps as a group, if it is in the interests of all. My administration is also taking swift action in other ways to restore American confidence and independence. We are lifting self-imposed restrictions on energy production to provide affordable power to our citizens and businesses, and to promote energy security for our friends all around the world. No country should be held hostage to a single provider of energy. America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America. We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive. We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace. We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable. And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly. We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world. Energy is abundant and affordable. There has never been a better time to come to America. We are also making historic investments in the American military because we cannot have prosperity without security. To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations. Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share. My administration is proud to have led historic efforts, at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world, to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke the Korean Peninsula. We continue to call on partners to confront Iran’s support for terrorists and block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon. We’re also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so. The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology. I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria. There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains. We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations. I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts. You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people. When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation. We will defend our citizens and our borders. We are also securing our immigration system, as a matter of both national and economic security. America is a cutting-edge economy, but our immigration system is stuck in the past. We must replace our current system of extended-family chain migration with a merit-based system of admissions that selects new arrivals based on their ability to contribute to our economy, to support themselves financially, and to strengthen our country. In rebuilding America, we are also fully committed to developing our workforce. We are lifting people from dependence to independence, because we know the single best anti-poverty program is a very simple and very beautiful paycheck. To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy. We must invest in our people. When people are forgotten, the world becomes fractured.  Only by hearing and responding to the voices of the forgotten can we create a bright future that is truly shared by all. The nation’s greatness is more than the sum of its production. A nation’s greatness is the sum of its citizens: the values, pride, love, devotion, and character of the people who call that nation home. From my first international G7 Summit, to the G20, to the U.N. General Assembly, to APEC, to the World Trade Organization, and today at the World Economic Forum, my administration has not only been present, but has driven our message that we are all stronger when free, sovereign nations cooperate toward shared goals and they cooperate toward shared dreams. Represented in this room are some of the remarkable citizens from all over the world. You are national leaders, business titans, industry giants, and many of the brightest minds in many fields. Each of you has the power to change hearts, transform lives, and shape your countries’ destinies. With this power comes an obligation, however —a duty of loyalty to the people, workers, and customers who have made you who you are. So together, let us resolve to use our power, our resources, and our voices, not just for ourselves, but for our people —to lift their burdens, to raise their hopes, and to empower their dreams; to protect their families, their communities, their histories, and their futures. That’s what we’re doing in America, and the results are totally unmistakable. It’s why new businesses and investment are flooding in.  It’s why our unemployment rate is the lowest it’s been in so many decades. It’s why America’s future has never been brighter. Today, I am inviting all of you to become part of this incredible future we are building together. Thank you to our hosts, thank you to the leaders and innovators in the audience. But most importantly, thank you to all of the hardworking men and women who do their duty each and every day, making this a better world for everyone. Together, let us send our love and our gratitude to make them, because they really make our countries run. They make our countries great. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Well, first of all, Klaus, I want to congratulate you. This is an incredible group of people. We had dinner last night with about 15 leaders of industry, none of whom I knew, but all of whom I’ve read about for years. And it was truly an incredible group. But I think I have 15 new friends. So this has been really great what you’ve done and putting it together, the economic forum. The tax reform was a dream of a lot of people over many years, but they weren’t able to get it done. Many people tried, and Ronald Reagan was really the last to make a meaningful cut and reform. And ours is cutting and reforming. We emphasize cut, but the reform is probably almost as important. We’ve wanted to do it. It is very tough, politically, to do it. Hard to believe that would be, but it is very, very tough. That’s why it hasn’t been done in close to 40 years. And once we got it going, it was going. And the big—and I wouldn’t say a total surprise, but one of the big things that happened and took place is AT&T and some others came out very early and they said they were going to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to people that work for their companies. And you have 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 people working for these companies, and all of a sudden it became like a big waterfall, a big, beautiful waterfall where so many companies are doing it. And even today they just announced many more. But every day they announce more and more. And now it’s a fight for who’s going to give the most. It started at 1,000, and now we have them up to 3,000. This is something that we didn’t anticipate. Oftentimes in business, things happen that you don’t anticipate. Usually that’s a bad thing, but this was a good thing. This came out of nowhere. Nobody ever thought of this as a possibility even. It wasn’t in the equation. We waited—we said, wait until February 1st when the checks start coming in. And people, Klaus, have a lot more money in their paycheck—because it’s not just a little money, this is a lot of money for people making a living doing whatever they may be doing. And we really though February 1st it was going to kick in and everybody was going to be—well, we haven’t even gotten there yet and it’s kicked in. And it’s had an incredible impact on the stock market and the stock prices. We’ve set 84 records since my election—record stock market prices, meaning we hit new highs 84 different times out of a one-year period. And that’s a great thing. And in all fairness, that was done before we passed the tax cuts and tax reform. So what happened is really something special. Then, as you know, and as I just said, Apple came in with $350 billion. And I tell you, I spoke with Tim Cook; I said, Tim, I will never consider this whole great run that we’ve made complete until you start building plants in the U.S. And I will tell you, this moved up very substantially. But when I heard 350, I thought he was talking—I thought they were talking $350 million. And, by the way, that’s a nice-sized plant. Not the greatest, but not bad. And they said, “No, sir. It’s $350 billion.” I said, that is something. Well, we have tremendous amounts of money, including my newfound friends from last night —great companies. They’re all investing. When one of the gentlemen said he’s putting in $2 billion because of the tax cuts, I said to myself, “Wow, he’s actually the cheap one in the group” —because they’re putting in massive numbers of billions of dollars. So I think you have a brand-new United States. You have a United States where people from all over the world are looking to come in and invest, and there’s just nothing like what’s happening. And I just want to finish by —I have a group of people that have been so —I have a whole lot of them, so I won’t introduce because then I’ll insult at least half of them. But I’ve had a group of people that worked so hard on this and other things. And we’re really doing —we had a great first year —so successful in so many different ways. And there’s a tremendous spirit. When you look at all of the different charts and polls, and you see, as an example, African American unemployment at the historic low—it’s never had a period of time like this. Same with Hispanic. Women at a 17-year low. It’s very heartwarming to see. But there’s a tremendous spirit in the United States. I would say it’s a spirit like I have never witnessed before. I’ve been here for awhile. I have never witnessed the spirit that our country has right now. So I just want to thank you all, and all those that are pouring billions of dollars into our country, or ten dollars into our country, we thank you very much. Thank you.  Sounds very interesting.  I didn’t know about this one.  Yes.  Good, I would like to do that. That’s very nice.  Steven, Wilbur, Gary, Robert, even my General and my various other generals, you know. We’re making our military protection a little bit better for us too. So thank you very much. Does everybody understand that? I think so. Thank you all for being here.  Well, being a businessman has been a great experience for me. I’ve loved it. I’ve always loved business. I’ve always been good at building things, and I’ve always been successful at making money. I’d buy things that would fail—that would be failures—and I’d turn them around and try and get them for the right price, and then I’d turn them around and make them successful. And I’ve been good at it. And that takes a certain ability. And, you know, historically, I guess, there’s never really been a businessman or businessperson elected president. It’s always been a general or a politician. Throughout history, it’s always been a general —you had to be a general —but mostly it was politicians. You never have a businessman. And then, in all fairness, I was saying to Klaus last night: Had the opposing party to me won—some of whom you backed, some of the people in the room—instead of being up almost 50 percent—the stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent—rather than that, I believe the stock market from that level, the initial level, would have been down close to 50 percent. That’s where we were heading. I really believe that—because they were going to put on massive new regulations. You couldn’t breathe. It was choking our country to death. And I was able to see that, Klaus, as a businessperson. The other thing is, I’ve always seemed to get, for whatever reason, a disproportionate amount of press or media.  Throughout my whole life—somebody will explain someday why—but I’ve always gotten a lot.  And as businessman I was always treated really well by the press. The numbers speak and things happen, but I’ve always really had a very good press. And it wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be. As the cameras start going off in the background.  But overall—I mean, the bottom line—somebody said, well, they couldn’t have been that bad because here we are—we’re president. And I think we’re doing a really great job with my team. I have a team of just tremendous people, and I think we’re doing a very special job. And I really believe it was time, and it was time to do that job, because I don’t think the United States would have done very well if it went through four or eight more years of regulation and, really, a very anti-business group of people. We have a very pro-business group. We have regulations cut to a level—in the history of our country, Klaus—this was reported recently. In one year we’ve cut more regulations in my administration than any other administration in four, eight, or sixteen years, in the one case. We’ve cut more regulations in one year, and we have a ways to go. I mean, we’re probably 50 percent done. And we’re going to have regulation. There’s nothing wrong with rules and regulations; you need them. But we’ve cut more than any administration ever in the history of our country, and we still have a ways to go. So I think between that and the tremendous tax cuts, we’ve really done something. And one other thing I said—and I saw it last night with some of the leaders and the businesspeople—I think I’ve been a cheerleader for our country, and everybody representing a company or a country has to be a cheerleader, or no matter what you do, it’s just not going to work. And the reason I’m a cheerleader is because it’s easy—because I love our country and I think we’re just doing really well. And we look forward to seeing you in America—special place—and where you are is a special place also. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.   Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you."
"Thank you, Paul and Mitch, for the introduction and for your tremendous leadership. You folks have done well. I just looked at some numbers. You’ve even done better than you thought, I think—( )—based on what we just saw about 10 minutes ago. And I want to thank you, to the Governor of this incredible state, my very good friend, Jim Justice and his wonderful wife, Cathy, who are with us. And Jim is now a proud member of the Republican Party. He was a Democrat. He switched over, right?  You don’t see that too often. Maybe we’ll see it more and more. But thank you, Jim. And the hotel is beautiful, and everything is beautiful. We appreciate it. It’s great to be among so many friends for the second time this week. Tuesday was an incredible evening, as we were all inspired.  And I really mean that. We were inspired by America’s heroes and uplifted by everyone who has sacrificed in the fight for freedom. They were, and are, incredible people that we saw that night, and tremendous courage. And one of the people, I have to say—boy, you got a very big hand, Steve. Steve Scalise. A great hand.  And we’re all truly blessed to be Americans. Before going any further, I want to send our prayers to everyone affected by the train accident yesterday, and especially to the family of the person who was so tragically killed. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And thank you. With us today on stage is our incredible leadership team. And they really have—if you look—you just look at what’s happened in the last short period of time. Without them, I could have never won the Presidency, I guess. I don’t know, could I have won the Presidency without them?  Huh? Steve, yes, right?  I don’t know. But they’ve become very good friends, and we’re now in battle together and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.  Thank you, Mitch. Great guy.  That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job.  House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Again, Steve, thank you.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin.  Chair John Thune and House Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  Did they forget your name, John? I don’t know. What’s going on here?  John Cornyn, everybody knows. They didn’t put his name up, but that’s okay. That’s the first time that’s ever happened. Hey, John, that will never happen again.  Working together, we’ve accomplished extraordinary things for the American people over the last year, and I really believe this is just the beginning. You know, Paul Ryan called me the other day, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, but I will say that he said to me, he has never, ever seen the Republican Party so united, so much in like with each other. But, literally, the word “united” was the word he used. It’s the most united he’s ever seen the party, and I see it too. I have so many friends in this group, and there is a great coming together that I don’t think either party has seen for many, many years. So—right?  That’s good.  I was hoping he wouldn’t deny that.  But he did—he called me, and I thought it was very nice. So thank you, Paul, very much. Every day, we’re removing government burdens and empowering our citizens to follow their hearts and live out their dreams. The priorities of Republicans in Congress are the priorities of the American people. We believe in strong families, and we believe in strong borders.  We believe in the rule of law, and we support the men and women of law enforcement.  We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job. And we know that, for Americans, nothing—absolutely nothing—is out of reach because we don’t know the meaning of the word “quit.” We don’t quit. And the Republican Party certainly hasn’t quit—because if we did, we wouldn’t be here today. We’d be sitting home saying, “Boy, that was a tough year,” instead of, “That was one of the greatest years in the history of politics, in the history of our country for a party—what we’ve done and what we’ve accomplished.” I don’t think it’s been done, and certainly not by much. We had a year that was almost, I would think, unlike any. It was a tremendous success, and I give everybody in this room the credit. And I give, certainly, these people behind me tremendous credit for what took place, especially in that last month. That was a month of tremendous pressure, and that was people that were able to act under pressure. My favorite type of person. They were able to act under tremendous pressure. So I just want to thank you all, because that’s what it was all about. And, you know, it was interesting—while we had a great year, we weren’t being given credit for it—regulations at a level that nobody has ever done. In one year, we knocked out more regulations than anybody. Supreme Court justice, judges, all over. So many different records. So many successes. But when we got the great tax cut bill—and we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill—we got that, it was like putting it all in a box and wrapping it with a beautiful ribbon. We started getting credit not only for that, but for all of the other things that we did during the year. It’s amazing the way that happened. I was surprised, actually. But we got a lot of credit from a lot of people. And all of a sudden, they’re saying, “While we had a lot of accomplishment”—and then they went on to do the thing. But the fact is—( )—you understand that. But we really did. We got a lot of credit. It all came together in that final month. And so I give everybody in this room, really, kudos. We’re a nation of builders and dreamers and strivers and fighters. And together, we’re building a safe, strong, and very proud America, already, since the election. We’ve created 2.4 million jobs. That’s unthinkable.  And that doesn’t include all of the things that are happening. You’re going to see numbers that get even better. The stock market has added more than $8 trillion in new wealth. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, which is something. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. African American and Hispanic unemployment have both reached the lowest levels ever recorded. That’s something very, very special.  And when I made that statement the other night, there was zero movement from the Democrats. They sat there, stone cold, no smile, no  . You would have thought that, on that one, they would have, sort of, at least clapped a little bit. Which tells you, perhaps, they’d rather see us not do well than see our country do great. And that’s not good. That’s not good. We have to change that.  And as I said, we’ve eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or, in one instance, sixteen years. In one year, we’ve knocked out more regulations. It’s an amazing thing. And I happen to think that that is every bit as important toward our success as the tax cuts. I have many business friends and many people in business that came to me and they say that—including small businesses—they say the fact that they no longer have to go through years of turmoil in getting approved and getting approvals, and getting rule changes and getting all sorts of things, and getting old while they’re waiting to get them—the fact that all of that is gone is probably as important or even more important to the massive tax cuts we’ve gotten people. So that’s something. We’ve signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And I have to say, included in there is the individual mandate. We repealed it. That’s a big one.  That’s so big. By itself, that would be a big achievement. And we, sort of, take it as, well, that was included. And ANWR, one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world.  And I never appreciated ANWR so much. A friend of mine called up, who’s in that world and in that business, and said, “Is it true that you’re thinking about ANWR?” I said, “Yeah, I think we’re going to get it, but you know.” He said, “Are you kidding? That’s the biggest thing, by itself.” He said, “Ronald Reagan and every President has wanted to get ANWR approved.” And after that, I said, “Oh, make sure that’s in the bill.”  It was amazing how that had an impact. That had a very big impact on me, Paul. I really didn’t care about it, and then when I heard that everybody wanted it—for 40 years, they’ve been trying to get it approved, and I said, “Make sure you don’t lose ANWR.”  But it’s great for the people of Alaska. And Senator Sullivan and Senator Murkowski are here someplace. Where are they? But they are very happy campers. Senator?  Good, Senator. Thank you. They worked very—  Where’s Don Young? He’s such a quiet guy. Where Is Don?  Don Young, also. Don, thank you.  So—no, we were always going to get it. We never had a problem with it. But if you think about, that by itself is a big bill. The individual mandate by itself is a big, powerful bill. That was just added on to what we did with the massive tax cuts. I want to thank Senate Finance Chairman—and a very spectacular man—Orrin Hatch.  Where’s Orrin? Orrin. Orrin is—I love listening to him speak. He said once, I am the single greatest President in his lifetime. Now, he’s a young man, so it’s not that much, but—( ). And he actually once said I’m the greatest President in the history of our country. And I said, “Does that include Lincoln and Washington?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “I love this guy.”  I love him. But he is, he’s a special guy. And House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady for their incredible work.  Kevin? Where are you, Kevin? That’s—what a job. I’d call Kevin night after night. “Kevin, what about this? What about that?” You were always there. He was working. What did you average sleep for about four weeks? About—maybe nothing? I think he had no average. But you did a great job. Nobody knows it better than you, Kevin. Thank you. Maybe we’ll do a phase two, I don’t know. We’ll do a phase two. Are you ready for that, Kevin? Huh? I think you’re ready.  We’ll get them even lower. But we are proud of you. Here in West Virginia, as a result of our tax cuts, the typical family of four will save roughly $2,000 a year. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. And when I came into this beautiful building just a little while ago, one of the people said, “You know, I just got a check, and I have $221 more than I had last year at this time in my envelope.”  And that one—really, that’s what we were waiting. We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody that Nancy Pelosi called “crumbs.” That was a bad—that could be like “deplorable.” Does that make sense? “Deplorable” and “crumbs”—those two words, they seem to have a resemblance. I hope it has the same meaning. But she called it crumbs, when people are getting $2,000 and $3,000 and $1,000. That’s not crumbs. That’s a lot of money. We also doubled the child tax credit, and that’s so helpful to so many. We’ve gone from one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, to one of the most competitive—one of the lower ones—so that our great workers and companies can compete and win against anyone. We’ve now given them the tools to go out and win. And that’s what they’re doing. And they’re also pouring back. A lot of you folks, you saw Davos the other day, they’re coming back. I believe I brought hundreds of billions of dollars with me back from Europe, back from Switzerland, when I went there the other day to make a speech. They’re so excited about this country and what’s happening here. And they would never, ever have come. In fact, if the opposing party had won the election, you would have had tremendous new rules and regulations put on everything, and other things would have happened. And instead of going up almost 50 percent, your stock market, in my opinion, would have gone down 50 percent—I really believe that—because they were stifling it. They were getting prepared to stifle even worse than it was. The changes to our business tax alone are expected to raise average household income by $4,000. Roughly 3 million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker—and that’s just over the past six weeks alone. Because of our tax cuts, Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States. They’re bringing $240 billion back—$240 billion. They’re going to pay a tax of $38 billion, Mitch—$38 billion. But they’re going to invest a total of $350 billion. And when I first heard the number, I said, “You don’t mean billion, you mean $350 million.” Because I’ve been saying to Tim Cook, “Tim, we got to build plants here.” You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they’re going to build a lot of plants. And this would have never happened without us and the work you’ve done. And they’re hiring 20,000 workers, by the way.  And two days ago, ExxonMobil, in addition to many others, just announced that they are investing $50 billion in the United States. So the good news just keeps on rolling in, and it’s going to. And I want to thank Senator Tim Scott for “opportunity zones.” Our tax plan encourages this investment. Where is Tim? What a good guy Tim is.  Tim. See him over there someplace? Thank you, Tim. But we’re investing in distressed communities to create more jobs for those who have too often been left behind. And Tim worked hard on that. We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job really well done. And we’re reaching our hand all across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reforms for the good of all Americans. All Americans. We can reform our prison system to help those who have served their time get a second chance at life. And I’ve watched this, and I’ve seen it, and I’ve studied it. And people get out of prison, and they made a mistake. And not all—some are very bad, but many are very good. And they come home and they can’t get a job. It’s sad. They can’t—there’s—they can’t get a job. Now, the best thing we’ve done to fix that, Paul, is the fact that the economy is just booming. I mean, that fixes it better than any program we can do, anything we can do at all. But the economy is so strong now and so good, and so many companies are moving in that I really believe that problem—it’s a big problem—is going to solve itself. But we’re working on it. We can invest in workforce development, job training, and open new vocational schools, because we want every American to be able to reach their full God-given potential. Vocational schools—today you have community colleges and you have all of the—when I was growing up, we had vocational schools. And when I was going to school, I remember I was in high school, and there were people in class—one person in particular, he wasn’t, like, the greatest student. And—he just wasn’t. And yet, I saw him one day, and he was able to fix a car engine, blindfolded. And everybody else was saying that’s amazing how talented he is. He had a different kind of a talent. And we should have vocational schools. You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry, and all of these things. We don’t have that very much anymore. And I think the word “vocational” is a much better word than, in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don’t know what a community college means or represents. So we’re working very hard on vocational schools so that when all these companies move into this country, we’re going to have a workforce that knows exactly what they’re doing. In addition to that, when they move in, we’re giving them incentives to also train people themselves. Because, in many ways, that’s the best way to do it. In Wisconsin, we have a great company moving in. They make all of the Apple iPhones, and they’re going to have a big program. They’re going to have a tremendous program to teach people how to do this, because it’s a whole new skill. And it will be very successful. We can reduce the price of prescription drugs and ensure that terminally ill patients have a right to try.  So important—right to try. You know, those drugs, they sit in there for 12, 13, 14 years. And a person is terminally ill, they have two months left, and under the old system they don’t want to give them even an experimental medicine because they’re afraid they’re going to be hurt. Well, they’re not going to be around for two months. So they’ll sign a waiver, and we’re going to give them the hope of finding something. You have people—and I’ve known people like this—they travel all over the world to try and find a cure. And we have great experimental drugs, but it will be years before they come on to the market. So it’s called Right to Try, and I hope you folks can approve it, and I hope you agree with it. But I think it’s so important. It’s so important.  And Scott Gottlieb is heading it up. And it’s—and the other thing you get is you learn pretty quickly how effective it is; does it work. But you learn it really, very quickly. So, Right to Try. We can fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones that are fair. And the most important word to me, on trade, is “reciprocal.” Because we have deals where companies will send in a motorbike, and we charge them nothing. But when we send a Harley-Davidson or a motorbike to those countries, they charge us 100 percent tax. That’s not fair. So they’ll send their motorbikes, or something, into us—zero. We send it to them—100 percent. That’s not fair trade. That’s not fair. So I like the word “reciprocal.” If they’re going to do it to us, we’re going to do it to them. And what’s going to happen is your numbers are going to either come down, or we’re going to make a lot of money. And either one is okay, as far as I’m concerned. We can rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and we will; streamline the horrible approval process—roadways that take 12, 13, 14 years to get approved. We used to build them in three months, and now it takes years and years of approvals. We’re going to bring that down, ideally, to one year. Two years is our goal, but one year is our real goal. And we can get it done under budget, and we want to get it done ahead of schedule. Because you don’t have too many of them. Under budget and ahead of schedule. We can deliver for our police, our veterans, and our brave servicemembers. And finally, after decades of waiting, we can finally pass immigration reform that protects our country, defends our borders, and modernizes our immigration rules to serve the needs of American workers and of American families. So important. One of the strengths of the Republican Party is that we’re a big tent with many diverse views, but the one thing we can all agree on—and that’s that, in every decision, we make our highest priority to serve and to protect the American people. We want an immigration policy that’s fair, equitable, but that’s going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, and they respect our people and our country. We don’t want visa lottery. Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery. We don’t want that. So we want it based on merit.  We have a chance now to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of you have been working on for your entire careers. We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We’re getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we’re going to get a call from these people saying, “Let’s go.” You know, they talk a good game. We have to get help from the other side, or we have to elect many more Republicans. That’s another way of doing it.  Really, that’s another way of doing it. And based on the numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that. You know, ’18 is going to be very interesting. But we’ve got to do one or the other. Either they’re going to have to come on board—because they talk a good game with DACA, but they don’t produce. And so either they come on board, or we’re just going to have to really work and we’re going to have to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass, in a much easier fashion, legislation. And to get it done, we’ll all have to make some compromises along the way—to get it done this way. Now, to get it done the other way, if we win more, we don’t have to compromise so much. Okay? With the tax bill, we got what we wanted because we had, essentially, a unanimous vote. But we have to go, and we have to get it done and get it done properly, and we’re going to have to compromise—unless we elect more Republicans, in which case, we can have it just the way everybody in this room wants it. We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot. If we’re united, if we work together for the good of the nation, and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voters, we have really fulfilled a solemn promise. As you know, I have put forward an immigration framework based on many months of meeting and working with Tom Cotton, and working with John Cornyn, who was in the office the other day, and David Perdue—incredible people—and Bob Goodlatte, who’s out here someplace. Really incredible people. And it’s a strong bill, but it’s a very fair bill. And it protects our border. We have to protect our borders.  It includes reforms that are overwhelmingly popular with the voters, including Democrats. The Democrats want to have—the real Democrats, they want to have their borders protected. But it includes Democrats, independents, Republicans. Americans want an immigration system that works for everybody. And they want safety. And, by the way, they also want a strong military. And we have to be very powerful on our military. You know, our military has been depleted over the last long period of time, even beyond Obama. It’s been depleted. We’ve got to build up. This should not be a party thing; this should be common sense. Without our military, we might not be here talking. We have to have a strong military. And I think we’re very much on our way. From the one standpoint, we’re going for funding, which we need, and I think we’ll get it. But we have a lot of fighting on that from the other side, and we can’t even think about it. We need a strong and powerful military. And we’re going to have far more powerful than we were ever before.  Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on DACA. And I’ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It’s not DREAMers. Don’t fall into that trap. It’s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can’t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here.  But DACA—we want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don’t think they do. But we’re going to find out very soon. We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery.  And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework—a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century. The Republican position on immigration is the center, mainstream view of the American people, with some extra strength at the border and security at the border added in. What we’re asking for and what the American people are pleading for is sanity and common sense in our immigration system. We want immigration rules that protect our communities, defend our security, and admit people who will love our country and contribute to our society. I know that the Senate is planning to bring an immigration bill on the floor, to the floor, in coming weeks. And I’m asking that the framework we submitted—with great flexibility, great flexibility, working with both parties—that something very positive will come out of it for our country, for everybody—for our country. And I think that can happen. If the Democrats choose to filibuster a framework that includes a generous path to citizenship or something that is not fair, we are not going to approve it. We’re just not going to approve it. So we’ll either have something that’s fair and equitable and good and secure, or we’re going to have nothing at all. And this has been going on for many years. It doesn’t make sense, however, to have nothing at all, because this is something that people want. So we will be demonstrating that we are very, very serious. One of the reasons I gave a number that was, I thought, a very generous number was because I wanted to see whether or not they were interested in approving that. Because if they don’t approve something within that sphere, that means, very simply, that they’re not looking to approve it at all. They want to use it for an election issue, but it’s now an election issue that will go to our benefit, not their benefit.  But make no mistake: I will not rest until we have delivered for the citizens of our great country so many different things—immigration, the strong military. We’ve done an awfully good job of protecting our Second Amendment. That was in question during the campaign, you remember, and we have done a very, very good job.  For the last 12 months, I have kept one promise after another, and we’re just getting started. So often I’ll see—and I must say, six, seven months ago, they were saying, he didn’t fulfill his promise on this or that. I said, I’ve only been here for four months. You know, other people were there for eight years and they would finally get something passed. I was there four months—you know this, Paul—and they were saying, “He didn’t fulfill a promise.” But now we’ve fulfilled far more promises than we promised.  And they’re having a hard time with that. We have seriously fulfilled promises. I call it “promises plus.”  And one of the things we’re doing that’s so important—and Mitch has worked so hard on, and Don, and everybody—is the justices, the judges all over the country. We’re filling up the courts with really talented people who understand and read the Constitution for what it says.  So it’s really not talked about that much, but it is a tremendous impact. It’s having already a tremendous impact. And we have incredible people lined up—just lined up—that are getting ready to go into the courts. And, in many ways, Mitch, I think it’s going to be one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, that we’re doing. Defense is always the most. Got to be the most, John, right? But what we’re doing with the courts, I think, is going to go down as one of the greatest achievements, so I want to thank you for that. Thank you.  And not only are we protecting America at home, we’re protecting our interests abroad. It’s time to finally end the dangerous defense sequester. It would be wonderful if we could go back to a budget—( )—in order to fully fund our military, and do it properly and order properly, and have it over a period of time, and do it the right way. So at some point, I hope, we’re going to be able to do that and it should work. And in order to defeat terrorists, we’re also asking Congress to ensure that we continue to have all necessary power and everything we need to defeat and detain the terrorists. We can’t treat terrorists like common criminals; they are really unlawful enemy combatants.  When you see what they do and the way they do it, and the level of ferocity, we can’t treat them the way we do the ordinary criminal. And as you saw on Tuesday, I’ve signed an order keeping open our very secure detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay.  It’s another promise kept. And there is one more very important promise we’re keeping: No longer are we making apologies for America. We don’t apologize anymore.  We’re proud of our history, we’re confident in our values, and we’re grateful to our heroes, and we are determined to create a brighter future for all of our people. We are restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all, as friends, as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans. Because when Americans are united, nothing—nothing at all—nothing can stop us. We win.  As I said the other night, we are a nation that built the Empire State Building in one year. Actually, to be exact, it was—we built it in less than a year. Would you believe it? Working 24 hours around the clock. We built the Hoover Dam in record time. We built the Golden Gate Bridge. We linked our nation together with railroads and highways. We dug out the Panama Canal. We’re the nation that won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put satellites into space and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. We’ve healed the sick, cured disease, and cared for the poor like no other nation. We’ve lifted millions into prosperity, and delivered millions into freedom. This is our legacy. This is our birthright. And this is the foundation on which we build our very glorious future. Because together, we are, indeed, making America great again. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you very much.  Thank you."
"My fellow Americans, today I speak to a nation in grief. Yesterday, a school filled with innocent children and caring teachers became the scene of terrible violence, hatred, and evil. Around 2:30 yesterday afternoon, police responded to reports of gunfire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida—a great and safe community. There, a shooter, who is now in custody, opened fire on defenseless students and teachers. He murdered 17 people and badly wounded at least 14 others. Our entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families. To every parent, teacher, and child who is hurting so badly, we are here for you—whatever you need, whatever we can do, to ease your pain. We are all joined together as one American family, and your suffering is our burden also. No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school. No parent should ever have to fear for their sons and daughters when they kiss them goodbye in the morning. Each person who was stolen from us yesterday had a full life ahead of them—a life filled with wondrous beauty and unlimited potential and promise. Each one had dreams to pursue, love to give, and talents to share with the world. And each one had a family to whom they meant everything in the world. Today, we mourn for all of those who lost their lives. We comfort the grieving and the wounded. And we hurt for the entire community of Parkland, Florida that is now in shock, in pain, and searching for answers. To law enforcement, first responders, and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We thank you for your courage. Soon after the shooting, I spoke with Governor Scott to convey our deepest sympathies to the people of Florida and our determination to assist in any way that we can. I also spoke with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. I’m making plans to visit Parkland to meet with families and local officials, and to continue coordinating the federal response. In these moments of heartache and darkness, we hold on to God’s word in scripture: “I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you.” We trust in that promise, and we hold fast to our fellow Americans in their time of sorrow. I want to speak now directly to America’s children, especially those who feel lost, alone, confused or even scared: I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be. You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you. If you need help, turn to a teacher, a family member, a local police officer, or a faith leader. Answer hate with love; answer cruelty with kindness. We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors. Our administration is working closely with local authorities to investigate the shooting and learn everything we can. We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health. Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation’s governors and attorney generals, where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority. It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference. We must actually make that difference. In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil, and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. And so always, but especially today, let us hold our loved ones close, let us pray for healing and for peace, and let us come together as one nation to wipe away the tears and strive for a much better tomorrow. Thank you. And God Bless you all. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. Thank you everybody.  Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Matt, for that great introduction. And thank you for this big crowd. This is incredible. Really incredible.  We’ve all come a long way together. We’ve come a long way together. I’m thrilled to be back at CPAC, with so many of my wonderful friends and amazing supporters, and proud conservatives.  Remember when I first started running? Because I wasn’t a politician, fortunately. But do you remember I started running and people would say, “Are you sure he’s a conservative?” I think now we’ve proved that I’m a conservative, right?  For more than four decades, this event has served as a forum for our nation’s top leaders, activists, writers, thinkers. Year after year, leaders have stood on this stage to discuss what we can do together to protect our heritage, to promote our culture, and to defend our freedom. CPAC has always been about big ideas and it’s also been about putting those ideas into action. And CPAC really has put a lot of ideas into action. We’ll talk about some of them this morning. For the last year, with your help, we have put more great conservative ideas into use than perhaps ever before in American history.  Right? By the way, what a nice picture that is. Look at that. I’d love to watch that guy speak.  Oh, boy. That’s a—I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks. I work hard at it.  It doesn’t look bad. Hey, we’re hanging in. We’re hanging in. We’re hanging in there, right? Together, we’re hanging in. We’ve confirmed a record number—so important—of circuit court judges, and we are going to be putting in a lot more.  And they will interpret the law as written. And we’ve confirmed an incredible new Supreme Court justice, a great man, Neil Gorsuch.  Right? We’ve passed massive—biggest in history—tax cuts and reforms.  You know, I don’t use the word “reform.” There was a lot of reform, too. Very positive reform. I don’t use it. And when we were first doing it, I told everybody—everybody gathered—I said, “Just talk about tax cuts. People don’t know what reform means. They think reform might mean it’s going up.” And I said, “Do tax cuts.”  Thank you. How did he get in here, Matt? Boy. Okay. Just for the media, the fake news back there, they took very good care of him. They were very gentle.  He was very obnoxious. It was only one person. So we have thousands of people here.  So listen—tomorrow, the headline will be, “Protestors disturbed the Trump…”—one person, folks. Doesn’t deserve a mention. Doesn’t deserve a headline. The headline tomorrow: “Disrupters of CPAC.” One person. And he was very nice—we looked at him, and he immediately left. Okay. ( ) No, I’ve had it too often. You’ll have one person, and you can hardly even hear him. In fact, the biggest, really, disturbance are you people. You know why? He’ll say something; nobody hears him. Because it’s all—and then the crowd will start screaming at him. And then all of a sudden we stop for—and that’s okay. You have to show your spirit, right? You have to show your spirit. It’s true.  So we passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. And it was called “tax cut and reform.” And I said to our people, don’t use the word “reform.” Because we were going to call it the “Tax Reform Act.” I said, “No wonder for 45 years nothing has been passed.” Because people want tax cuts, and they don’t know what reform means. Reform can mean you’re going to pay more tax. So I convinced politicians who have done this all their lives—and they do a great job, in many cases—but this was one—they were going, the “Tax Reform Act” of whatever year we want to put. Okay? So they have the Tax Reform Act, and that was it. And now it was called the Tax Act—Tax Cut Act and Jobs. We had to add “jobs” into it because we’re picking up a tremendous number of jobs—2.7 million jobs since the election. 2.7.  So now people hear tax cuts, and it has been popular. Remember, it started off a little slow. Then it got passed, and we had some great help. I will say, we had some great help in the Senate, in the House. We have guys here today—we have a lot of congressmen, we have a lot of senators. We had a lot of help. And we got it passed. Just—it was not easy. We didn’t have one Democrat vote, and I think that’s going to cost them in the midterms. I know that whoever wins the presidency has a disadvantage, for whatever reason, in the midterms. You know what happens? I’m trying to figure it out. Because historically, if you win the presidency, you don’t do well two years later. And you know what? We can’t let that happen.  And I know what happens. I finally figured it out. Nobody has been able to explain it. It just happens, statistically, almost all of the time for many years. What happens is, you fight so hard to win the presidency. You fight, fight, fight. And now only two years—that’s a very short period. And by the time you start campaigning, it’s a year. And now you got to go and fight again. But you just won. So nobody has that same drive that they had. So you end up not doing that well because the other side is going—they’re crazed. And, by the way, they’re crazed anyway, these people. They are really crazed. ( ) Right? So—because I kept trying to say, “Why is this?” But it’s just there. So the great enthusiasm—you know, you’re sitting back, you’re watching television. “Maybe I don’t have to vote today; we just won the presidency.” And then we get clobbered, and we can’t let that happen. We get clobbered in ’18, and we can’t let that happen—only because we are so happy, we passed so many things. Honestly, and I’ll say—I’ll use the word “my administration” as opposed to me—my administration, I think, has had the most successful first year in the history of the presidency. I really believe that. I really believe it. I really believe it.  So, I mean, judges, regulations, everything. And the beautiful thing about the tax cuts is nobody thought we could do it. Because again, we had to get 100 percent of our vote. And nobody thought we could do it. And, frankly—I mean, to me we got it and it’s turned out to be one of the most popular things. And, by the way, for the Republicans in this room, of which I assume—would you say, is it 99 percent, Matt, or 100 percent? Huh? I would hope it’s close to—you know what, hey, we probably have some Democrats that want to come over. We have a great governor from West Virginia that left the Democratic Party—Big Jim—and he came over to the Republican Party.  So people are sitting there, and they’re saying, “Oh, we just had that great victory. Eh, let’s not vote. Let’s go to a movie. We’re the Republican Party, we’re going to do great.” And then they end up losing. So you got to keep up the enthusiasm. Now what happens, by the way, they lose. And then you have the presidential election coming up again, and you clobber them because everybody gets off their ass and they get out and they work. Right? And they work. And they work and work and work. And you end up winning the Presidency again. And we should do that—hopefully we’re going to do that very easily. But never—we have to worry—right now, we have a big race coming up in ’18. You have to get out. You have to just get that enthusiasm. Keep it going.  See, the word, really, is “complacent.” People get complacent. It’s a natural instinct. You just won, and now you’re happy and you’re complacent. Don’t be complacent. Okay? Don’t be complacent. Because if they get in, they will repeal your tax cuts, they will put judges in that you wouldn’t believe, they’ll take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen.  They’ll take away your Second Amendment. ( ).  Remember that. They will take away—thank you. They will take away those massive tax cuts and they will take away your Second Amendment. By the way, if you only had a choice of one, what would you rather have? The Second Amendment or the tax cuts? Go ahead, Second Amendment, tax cuts. Second Amendment.  I’m going to leave it at the Second Amendment. I don’t want to get into that battle, all right? We’re going to say you want—Matt, we’re going to say you want the Second Amendment the most. But we’re going to get them all. And remember this—( )—remember this: We’ve gotten—you know, somebody got on television recently and they said, actually, this is the first time I can remember—Trump made campaign promises. He may be the only person that actually fulfilled more promises than he made. I think that’s true.  I fulfilled more promises. But we have a very crooked media. We had a crooked candidate, too, by the way. But we have a very, very crooked media.  I will say this, folks: Everything that’s turning out, now it’s amazing that’s come full circle. Boy, have they committed a lot of atrocities when you look.  Right? When you look. Have they done things that are wrong. But remember this: Not only did we get the tax cuts, which everybody said we wouldn’t get—and, by the way, repealed, in that tax cut, the individual mandate, which is a tremendous thing.  This is where you’re forced to pay in order not to have healthcare. Okay? Is that great? You pay for the privilege of not having healthcare. So you’re subsidizing lots of other people. That’s gone. I know people came up to me with tears in their eyes; they’re saying, I’m forced to pay not to have healthcare. Very unfair. And, by the way, we’re having tremendous plans coming out now—healthcare plans—at a fraction of the cost that are much better than Obamacare.  And except for one Senator, who came into a room at 3 o’clock in the morning and went like that—we would have had healthcare, too.  We would have had healthcare, too. Think of that. But I think we may be better off the way we’re doing it. It’s piece by piece by piece. Obamacare is just being wiped out. The individual mandate, essentially, wipes it out.  So I think we may be better off. And people are getting great healthcare plans and we’re not finished yet. But, remember, one person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in, and he went this way, and everyone said, “What happened? What was that all about?” Boy, oh, boy. Who was that? I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t want to be controversial, so I won’t use his name. Okay?  What a mess. But it’s all happening anyway. It’s all happening anyway. And we’ve, at the same time, eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, and people are going back to work.  Right? People are going back to work. So—and you know, the fake news always—if I say something that’s like, a little off, next day headline, “He misrepresents…”—I have to be careful. But in the history of Presidents, no President—and I’m saying no President. Now, maybe they’ll find I was off by two but we’re here one year.  No President—well, I read it in lots of good papers, actually.  But they’ll change the story when I say it. No President has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term, okay—( )—as we’ve cut in less than a year.  And it’s my opinion that the regulations had as big an impact as these massive tax cuts that we’ve given. So I really believe it.  We’ve ended the war on American energy. We were in war. And we’ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal.  One of our great natural resources. And very important for our defense—coal—very important for our defense. Because we have it. We don’t have to send it through pipes. We don’t have to get it from foreign countries. We have more than anybody. And they wanted to end it. And our miners have been mistreated and they’re not being mistreated anymore. We’re doing tremendous business.  I was in Vietnam, and the Prime Minister and the President of Vietnam were there. And we have a massive deficit with them, like we do with everybody else because these Presidents have just let it go to hell. We have the worst trade deals you’ve ever seen. So we’re changing it. So I said, we have too big of a deficit with Vietnam; I’m not happy. He said, “Well, but we’re going to…” I said, “Buy coal. Buy coal.” They use a lot of coal. Buy coal. And he said, “You know, we have bought coal from West Virginia and other places, and it’s the finest coal we have ever used.” It’s interesting. And West Virginia now is doing great. You look at what’s happening in West Virginia. You look at what’s happening in Pennsylvania. You look at what’s happening in Ohio.  And you look at what’s happening in Wyoming. You look at what’s happening all over. It’s like a—it’s like a different world. And remember this: Virtually, as soon as I got into office, we approved the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipeline, which would never have been approved.  And we announced our withdrawal from the totally disastrous, job-killing, wealth-knocking-out—you know, it knocked out our wealth, or it would have. They basically wanted to take our wealth away. They didn’t want us to use our wealth power. We knocked out the Paris Climate Accord. Would have been a disaster.  Would have been a disaster for our country.  You know, basically, it said, you have a lot of oil and gas that we found—you know, technology has been amazing—and we found things that we never knew. But we have massive—just about the top in the world—we have massive energy reserves. We have coal. We have so much. And basically, they were saying, don’t use it, you can’t use it. So what it does is it makes us uncompetitive with other countries. It’s not going to happen. I told them, it’s not going to happen. And, you know, China, their agreement didn’t kick in until 2030. Right? Our agreement kicks in immediately. Russia, they’re allowed to go back into the 1990s, which was not a clean environmental time. Other countries, big countries—India and others—we had to pay, because they considered them a growing country. They were a growing country. I said, “What are we?” Are we allowed to grow too? Okay?  Now, are we allowed to grow?  They called India a “developing nation.” They called China a “developing nation.” But the United States, we’re developed—we can pay. So, folks, if you don’t mind—I’ll tell you what—it’s amazing how many people understood the Paris Accord, because it sounds so good. It’s like some of the environmental regulations that I cut—they have the most beautiful titles. And sometimes I’d say, “Look, I’m just going to close my eyes and sign this because, you know what, I’m going to get killed on this one.” And I get so much thanks. The country knows what I’m doing. We couldn’t build. We couldn’t farm. If you had a puddle on your land, they called it a lake for the purposes of environmentals.  I mean, it’s crazy. It’s crazy. And I’d sign certain bills and I’d have farmers behind me and I’d have house builders, home builders behind me. And these are tough people, strong people. They fought hard. They’ve worked all their lives, hard. And they’d be—half of them would be crying because we gave them their property back. We gave them the right to earn a living. They couldn’t do it. They couldn’t do what they had to do. We gave them their property back. We gave them their dignity back.  By the way, you don’t mind if I go off script a little bit because, you know, it’s sort of boring. It’s a little boring.  Got this beautiful speech, everything is wonderful but a little boring. We have to, you know — But we gave them their dignity back. And that’s why our country is doing record business. We’re doing record business. We’re doing business—and you have to look at the fundamentals. Companies are pouring back into this country. They’re pouring back. Not like — I mean, when did you hear about car companies coming back into Michigan and coming to Ohio and expanding?  When did you hear — you never heard that. You hear they’re leaving. I’ve been talking about it for 20 years. I was a private sector guy. But for whatever reason, I always had — these guys always covered me much more than anybody else. I always got a lot of these characters. They used to treat me so good too, until I ran for office. I used to get the greatest publicity. A friend of mine said, “You know, you used to be the king of getting great publicity. What happened?” I said, “Well, I have some views that they’re opposed to for a lot of bad reasons.”  A lot of really bad reasons. But when you look at what’s happening to our country, it’s incredible. And the fundamentals are so strong. The stock market — I just see with all of the ups and downs — since Election Day, is up 37 percent from Election — 37 percent.  Now, it did a little bit of a correction. In fact, I started to say — you know, I was in it for like 13, 14 months from election. I say, “Is this sucker ever going down a little bit? This is a little embarrassing.” It was up 100, up 200, up 1,000, up 150, up 90, up 63. I said, “Good, that’s better.”  You know, hey, we’ve got seven years to go, folks. You know, we got a long time to go.  So thank you, everybody. You’ve been amazing. You’ve been amazing. You know what Matt didn’t say — when I was here in 2011, I made a speech, and I was received with such warmth. And they give — they used to give — I don’t know if Matt does that because he might not want to be controversial, but they used to give “the best speech of CPAC.” Do they do that still, Matt? Because you better pick me or I’m not coming back again.  But — and I got these — everybody, they loved that speech. And that was, I think, Matt — I would say, that might have been the first real political speech that I made. It was a love fest — 2011, I believe the time was — and a lot of people remembered, and they said, “We want Trump. We want Trump.” And after a few years, they go by, and I say, “Here we are. Let’s see what we can do.” And then everybody said, “He cannot get elected. He cannot do it.” You need 270 votes. You need Electoral College — which, by the way, is much tougher than the popular vote. The popular vote, actually, would be so much easier. You go three or four states, and you just go and you just do great job. Hillary forgets that. You know, she went to these states. I said, “What’s she doing? Why does she keep going back to California?”  Crazy. Next time, they’re going to remember Iowa. They’re going to remember Ohio.  Remember? They spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania to no avail.  They spent a lot of money. They spent a lot of money in North Carolina, the great state of North Carolina.  We did very well there. We have a great person in the room, Mark Meadows, from North Carolina.  He’s around here. Where’s Mark? Where’s Mark? And Deb. And we have Jim Jordan. Warriors. Warriors all.  We have a lot of great — we have a lot of great people here. But, you know, we just — we hit a chord. And if you remember, 2011, probably that was the beginning of what we’ve done. And hopefully, at the end of a period of time, people are going to say thank you, because it is not easy. We’re fighting a lot of forces. They’re forces that are doing the wrong thing. They’re just doing the wrong thing. I don’t want to talk about what they have in mind. But they do the wrong thing. But we’re doing what’s good for our country for the long-term viability and survival. Like, for instance, $700 billion got approved for our military. Our military was going to hell.  We declined to certify the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. That was a horrible deal.  Whoever heard you give $150 billion to a nation that has no respect for you whatsoever? They’re saying “Death to America” while they’re signing the agreement. If somebody said “Death to America” while I’m signing an agreement, and I’m President, I immediately say, “What’s going on here, folks? I’m not signing.”  What’s going on? They just kept going. Kerry — Kerry may be the worst negotiator I’ve ever seen.  How about this guy — how about — and Obama, of course — he’s the one. But how about $1.8 billion in cash? Did you ever see what, like, a million dollars in hundred-dollar bills? A lot of people do it as a promotion. It’s a lot. It’s big. It’s like big.  Now, take that, go to $1.8 billion in cash. $1.8 billion. For what? For what? Why did we do this? Why did we do it? Anyway, we didn’t certify, and lots of interesting things are happening with that whole mess. But we have to treat — people that treat us well, we treat them well. People that treat us badly, we treat them much worse than they can ever imagine. That’s the way it has to be.  That’s the way it has to be. We officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  You know, every President campaigned on, “We’re going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.” Everybody — for many Presidents — you’ve been reading it. And then they never pulled it off. And I now know why. Because I put the word out that I may do it. Right? I said, I’d do it in my campaign, so that usually means — unless I find something — I’m going to do it. I was hit by more countries and more pressure and more people calling, begging me, “Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t do it.” I said, “We have to do it. It’s the right thing to do. It’s the right thing to do. We have to do it.”  And I did it. But every other President really lied, because they campaigned on it. That was always a big part of the campaign. And then they got into office; they never did it. So I understand why they didn’t do it. Because there was tremendous — the campaign against it was so incredible. But you know what? The campaign for it was also incredible, and we did the right thing.  So we’ve kept our promise, as I said, to rebuild our military, eliminating the defense sequester, which is a disaster. And I don’t know if you saw the number, $700 billion. You know, ultimately, that comes before everything else. We can talk about lots of things. But if we don’t have a strong military, you might not be allowed into this room someday. Okay? You may not have your houses, your homes, your beautiful communities. We better take care of our military. These are the greatest people, and we’re going to take care of our veterans.  We’re going to take care of the vets. We’ve been doing a good job on the vets. And after years of rebuilding other nations — we rebuild other nations — we rebuild other nations that have a lot of money, and we don’t ever say, “Hey, you got to help.” We’re finally rebuilding our nation. We’re rebuilding our nation.  And we’re restoring our confidence and our pride. All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We defend our Constitution, and we believe in the wisdom of our Founders. Our Constitution is great.  We support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.  True. We know that a strong nation must have strong borders. We celebrate our history and our heroes, and we believe young Americans should be taught to love their country and to respect its traditions. Don’t worry, you’re getting the wall. Don’t worry, okay? I heard some — ( ) — we’re getting the wall.  I had a couple of these characters in the back say, “Oh, he really doesn’t want the wall. He just used that for campaigning.” I said, are you — can you believe it?  You know, I say, every time I hear that, the wall gets 10 feet higher. You know that, right?  Every time. Every single time. Okay? No, we’re going to have the wall or they’re not going to have what they want. You know, we have a problem: We need more Republicans. We have a group of people that vote against us in a bloc. They’re good at two things: resisting, obstruction. Resisting, obstruction. And they stick together. They do. They always vote in a bloc. You know, it’s very rare that you get a couple of them to come your way. Even on the tax cuts. I mean, we’re going to be fighting these people in the ’18 election. We’re going to be fighting people that voted against the tax cuts, because the tax cuts are phenomenal and popular, and helping people and helping our country. You saw Apple just brought $350 billion in; Exxon brought $50 billion in.  So we’re going to be fighting. The fact is, we need more Republicans to vote.  We want to get our agenda. Because, now, what we have to do is in order to get a vote to fix our military, we have to give them $100 billion in stuff that nobody in this room, including me, wants, in many cases. It’s terrible. We need more Republicans. That’s why you have to get out and you have to fight for ’18. You have to do it.  We salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance.  And we all proudly stand for the national anthem.   Above all else, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are at the center of American life. We know that.  Because in America, we don’t worship government, we worship God.  Our nation’s motto is, “In God We Trust.”  And this week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. Leader. He was a leader. He was a great man. We will never forget the historic crowds, that voice, the energy, and the profound faith of a preacher named Billy Graham.  Great man and great family. Franklin Graham. Great family. And they were for us — I’ll tell you, they were for us. Right from the beginning they were for us. As a young man, Billy decided to devote his life to God. That choice not only changed his life, it changed our country. And indeed, it even changed the world. Reverend Graham’s belief in the power of God’s word gave hope to millions and millions who listened to him with his very beautiful, but very simple message: God loves you.  And a very special tribute — because it’s almost never done — on Wednesday, we will celebrate Billy Graham’s life as he lies in honor in the Rotunda of our Capitol.  Very rarely. One day — Wednesday until Thursday, about 11 o’clock on Wednesday. I bet those lines are going to be long and beautiful, because he deserves it. Not everybody deserves it. But very few people — you look back, Ronald Reagan was so honored. Very few people are so honored. That’s a big thing. And he really, almost more than anybody you can think of, he deserves to be in the Rotunda. So that’s going to be very special. Wednesday at 11 o’clock.  And Paul, and Mitch, and the whole group, they worked very hard to make it all happen. So we want to thank them too. Everywhere you go, all over the country, in cities small and large, Americans of all faiths reach out to our Creator for strength, for inspiration, and for healing. Great time for healing. In times of grief and hardship, we turn to prayer for solace and for comfort. In recent days, our entire nation has been filled with terrible pain and sorrow over the evil massacre in a great community — Parkland, Florida. This senseless act of mass murder has shocked our nation and broken our hearts. This week, I had the honor of meeting with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, with families who have lost their children in prior shootings — great families, great people — and with members of the local community right here in Washington, D.C. Our whole nation was moved by their strength and by their courage. We listened to their heart-wrenching stories, asked them for ideas, and pledged to them — and I can speak for all of the senators and congressmen and congresswomen, all of the people in this room that are involved in this decision — that we will act. We will do something. We will act. With us on Wednesday was one of the families whose daughter didn’t come home last week — a beautiful young woman named Meadow Pollack. Incredible family. I had them in the Oval Office. Incredible people. You’ve probably seen her picture. She had a beautiful, beautiful smile, and a beautiful life. So full of promise. We wish there was something — anything — we could do to bring Meadow and all of the others back. There are not enough tears in the world to express our sadness and anguish for her family, and for every family that has lost a precious loved one. No family should ever save — and ever have to go in and suffer the way these families have suffered. They’ve suffered beyond anything that I’ve ever witnessed. A father drops his daughter off at school, kisses her goodbye, waves to her — she’s walking up the path — and never sees her alive again. Gets a call. Can’t believe it. Thinks it’s a nightmare. Wants to wake up from the nightmare. So we want to hear ideas from Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs about how we can improve security at our schools, tackle the issue of mental health. Because this was a sick person — very sick — and we had a lot of warning about him being sick. This wasn’t a surprise. To the people that knew him, this wasn’t even a little bit; in fact, some said, were surprised it took so long. So what are we doing? What are we doing? We want to ensure that when there are warning signs, we can act and act very quickly. Why do we protect our airports, and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools?  It’s time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers. We don’t want them in our schools.  We don’t want them. When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones, it just puts our students in far more danger.  Far more danger. Well-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches and people that work in those buildings; people that were in the Marines for 20 years and retired; people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard; people that are adept — adept with weaponry and with guns — they teach. I mean, I don’t want to have 100 guards standing with rifles all over the school. You do a concealed carry permit.  And this would be a major deterrent because these people are inherently cowards. If they thought — like, if this guy thought that other people would be shooting bullets back at him, he wouldn’t have gone to that school. He wouldn’t have gone there. It’s a gun-free zone. It says, this is a gun-free zone; please check your guns way far away. And what happens is they feel safe. There’s nobody going to come at them. This way, you may have — and remember, if you use this school as an example — this is a very big school with tremendous floor area and a lot of acreage. It’s a big, big school. Good school. A big, big school. You’d have to have 150 real guards. Look, you had one guard. He didn’t turn out to be too good, I will tell you that. He turned out to be not good. He was not a credit to law enforcement, that I can tell you. That I can tell you.  But as I’ve been talking about this idea — and I feel it’s a great idea, but some people that are good people are opposed to it; they don’t like the idea of teachers doing it. But I’m not talking about teachers. You know, CNN went on, they said, “Donald Trump wants all teachers.” Okay? Fake news, folks. Fake news. Fake news. I don’t want a person that’s never handled a gun that wouldn’t know what a gun looks like to be armed. But out of your teaching population — out of your teaching population, you have 10 percent, 20 percent of very gun-adept people. Military people, law enforcement people, they teach. They teach.  And something I thought of this morning. You know what else? And I thought of it since I found and watched Peterson, the deputy who didn’t go into the school because he didn’t want to go into the school. Okay? He was tested under fire, and that wasn’t a good result. But you know what I thought of as soon as I saw that? These teachers — and I’ve seen them at a lot of schools where they had problems — these teachers love their students. And the students love their teachers, in many cases. These teachers love their students. And these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns. And they feel safe. And I’d rather have somebody that loves their students and wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn’t know anybody and doesn’t know the students, and, frankly, for whatever reason, decided not to go in even though he heard lots of shots being fired inside. The teachers and the coaches and other people in the building — the dean, the assistant dean, the principal — they can — they love their people. They want to protect these kids. And I think we’re better with that. And this may be 10 percent or 20 percent of the population of teachers, et cetera. It’s not all of them. But you would have a lot, and you would tell people that they’re inside. And the beauty is, it’s concealed. Nobody would ever see it unless they needed it. It’s concealed. So this crazy man who walked in wouldn’t even know who it is that has it. That’s good. That’s not bad; that’s good. And a teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.  They love their students. They love those students, folks. Remember that. They love their students. And I’m telling you that would work. Because we need offensive capability. We can’t just say, oh, it’s a gun-free school. We’re going to do it a little bit better. Because then you say, “What happens outside?” The students now leave school, and you got a thousand students — you got 3,500 at the school we’re talking about — but you have a thousand students standing outside. The teachers are out there also. If a madman comes along, we have the same problem, but it’s outside of the school. Or they drive cars. There are a lot of things that can happen. I want to stop it. And I know it’s a little controversial to say — but I have to say, since I started this two days ago, a lot of people that were totally opposed to it are now agreeing. They love their students. They don’t want their students to be killed or to be hurt.  So we have to do something that works. And one of the big measures that we will do, and everybody in this room I think has to agree — and there’s nobody that loves the Second Amendment more than I do. And there’s nobody that respects the NRA — they’re friends of mine. They backed us all. They’re great people. They’re patriots.  But they’re great people. But we really do have to strengthen up, really strengthen up background checks. We have to do that.  And we have to do — for the mentally ill, we have to do very, very — we don’t want to people that are mentally ill to be having any form of weaponry. We have to be very strong on that.  So we’re going to do that. And I really believe that Congress is going to get it through this time. And they have a different leader. They have somebody that wants to get it through; not somebody that’s just all talk, no action, like so many of these folks. This is somebody that wants to get it through. But I also want to protect — we need a hardened site. It has to be hardened. It can’t be soft. Because they’ll sneak in through a window, they’ll sneak in some way. And, again, you’re standing there totally unprotected. You know the five great soldiers from four years ago, three of them were world-class marksmen. They were on a military base in a gun-free zone. They were asked to check their guns quite far away. And a maniac walked in, guns blazing, killed all of five of them. He wouldn’t of had a chance if these world-class marksmen had — on a military base — access to their guns. And I’m going to look at that whole policy on military bases. If we can’t have — ( ) — all five were killed. All five. The guy wouldn’t have had a chance. But we’re going to look at that whole military base, gun-free zone. If we can’t have our military holding guns, it’s pretty bad. We had a number of instances on military bases. You know that. So we want to protect our military. We want to make our military stronger and better than it’s ever been before.  We also need to create a culture in our country that cherishes life and human dignity. That’s part of what we’re talking about.  A culture that condemns violence and never glorifies violence. We need to foster real human connections and turn classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors that want to fight for us. We’re not just having a conversation about school safety. You’ve had conversations — in all fairness, I’m pretty new on this job. We’re here a little more than a year. I’ve been watching this stuff go on for 20 years. The President gets up, everybody is enthusiastic for the first couple of days, then it fades, fades, fades. Nothing ever gets done. We want to see if we can get it done. Let’s get it done right.  We really owe it to our country. And I’ve been watching for a long time. Seen a lot of words, and I’ve seen very little action. And, you know, if you think about, most of its just common sense. It’s not “do you love guns, do hate guns.” It’s common sense. It’s all common sense. And some of the strongest advocates about what I’m saying are the strongest advocates — I know them very well — political people — the strongest advocates for the Second Amendment. But this is common sense. In addition to securing our schools, we’re also implementing a strategy to secure our streets. We want our kids to be safe everywhere they go, whether they’re in a classroom walking home from school or just outside playing with their friends.  Every child deserves to grow up in a safe community surrounded by a loving family and to have a future filled with opportunity and with hope.  Thank you. Thank you. Just not fair. Reducing violent crime in America is a top priority for my administration, and we will do whatever it takes to get it done. No talk. We’re going to do what it takes to get it done.  As you’ve seen, pretty well reported, that we’re significantly increasing gun prosecutions by tremendous percentages, and we’re working to get violent offenders off our streets and behind bars, and get them behind bars quickly, for a long time, or get them the hell out of our country.  In 2017, we brought cases against more violent offenders than any administration in a quarter of a century — more than any administration. And we’re just gearing up. We have tough people. I’ll tell you what — when you deal with MS-13, the only thing they understand is toughness. They don’t want anything. All they understand is toughness. If that ICE agent or Border Patrol agent is tougher than them, they respect him. We got the toughest guys you’ve ever seen. We got tough.  They don’t respect anything else. And they shouldn’t be in our country. They were let in for years. They shouldn’t be, and we’re getting them out. Our administration prosecuted more people for federal firearm charges than has been done in more than a decade. And again, we’re just gearing up. We’ve convicted 1,200 gang members and nearly 500 human traffickers.  You know what human trafficking — who would think that we have this in this age? And with our foreign partners, we’ve helped charge or arrest more than 4,000 members of the savage gang that we talked about — MS-13. Now, they don’t like guns. You know why? They’re not painful enough. These are animals. They cut people. They cut them. They cut them up in little pieces and they want them to suffer. And we take them into our country because our immigration laws are so bad. And when we catch them — it’s called catch-and-release — we have to, by law, catch them and then release them. Catch-and-release. And I can’t get the Democrats — and nobody has been able to for years — to approve common-sense measures that, when we catch these animal-killers, we can lock them up and throw away the keys.  In 2017, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 100,000 criminal aliens who have committed tens of thousands of crimes. And believe me, these are great people. They cannot — the laws are just against us. They’re against — they’re against safety. They don’t make sense. And you meet with Democrats and they’re always fighting for the criminal. They’re not fighting for law-abiding citizens. They’re always fighting for the criminal.  Doesn’t make sense. Here are just some of the criminal charges and convictions for the aliens arrested by ICE: 11,000 charges or convictions for sex crimes; 48,000 for assault; 13,000 for burglary; and 1,800 for killing people. We’re cracking down on sanctuary cities. Can you believe this?  Where they protect — that’s another one. Because we want our cities to be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, not for criminals.  And, by the way, the Senate Democrats and the House Democrats have totally abandoned DACA. They’ve total — they don’t even talk to me about it. They have totally abandoned. You know, we get the reputation — like DACA, it’s not Republican. We’ll let me tell you, it is Republican, because we want to do something about DACA, get it solved after all these years. The Democrats are being totally unresponsive. They don’t want to do anything about DACA, I’m telling you. And it’s very possible that DACA won’t happen, and it’s not because of the Republicans, it’s going to be because of the Democrats. And frankly, you better elect more Republicans, folks, or it will never happen.  The Democrats voted in favor of sanctuary cities. In other words, they voted to protect criminal aliens instead of voting to protect the American citizens. To secure our country, we are calling on Congress to build a great border wall to stop dangerous drugs and criminals from pouring into our country.  And now they’re willing to give us the wall, but they don’t want to give us any of the laws to keep these people out. So we’re going to get the wall, but they don’t want to give us all of the other — chain migration, lottery. Think of a lottery. You have a country. They put names in. You think they’re giving us their good people? Not too many of you people are going to be in a lottery. So we pick out people. Then they turn out to be horrendous, and we don’t understand why. They’re not giving us their best people, folks. They’re not giving us — I mean, use your heads. They’re giving us — it’s a lottery. I don’t want people coming into this country with a lottery. I want people coming into this country based on merit. Based on merit.  I want people, and we all want to be admitting people, who have skills, who can support themselves financially, who can contribute to our economy, who will love our people, and who will share our values, who will love our country.  I don’t want people who drive a car at 100 miles an hour down the West Side Highway and kill 8 innocent victims, and destroy the lives of 14 more. Nobody talks about that. Nobody ever talks about the people that have been so horribly injured, who lose legs and arms, in Manhattan, where I used to spend my time. I know it very well, the stretch along the West Side Highway. People run in order to stay in shape. They want to be healthy, they want to look good. They’re running all the time; I see it. They run. We work in different ways.  But they run. No, but think of this — they run. And they’re so — they want to be fit. They’re proud people. They want to be fit, and they’re running up and down West Side Highway. It’s beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing. And this maniac takes a car going down the highway, and just turns to a right, and he kills eight. But he really badly wounded 12 to 14 other people. So somebody think of it: Runs to stay in shape, leaves the house, is jogging along, working hard, ends up going home two months later with no leg or with no arm, or with two legs missing. Nobody ever talks about that. They talk about the people, rightfully, that were killed. But they don’t talk about the people whose lives have been just changed — just changed. They don’t talk about that. This guy came in through chain migration and a part of the lottery system.  They say 22 people came in with him. In other words, an aunt, an uncle, a grandfather, a mother, a father, whoever came in. But a lot of people came in. That’s chain migration. Let’s see how those people are doing, by the way. We’ve got to change our way. Merit system. I want merit system. Because you know what’s happening? All of these companies are coming into our country. They’re all coming into our country. And when they come in, we need people that are going to work. I’m telling you, we need workers now. We need workers.  But when I walked in today, did anyone ever hear me do the snake during the campaign? Because I had five people outside say, “Could you do ‘The Snake’?” And I said, well, people have heard it. Who hasn’t heard “The Snake”? You should read it anyways. (Laughs.) Let’s do it anyway. I’ll do it. All right? Should we do it?  Now, this was a rock-and-roll song — little amendments — a rock-and-roll song. But every time I do it, people — and you have to think of this in terms of immigration. We have to have great people come into our — I want people to come into our country. And I want people that are going to help us. And I don’t want people that are going to come in and be accepting all of the gifts of our country for the next 50 years and contribute nothing. I don’t want that, and you don’t want that. I want people that are going to help and people that are going to work for Chrysler, who is now moving from Mexico into Michigan, and so many other — and Apple, by the way.  And Foxconn up in Wisconsin. They’re going to need 25,000 workers. I want people that can come in, and get to work and work hard. Even if it means a learning period — that’s fine. But I want people that are going to come in and work. And I want people that love us and look at security. And they want you to be safe, and they want to be safe. I want great people coming into this country. I don’t want people coming in the way they do now, because I want people that contribute. So this is called “The Snake.” And think of it in terms of immigration. And you may love it, or you may say, isn’t that terrible. Okay? And if you say, isn’t that terrible, who cares? Because the way they treat me — that’s peanuts compared to the way they treat me. Okay?  Immigration. “On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tenderhearted woman saw a poor, half-hearted, frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. ‘Poor thing,’ she cried, ‘I’ll take you in, and I’ll take care of you.’ ‘Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in, for Heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,’ sighed the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk, and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night, and soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been revived. ‘Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for Heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,’ sighed the vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom, ‘You’re so beautiful,’ she cried. But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, surely you would have died.’ She stroked his pretty skin again, and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. ‘Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for Heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,’ sighed the vicious snake. ‘I saved you,’ cried the woman. ‘And you’ve bitten me. Heaven’s why? You know your bite is poisonous, and now I’m going to die.’ ‘Oh, shut up, silly woman,’ said the reptile with a grin. ‘You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.'”  And that’s what we’re doing with our country, folks. We’re letting people in, and it’s going to be a lot of trouble. It’s only getting worse. But we’re giving you protection like never before. Our law enforcement is doing a better job than we’ve ever done before. And we love our country. And we’re going to take care of our country. Okay? We’re going to take care of our country.  So just in finishing, our country is starting to do very well. Our economy is blazing. Jobs are at a record level. Jobs are so good. 2.7 million jobs created since the election.  Unemployment claims have reached a 45-year low.  African American unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history.  Hispanic unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history.  Women — women unemployment is at the lowest level in 18 years.  Wages are rising for the first time in many, many years.  Small business confidence is at a record high. And thanks to our massive tax cuts, millions of Americans are getting to keep a great percentage of their money instead of paying it to a government that throws it out the window.  So I just leave you with this: We have to fight Nancy Pelosi. They want to give your money away. They want to give your money away. They want to end your tax cuts. They want to do things that you wouldn’t even believe, including taking your Second Amendment rights away. They will do that.  So we have to get out there and we have to fight in ’18 like never before — just the way you fought with us. Just the way you fought with us. You fought so hard, and you were so tough, and you were so smart. You were so smart. And you know what? I know for a fact you did the right thing, because we’re looking at the numbers. And the numbers — even they have to give credit for the kind of numbers that we’re producing. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.  Under my administration, the era of economic surrender is over. We’re renegotiating trade deals that are so bad, whether it’s NAFTA or whether it’s World Trade Organization, which created China — that created — if you look at China, it was going along like this, then we opened, stupidly, this deal. And China has been like a rocket ship ever since. And now, last year, we had almost a $500 billion trade deficit with China. We can’t have that. We can’t have that. I have great respect for President Xi, but we can’t have that. We have to go, and we have to do what we have to do. We just can’t let countries — as an example, Mexico. We have a $100 billion trade deficit with Mexico. What does that tell you? You know what it tells you? NAFTA is no good. It never was any good. But for some reason, nobody ever changed it. They emptied our factories — you got to see the car plants and the auto plants in Mexico. Like — you’ve never seen anything like it before. I want those companies — and they’re starting — I want them back here. I want them back here. They’re going to come back here, too.  And we want to make our neighbors happy. But we can’t continuously have other nations taking advantage of the United States like never before. And this has gone on for a long time. This has gone on for longer — the last administration was a disaster, but this has gone on for much longer than the last administration. And we got to change it. We’re going to change it. So we’re renegotiating deals. And you know what? Hate to say it, but if we can’t make a fair deal for the United States, we will terminate the deal and we’ll start all over again.  We have to do it.  So, under my administration, and with your help — don’t forget — you, many of you, were the forgotten people. You were the people that, when the polls came out, they didn’t know that you existed. The Democrats are trying to figure out who you are, because they want to get you back. But you are people — we’ve had people that never voted, but they’re great patriots — but they never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Then they go to the election, they’ve got Trump-Pence, Trump-Pence. They got hats, they got all sorts of things. Trump over here — “Make America Great Again” hats. Right?  So our country is starting to do well. We are going to make it great, better, safer than it ever was before. The reason is you. This has been a great movement. They try like hell, they cannot stand what we’ve done. But we’re doing the right thing. We’re even doing the right thing for them. They just don’t know it yet.  They just don’t know it yet. Even the media — the media will absolutely support me sometime prior to the election. All those horrible people back there, they’re going to support me. You know why? Because if somebody else won, their ratings would go down, they’d all be out of business.  Nobody would watch. They’d all be out of business. So I just want to tell you that we are going to win. I’d love you to get out there, work really hard for ’18. We need more Republicans to keep the tax cuts and keep all of this going. And I love you. I respect you. I appreciate everything you’ve done for the country.   I appreciate everything you’ve done. I do want to say, because people have asked — North Korea — we imposed today the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before.  And frankly, hopefully something positive can happen. We will see. But hopefully something positive can happen. But that just was announced, and I wanted to let you know. We have imposed the heaviest sanctions ever imposed. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for everything. You have been incredible partners.  Incredible partners. And I will let you know in the absolute strongest of terms, we’re going to make America great again, and I will never, ever, ever let you down. Thank you very much.  Thank you."
"Thank you to our First Lady, Melania, who has been so incredible.  Thank you. And we are blessed to have you as our First Lady. Really are. It’s great to be back in the beautiful state of New Hampshire.  I don’t know if you remember, but this is the first place I came for the primaries.  And this is the room right here. So I like this room. This has been a good room. We’re honored to be joined by your wonderful and very talented Governor, Chris Sununu. Chris, thank you.  Thank you, Chris. Oh, and there’s another talented governor. Governor Sununu, stand up.  I have to tell you, there was nobody tougher on Trump at the beginning.  It’s true. There was nobody on television tougher. And then we met each other and we liked each other, and he went from the worst to the best. Governor, thank you. (Laughs.) I mean that, too. Thank you. I want to thank also Attorney General Sessions, and Secretary—thank you, Jeff.—( )—Secretary Azar, Secretary Nielsen, and Surgeon General Adams for joining us at this very important event. The First Lady and I just visited the Manchester Fire Department Safe Station. Talking about it all over the country. The Fire Chief, Dan Goonan, and all of the first responders with us today, thank you. You’ve been incredible, and you’re saving American lives. We’re also joined by a number of law enforcement officers who we love. Our police, DEA, ICE, Border Patrol agents, and Customs officers work night and day to keep drugs out of our communities and criminals off of our streets.  So today, we thank you, we honor you, and we want you to know that we will always have your backs 100 percent. Thank you very much, law enforcement. Thank you.  I especially want to acknowledge all of the families with us today who have endured terrible hardships because of the opioid crisis, and especially those who have lost precious loved ones. I’ve been saying this for a long time, and it all started right here in New Hampshire, because I see what you’re going through. About as bad as there is anywhere in the country. And I said I’d be back, and we are back. And we’re pouring a lot of money and a lot of talent into this horrible problem. And we pledge to honor the memory of those you lost with action and determination and resolve. We’ll get it. We will not rest until the end. And I will tell you, this scourge of drug addiction in America will stop. It will stop.  Every day, 116 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose. In New Hampshire, the overdose, really, death rate—I mean, can you believe this? The death rate is double the national average. It’s got difficulties like people wouldn’t believe. Defeating this epidemic will require the commitment of every state, local, and federal agency. Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis. Never been like this. Hundreds of years—never been like this. And we will raise a drug-free generation of American children. Last October, we declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Should have been done a long time before. Since then, we’ve worked with Congress to ensure at least 6 billion additional dollars, going through right now, in new funding in 2018 and 2019 to combat the opioid crisis. And we will be spending the most money ever on the opioid crisis.  On our most recent National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, people across the country turned in more than 900,000 pounds of unused or expired prescription drugs—more than the weight of three Boeing 757s. Our Customs and Border Protection—and these people, the job they do is incredible—seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl last year, nearly three times the amount seized in 2016. And I told China: Don’t send it.  And I told Mexico: Don’t send it. Don’t send it. In 2017, ICE arrested criminal aliens with 76,000 charges and convictions for dangerous drug crimes. Last year, the Department of Justice prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioid, all of the trafficking, and the related crimes—3,000 cases—including a pharmacist, a physician’s assistant, and an opioid trafficker, each charged with committing serious drug crimes in New Hampshire. Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will hold you accountable.  Thank you. Here in New Hampshire, I applaud all of the Drug Enforcement Agents and law enforcement officers who recently coordinated Operation Granite Shield, an 18-hour enforcement action targeting drug traffickers that resulted in the arrest of 151 people. These are terrible people, and we have to get tough on those people, because we can have all the Blue Ribbon committees we want, but if we don’t get tough on the drug dealers, we’re wasting our time. Just remember that. We’re wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty.  You know, it’s an amazing thing. Some of these drug dealers will kill thousands of people during their lifetime—thousands of people—and destroy many more lives than that. But they will kill thousands of people during their lifetime, and they’ll get caught and they’ll get 30 days in jail. Or they’ll go away for a year, or they’ll be fined. And yet, if you kill one person, you get the death penalty or you go to jail for life. So if we’re not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kills thousands of people and destroy so many people’s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough. This isn’t about nice anymore. This isn’t about committees. This isn’t about let’s get everybody and have dinners, and let’s have everybody go to a Blue Ribbon committee and everybody gets a medal for, frankly, talking and doing nothing. This is about winning a very, very tough problem. And if we don’t get very tough on these dealers, it’s not going to happen, folks. It’s not going to happen. And I want to win this battle. I don’t want to leave at the end of seven years and have this problem, okay?  I don’t want that. Right? Thank you. Not going to happen. Thank you all. A lot of voters in this room. I see that. Thank you.  No, we’re going to solve this problem. We’re going to solve it with brains, we’re going to solve it with resolve, and we’re going to solve it with toughness. Because toughness is the thing that they most fear. That’s what they most fear. So to the brave agents and officers, thank you for protecting us all. Last year, my commission on combatting the incredible crisis of opioids issued 56 recommendations. My administration agreed with all of the commission’s goals, and we’ve worked aggressively to put them into action. Today, I’m here to announce additional steps that we’re taking as part of our nationwide initiative to address the opioid crisis, and, by the way, the drug crisis—the general drug crisis. First, we’re taking action to reduce drug demand by preventing Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. So important. That includes increasing federal funding for the development of non-addictive painkillers. And we have to come up with a solution where we come up with a painkiller that’s not so addictive. And we can do it. We’re not that far off. We can do it. These things are incredibly addictive. So we’re going to find that answer also. Here with us today are Jim and Jean Mozer. They lost their beautiful son, Adam, to a fentanyl overdose. His addiction began with prescription pills he found in their kitchen cabinet. They have since begun the Zero Left initiative to help families get rid of excess painkillers. Jim and Jean, we’re sorry for your loss—a great boy; he’s a great boy—and we applaud your strength and your leadership. And where are you? Where are you? Come on up. Come on up here. Come on up here.  Tell us about your boy.  Thank you, darling. You take care of yourself. Okay?  Thank you. Thank you very much.  Thank you. Appreciate it. And so many cases like that. We’re also taking action to prevent addiction by addressing the problem of overprescribing.  And our Department of Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies. We’ll bring it at a federal level.  Some states are already bringing it, but we’re thinking about bringing it at a very high federal level. And we’ll do a job. We’re going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years. We’re also going to make sure that virtually all prescriptions reimbursed by the federal government follow best practices for prescribing. We’ll ensure that opioid addiction is not subsidized by the American taxpayer.  The best way—so important—and the best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with. As part of that effort—( )—so important. And this has been something that I’ve been very strongly in favor of: spending a lot of money on great commercials showing how bad it is, so that kids seeing those commercials during the right shows on television or wherever—the Internet—when they see these commercials they—“I don’t want any part of it.” That’s the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And we’ll make them very, very bad commercials. We’ll make them pretty unsavory situations. And you’ve seen it before, and it’s had an impact on smoking and cigarettes. You see what happens to the body; you see what happens to the mind. So we’re announcing a new website, CrisisNextDoor.gov, where Americans can share their stories about the danger of the opioid addiction and addictions. But we’re thinking about doing, really, a largescale rollout of commercials that show how bad it is for the kids. And when they see those commercials, hopefully, they’re not going to be going to drugs of any kind—drugs of any kind. And we’ll save a lot of lives, and we’ll make their life a lot easier. This epidemic can affect anyone, and that’s why we want to educate everyone. The second part of our initiative is to reduce the supply of illicit drugs. Ninety percent of the heroin in America comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the Democrats will agree with us and we’ll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out.   It’s pretty amazing. They don’t want to go with DACA, because they don’t care about DACA. But they’re trying to tie the wall to DACA, and DACA to the wall. And they want to keep DACA for the campaign instead of getting it approved, which we could do very easily. The Republicans are totally in favor of doing something substantial for DACA. But the Democrats like it as a campaign issue, so they don’t get it approved. And they want to tie it to the wall, which is okay with me. But both should get approved. They don’t want it to be approved. Remember what I said: They don’t want it to be approved. They want to make it part of the campaign. Well, we’ll make it part of the campaign, also. And we’ll win, because we’re going to win on those issues.  My administration is also confronting things called “sanctuary cities” that shield dangerous criminals. And every day, sanctuary cities release illegal immigrants and drug dealers, traffickers, and gang members back into our communities. They’re protected by these cities. And you say, “What are they doing?” They’re safe havens for just some terrible people. Some terrible people. And they’re making it very dangerous for our law enforcement officers. You see it all the time. As the people of New Hampshire have learned firsthand, ending sanctuary cities is crucial to stopping the drug addiction crisis. And your governor, who is great—the numbers are going down in New Hampshire. I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but the numbers are going down. Chris, we were just—stand up, Chris.  It’s really one of the few bright spots where the numbers actually are going down, and that’s a tremendous achievement. Thank you, Chris.  According to a recent Dartmouth study, the sanctuary city of Lawrence, Massachusetts is one of the primary sources of fentanyl in six New Hampshire counties. ICE recently arrested 15 MS-13 gang members—these are not good people, folks. Okay? These are bad, bad people. They don’t use guns. They’d rather use knives because it’s more painful and it takes longer. These are bad people—in Boston, Massachusetts, which is a place where you have sanctuary cities. I’m repeating my call on Congress to block funds for sanctuary cities and to close the deadly loopholes that allow criminals back into our country and into our country in the first place.  You know, some things are very understandable. We have lots of issues where we’re on both sides of an issue, and you can understand the other side even though you don’t agree. Sanctuary cities are hard to understand for people because they don’t get it. They don’t get it. You see what’s going on in California, how terrible it is, how dangerous it is. And they’re all trying to protect sanctuary cities. And whether it’s Kate Steinle or so many others, they’d be around today if these people weren’t allowed back into our country through, in this case, the southern border, at least five times. And look at the damage, and then look at this verdict. Look at the verdict. Can you believe the verdict? So we have to get a lot smarter. We have to get a lot tougher. And speaking of tough, because here with us today is ICE Agent Derek Dunn. Derek worked with state police to uncover a major drug smuggling operation in Lawrence, Massachusetts.  Where’s Derek? Derek. Where’s Derek? Come here, Derek. I love tough guys. We need tough guys. Come here, Derek.   Thank you. He didn’t know he was going to do that.  And you didn’t know you were going to do that. But that’s in honor of your boy, right? You made a big impact. I also want to mention ICE Agent Ron Morin and Manchester Police Detective Patrick Maguire. They helped lead the team that arrested a terrible human trafficker who used opioids to harm, in a very violent way, his victims. Thank you both for bringing the trafficker to a very strong and swift justice. Where are you guys? Thank you.  Stand up, fellas. Thank you. Thank you. We’re also shutting down illegal online marketplaces and preventing drugs that come from China and other countries from bypassing our borders. And we’re getting very tough on it. It’s not that we have a choice. We don’t have a choice. We can be nice, and we can be soft and weak, and you’re not going to have a country left. So we have to strengthen up, and strengthen up our laws so that we can do what we have to do. We have to stop this from happening. Drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year. And that’s why my Department of Justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we’ve ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that I talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. And that penalty is going to be the death penalty.  If you look at—if you look at other countries—I’ve gotten to know the leaders of many countries. And I won’t mention names, but you know the countries I’m talking about. I go around, “How is your drug problem?” “We don’t have much of a drug problem.” “What do you mean you don’t have a drug problem?” “Well, we don’t have.” I say, how come? “We have zero tolerance for drug dealers.” I said, “What does that mean?” “That means we have the death penalty for drug dealers. We don’t have a drug problem.” Take a look at some of these countries where they don’t play games. They don’t have a drug problem. We have court cases that last 10 years, and then they get out at the end. We got to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to change the laws, and we’re working on that right now. The Department of Justice is working very, very hard on that. But the ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Now, maybe our country is not ready for that. It’s possible—it’s possible that our country is not ready for that. And I can understand it, maybe. Although, personally, I can’t understand that. But there are people that are good people, that are strong, smart people, and they would differ with most of us. But I think unless you do that, unless you have really, really powerful penalties, led by the death penalty for the really bad pushers and abusers, we are going to get nowhere. And I’m telling you, we are going to get somewhere. Companies must also be held accountable. The Department of Justice recently created a task force to coordinate investigations and lawsuits against manufacturers and other bad actors that harm our citizens. And I can tell you that Jeff Sessions, who’s here with us now, feels so strongly about this. And they’re working very hard and very effectively on that, and so we appreciate that very much. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you. I can think of nothing more important. The third part of our initiative is to get lifesaving help to those who need it. We’re going to make sure our first responders have access to lifesaving overdose-reversing drugs—which, by the way, are amazing. Here with us today is Mike Kelly, the president of Adapt Pharma. Adapt Pharma makes an overdose-reversing drug for opioids, which I’ve watched and seen work. It’s called Narcan. It’s actually incredible. Today, we applaud Adapt Pharma’s decision to provide free—free—Narcan to all high schools, colleges, and universities in America. I’d like you to come up, Mike. Come up.  Where’s Mike? Come up, Mike. That’s really an amazing and generous offer. Thank you. Tell us a little bit about that, Mike. Please.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Mike. It’s amazing, generous. And I’ve watched the police and the fire—they come around and they’ve become so good at it. But I’ve seen people that are just about dead wake up. Now, the problem is, they then go back, in many cases, to the drugs, and they do it again and again and again. But we have to work on that. We have to work on that very, very strongly. I also want to recommend and commend a Richmond-based company, Kaléo, for donating more than 300,000 doses of their overdose-reversing drug to first responders, which has already saved more than 5,000 lives in a very short period of time. My administration has made clear that medical providers can share crucial information with family members about an overdose so that their loved ones can help them get into treatment. We need treatment. We’re making medically assisted treatment more available and affordable, and we continue to increase competition and drive down drug prices. And we’re driving them down. We’re going to have a major news conference, probably at the White House, in about a month, because all of you people—and I’m talking about prescription drugs, not necessarily the drugs that we’re talking about here. But we pay, as a country, so much more for drugs because of the drug lobbies and other reasons, and the complexity of distribution, which is basically another term for saying, “How do we get more money?” And if you compare our drug prices to other countries in the world, in some cases it’s many times higher for the exact same pill, or whatever it is, in the exact same package, made in the exact same plant. And we’re going to change that. And I would like to ask Secretary Azar just to come up and mention opioid, but also talk about how we’re getting your drug prices down. And we’ve already saved billions of dollars for our country, and it’s reflected in much lower drug prices. Watch what’s going to happen over a short period of time. This man is one of the great professionals, ran an incredibly successful drug company. Who knows better than the guy running the drug company, Eli Lilly? That’s your company, right? Or was.  Now you’re on the other side, though. So nobody knows better. The most respected man in that industry—and we got him to work, because he loves our country. Would you tell them a little bit about what you have planned for drug prices and also opioids, in terms of stoppage? Please. Secretary.   Great.  Thank you, Alex. You’ll be seeing drug prices falling very substantially in the not-too-distant future, and it’s going to be beautiful. And I want to thank, also, Scott Gottlieb. Scott is working on different things, but one of them is called “Right to Try.” Do you know what “Right to Try” is? These are for people that are terminally ill. And there are very, very good-looking combinations of things, or pills, medicines, potential cures. And they’re terminal, and they’re not going to be living much longer. And we don’t have the right to give them these experimental drugs or these early-stage drugs that really show promise, for whatever reason. But they say because they don’t want to harm somebody, if you can believe it. They don’t want to harm. So the people will oftentimes go to foreign lands, foreign countries. They’ll do anything. They want hope. They want hope. “Right to Try.” So we’re working with Congressman Greg Walden and numerous other senators and congressmen. And I think we’re going to have good luck. The Democrats have been pushing back on it, but I think many of them are also coming along. It’s called “Right to Try.” A patient is terminal. There’s good progress made with a certain drug. We’re going to make it possible for that patient to get that drug. And maybe it’s going to work. It’s hope. It’s incredible; they’ve been talking about this for years and years and years. We’re going to get it approved. So important. All right?  To further expand treatment, I’m also calling on Congress to change the restrictive 1970s-era law that prevents Medicaid from paying for care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds. It’s such an important factor. In the meantime, my administration is granting waivers to states so they can help people who need treatment now, Governor. We’re also going to help inmates leaving prison get treatment so they can have a second chance to become productive, law-abiding citizens. And what we’ve really done for the inmates—you know, it’s very hard for them to get out of jail and get a job. What we’ve really done for them—better than anything we can sign, any legislation that we can pass demanding that you hire—we’re getting a great economy. It hasn’t been this good in many, many years. Some people say it’s never been this good. And what’s happened is, as you see, unemployment is way down, and people are starting to hire inmates. And the results are incredible. Some of these employers are calling up, saying, “Wow, what great people.” We’re giving them a second chance. It’s very, very important. So the tremendous economy is helping us very much with that program. We want every American—( )—thank you. We want every American to be able to be able to reach their full God-given potential. And we will succeed together as one people, one nation, and one great American family. Because Americans never give in, and we never, ever give up. This group never gives up, right? Never give up. Your boy.  The brave families here today remind us that the strength of America is found in the heart of our people. We see America’s heart in the parents who won’t accept addiction as the fate of their children. And if something horrible has befallen that family, they go around and they want to make sure it never happens to another family. And that’s why we thank you so much, and we thank your boy.  He did not die in vain. We see it in sons and daughters who cheer on moms and dads as they recover. We see it in the doctors and nurses who provide constant and loving care. We see it in the heroic law enforcement officers who race into unimaginable danger. We see it in EMTs and firefighters who act so quickly to save so many lives. And we see this American heart in the men and women who fight every day to help rescue their fellow citizens from the grips of addiction. These are the courageous souls who remind us that, for America, there is nothing beyond our reach. Nothing at all.  Nothing. We will defeat this crisis, we will protect our beautiful children, and we will ensure that tomorrow is better, brighter, stronger, and greater than ever before. Because as long as we have trust in our citizens, pride in our country, and faith in our God, we will not fail.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Together, we will end the scourge of drug addiction in America once and for all. We will win. We will beat it. We’ll be tough. We’ll be smart. We’ll be kind. We’ll be loving. We’ll do whatever we have to do. But we’re going to win. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.  Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Lee. Thank you.  And thank you also to Commander Harman. We’re grateful for your service, for your leadership, and this incredible organization. That’s what it is—it’s incredible.  I’m honored to be here today in Kansas City, Missouri, to pay tribute to the men and women who make freedom possible. Kansas City. And what a special place. What a special group of people. The Veterans of Foreign Wars, you people should be very proud of yourselves. I want to personally thank each and every one of you who has served our country in uniform, defended our nation in battle, and protected our great American flag. Thank you.  I also want to recognize a great Kansas City legend, who I met today at the plane—somebody that I’ve been a fan of for a long time; a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame—George Brett of the Kansas City Royals.  Where’s George? He’s around here someplace. I said, “George, how many years?” “Twenty.” “What was your batting average?” “.305.” I said, that’s pretty good—.305 for 20 years. Special guy. I want to thank a true patriot, your executive director, Bob Wallace, along with your outstanding National Auxiliary President, Dee Guillory. Thank you, Dee.  And congratulations to VFW’s incoming leadership, BJ Lawrence and Sandy Kreebull.  Where are they? Great. Great. Congratulations. We’re also joined by our brand new VA Secretary, Robert Wilkie—he’s going to be fantastic—who was just confirmed by the Senate last night with an overwhelming vote. The only ones, actually, that voted against him were all of the people, super-lefts, that are running against me in two and a half years.   Every one of them. If you want to know who’s running, just take a look at Wilkie’s score, because every single one of them—there will be probably quite a few more—but in the Senate, that was it. But what a great vote. And he’s going to do a fantastic job. There’s been nothing more important to me.  Thank you. Thank you. I also want to thank our Acting VA Secretary, Peter O’Rourke, for doing such a fantastic job in the meantime, holding down the fort until Wilkie got approved. And Peter is going to be joining the whole team, and they are doing numbers, and they are doing a job, with Choice and with all of the other things that we’ve gotten approved. They’re doing some job for our vets. It was a very important commitment that I made to you during the campaign, and we’re fulfilling that commitment. Several terrific members of Congress are here today as well. Great friends of mine; they’ve helped me so much. We’re joined by Kevin Yoder from Kansas.  Incredible guy. Kevin? Kevin Yoder. What an incredible guy. And members of Missouri’s congressional delegation: Vicky Hartzler, Billy Long, Jason Smith, along with your state’s Attorney General. Hopefully—we need him so badly—hopefully, your new senator-to-be, Josh Hawley. We need Josh badly.  Josh, thank you. In fact, Josh, do me a favor. Come up here just for a second. Just shake my hand. This guy is a special man. Come here, Josh. Come here.   Wow. Goodbye, folks.  That was great. What a great young man. Before going any further, I want to take this moment to send our prayers to the victims of the tragic boat accident that took place in your great state last week. And I have to tell you, the whole world was watching that. We lost 17 beautiful souls, including 9 members of one family, and babies for whom life was just beginning. Their lives were cut short, but they and their loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. A tragedy. We will hold their memory close to our hearts. I want to thank your Governor, Mike Parson—a friend of mine, a great person—for his leadership during this terrible tragedy, along with the Coast Guard and all of the first responders who were incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Next year will mark the 120th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the oldest major veterans organization in our country. That’s pretty good, right?  For more than a century, the VFW has represented American heroes who promoted American values. And they did so with honor. You are the universal symbol of the patriotic pride that beats loudly in every single American heart. We don’t apologize for America anymore. We stand up for America.  We stand up for the patriots who defend America.  And we stand up for our National Anthem.  We’re putting America first again, and we are seeing the incredible results. We’re destroying the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS—almost gone. We’re calling the threat by its real name, a name that wasn’t mentioned for a long time. It’s called radical Islamic terrorism. That’s what it is.  You have to know your enemy before you can defeat your enemy. Earlier this year, I recognized the true capital of Israel—as Josh said—Jerusalem, where we just opened the American Embassy.  They thought it would never be named. And after it was named, they thought it would never get built. And I built it within four months. How about that one? You know that story. Four months.  They came to my office; they had a document to be signed. One billion dollars for the embassy. I said, “$1 billion?” They didn’t have a site; they didn’t know anything. And our great Ambassador to Israel called—David Friedman, who’s a very successful lawyer in New York City; one of the most—and he said, “You know, we can do it a lot faster. We have a great site. We have a building already on the site. We could renovate the building quickly, and we could open the embassy, if you’d like to do that, sir.” And I said, “How much would it cost?” He said, “$150,000.” I said, “What?” What?  He said, “I think we can do it in four months.” So we’re talking about $1 billion, maybe in 20 years, maybe never. Probably never happens, right? We know what goes on. He starts out, “I’d rather build ships or I’d rather build something else,” if we can save the money.  We can save that money; let’s use it wisely. So I said, “David, let’s not do 150, let’s do, like, how about $400,000? And make it nicer.” And it’s beautiful. It just opened, and it is beautiful. So, we’re many years ahead of schedule. And I understand, frankly, every President, for the last many Presidents, have said, “We’re going to open our embassy in Jerusalem.” And then they never did it. They all failed. They never did it. And I understand why. Because when it came time, and when people were hearing rumors about it, I was inundated from calls of every leader from all over the world, imploring me, even demanding that we not do it, to a point where I never took their calls. I called them back after I did it. You know, it’s one of those jobs—( )—“let me call them back.”  I was getting calls from kings and presidents and dictators. I was getting a call from everyone. And when I knew what it was about, I’d say, “Tell them I’ll call them next week.”  Then I called them and I said, “Oh, I didn’t know you felt that way. Well, it’s too late.”  But I understand why they didn’t do it, because there was tremendous pressure. We did it. We’re proud of it. It’s there. Enjoy it.  And, by the way, the biggest fan may very well be the evangelicals. They wanted that built. They wanted that there. So we’re very—we’re very proud of it.  We’ve removed unnecessary restraints on our warfighters in Afghanistan. Those who risk their life and limb for our country, they deserve rules of engagement that give them the best opportunity to finally defeat the enemy.  And we’re making—for the first time in years, we’re making a lot of progress in Afghanistan. I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal.  And Iran is not the same country anymore. That I can say. And we’ll see what happens. But we’re ready to make a real deal, not the deal that was done by the previous administration, which was a disaster.  We’re also pursuing the denuclearization of North Korea and a new future of prosperity, security, and peace on the Korean Peninsula and all of Asia. New images, just today, show that North Korea has begun the process of dismantling a key missile site. And we appreciate that.  We had a fantastic meeting with Chairman Kim, and it seems to be going very well. I know we are joined today by many incredible veterans of the Korean War. Thank you for your courageous service. As you may know, we’re also working to bring back the remains of your brothers-in-arms who gave their lives in Korea. And I hope that, very soon, these fallen warriors will begin coming home to lay at rest in American soil. That’s starting the process.  At the very end of our meeting, I said to Chairman Kim—good relationship, good feeling—I said, “I would really appreciate if you could do that.” He said, “It will be done.” So I was very happy, and I think that process is starting fairly soon, we hope.  Because we believe in no American left behind. We believe in that, right? No American left behind.  I want to thank the VFW for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, prisoners of war, and those missing in action, and their families. No one better understands the horrors of war than the people in this room. It is the warrior who bears the scars of battle and who prays most fervently for peace. That is why we remember George Washington’s advice, that the best way to preserve the peace is to be prepared for war.  And that is exactly what we do all the time. My thinking is always on military and military strength. That is why I’m proud to report that we are now undertaking the greatest rebuilding of our United States military in its history.  We have secured $700 billion for defense this year, and $716 billion next year approved.  We’re ordering 147 new F-35 Lightning fighters. This is an incredible plane. It’s stealth; you can’t see it. So when I talk to even people from the other side, they’re trying to order our plane.  They like the fact that you can’t see it. I said, “How would it do in battle with your plane?” They say, “Well, we have one problem: We can’t see your plane.”  That’s a big problem. Stealth. Super Stealth. The best in the world. We make the best military equipment in the world. Also, remember this: jobs.  We’re ordering 239 Apache and Black Hawk helicopters. You know what they are. They’re incredible.  Nineteen major naval vessels, and nearly 8,000 Humvees. And these will be Humvees that are used by our great soldiers, not handed out to everybody like you’ve been reading about in the past.  All made right here in the USA.  And we’re adding nearly 30,000 new soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. And I’ve directed the Pentagon to begin the process of creating the sixth branch of our military. It’s called the Space Force.  We are living in a different world and we have to be able to adapt. And that’s what it is. A lot of very important things are going to be taking place in space. And I just don’t mean going up to the moon and going up to Mars, where we’ll be going very soon. We’ll be going to Mars very soon. But from a military standpoint, space is becoming every day more and more important. I’m also thrilled to say that we have secured for our military servicemembers and their families the largest—you don’t really want it, you’re too patriotic for this—the largest pay raise in almost a decade.  Largest pay raise. You don’t want it. Nah. Anybody willing to give it up for the sake of your country?  Okay, keep it. You deserve it. You really do. It’s been a long time since you’ve gotten a raise. You deserve it. My administration is committed to ensuring that our warfighters have the tools, the resources, the firepower that they need to defeat our enemies with overwhelming force. Hopefully we will never have to use the kind of power that I’m building and helping to build for you. Hopefully people will look at us and they’ll say, “Let’s pass. Let’s pass.” ( ) America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict. But if conflict is forced upon us, we will defend ourselves. And if we must, we will fight and we will do nothing but win.  As the great General MacArthur once said, “In war there is no substitute for victory.” Victory. We’re also committed to ensuring that when our warriors return home as veterans, they receive the best care anywhere on Earth.  Since taking office, and working alongside of the VFW—and, by the way, your representatives have done an incredible job on helping us with the VA. A complicated subject. So many different things. They help us so much. Because we put in legislation—I said, let’s make sure it’s legislation that’s good and that works, not legislation that’s obsolete before we even get it. If we’re going to fight like hell to get everybody to approve it, let’s get approved what’s good. And we’re enacted some of the largest VA reforms in the history of the VA.  Probably the largest. Last year, I signed into the law landmark VA Accountability Act, which nobody thought we could get approved. Nobody. We’re good at getting things approved.  Nobody thought. Now, when a bad person—maybe a federal employee, in this case—but somebody bad mistreats or neglects or abuses our great veterans in their time of need, we can turn to them, look at them in the eye, and say, “You’re fired. Get out! Get out!”  Before, there was nothing you could do. You had to live with these people. We’ve gotten rid of a lot of people over the last year. Only the bad ones. The good ones we cherish. We cherish the good ones. But we had some bad apples, and they’re gone. As promised, we established the White House VA Hotline, and every VA medical center now offers same-day emergency mental healthcare. Something very important.  We’re greatly expanding tele-health and walk-in clinics so our veterans can get anywhere at any time—they can get what they need. They can learn about the problem. And they don’t have to necessarily drive long distances and wait. We are also—it’s been a very big success.  We’re also processing veteran disability claims more quickly than ever before, by far. The VA has implemented the Decision Ready Claims process where claims can be completed in under two weeks. We’re striving for one day—but under two weeks. It used to be many, many months.  Last year, I signed legislation—it’s amazing, I just said, “last year.” It’s been a long time already, hasn’t it?  That was some campaign, wasn’t it?  I signed legislation so that veterans can use their GI Bill education benefits at any point in their lifetime. It’s a big difference.  They never expire, so vets can get the education they need when it is right for them. And with the VFW’s tremendous help, we passed Veterans Choice—the biggest thing ever.  The biggest thing. That’s got to be the biggest improvement you can have. So now, if you can’t get treatment that you need in a timely manner—people used to wait two weeks, three weeks, eight weeks—they couldn’t get to a doctor—you will have the right to see a private doctor immediately and we will pay for it. And you know what? It’s very, very cost effective. And thousands and thousands of lives are going to be saved. And your quality of life is going to be so much better. So you don’t have to wait online for two and a half weeks to see a doctor, like in the past. Veterans Choice has been passed.  And my administration also understands that we cannot be a safe country if we are not a prosperous country. We have to think of ourselves. You have to see these trade deals I’m working on; they’re a disaster. We’re losing hundreds of billions of dollars with individual countries a year. And they’re sticking—you got to stick it out. You got to just—we got to fight it. Nobody else fought it. I went to some of the countries, I said, “How did it get so imbalanced?” They said, “Nobody ever called.”  They said, “Nobody ever called.” They’d do whatever they wanted and we’d just put up with it. Not any longer folks. Not any longer.  We’re making tremendous progress. They’re all coming. They don’t want to have those tariffs put on them. They’re all coming to see us. And the farmers will be the biggest beneficiary.  Watch. We’re opening up markets. You watch what’s going to happen. Just be a little patient. They’re all aiming at anybody that likes me. And they have lobbyists like nobody has ever seen. They have the best lobbyists ever put together. I was hearing and reading that they have some of the greatest lobbying teams ever put together. “You’ve got to stop the President from putting tariffs on these countries and these companies that are ripping off the United States. You’ve got to stop him.” Just remember, we’re going to do something that, honestly, nobody else could do. Nobody else could do. We have a lot of —  Thank you, darling.  I like you too. I like her. Thank you very much. That was good timing.  We’re now in the midst of a great economic revival. And it’s for that reason that I chose—this is the time. Last year, our country lost 817 billion—with a “B”—dollars on trade. We lost $817 billion. And people say, “Oh, could you do it this week? Could you get it done immediately?” These countries have been ripping us off for decades. It doesn’t take a week. It takes a little longer. But we’re going to get it done. But just remember, we can’t lose $817 billion. We rebuilt China. What the European Union is doing to us is incredible. How bad. They made a $151 billion last year—our trade deficit with the European Union. They sound nice but they’re rough. They’re all coming in to see me tomorrow. They’re all coming to the White House. I said, “You have to change.” They didn’t want to change. I said, “Okay. Good. We’re going to tariff your cars.” They send millions of cars—Mercedes, all of them, BMW. So many cars. I said, “We’re going to have to tariff your cars.” They said, “When can we show up? When can we be there?”  “Would tomorrow be okay?” Oh, folks, stick with us. Stick with us.  Amazing. But remember, they have the biggest, best, strongest lobbyists, and they’re doing a number. Just stick with us. Don’t believe the crap you see from these people—the fake news.  I mean, I saw a piece on NBC today. NBC—not just CNN. CNN is the worst.  But I saw a piece on NBC; it was heart-throbbing. They were interviewing people—they probably go through 20, and then they pick the one that sounds like the worst. But they went through a group of people. In fact, I wanted to say, “I got to do something about this Trump.”  Terrible. And that piece was done by the lobbyists and by the people that they hire. It was a total setup. This country is doing better than it’s ever done before, economically. This is the time to take off the rip-off of tariff. We have to do it.  You know, other countries have tariffs on us. So when I say, “Well, I’m going to put tariffs on them, they all start screaming, ‘He’s using tariffs.'” China charges us, when we make a car, a 25 percent tariff. We charge them 2.5 percent. Other than that, it’s a fair deal. Okay?  Similar things with other countries, like the European Union. They’re a big abuser. But it’s all working out. And just remember: What you’re seeing and what you’re reading is not what’s happening. And I’ll tell you, I have so many people that are so in favor—because we have to make our country truly great again. Remember? “Make America Great Again.” And then, in two and a half years, it’s called, “Keep America Great.” So the way we keep America great is to make at least reasonable—I’m not saying—at least reasonable, at least fair trade deals. Not stupid trade deals, like we’ve put up with for 25 years. So we’re changing it, and we’re changing it rapidly.  Over the last little more than a year and a half, we’ve created 3.7 million jobs since election. African American, Hispanic, and Asian American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded in our country’s history—the lowest levels. Unemployment—lowest level.  Remember, I used to say—I said it here: “What do you have to lose?” I was right. Women’s unemployment recently achieved a 65-year low. Lowest in 65 years.  You’ll like this one. Veterans’ unemployment has fallen to the lowest level in almost 18 years. We’re working to make it better. I’m sorry. You know, “18 years” isn’t so good when you hear “history” and “65 years.”  Eighteen years. And I’ll guarantee, within a month or two months, that 18 will be even a much higher number. We take great care of our vets. Consumer, business, and manufacturing confidence has reached its all-time highs. Confidence is all-time high. We’ve cut a record number of job-killing regulations. No President, no matter how long they’ve been in office—even though we’re only here for a short time—has cut anywhere near the regulations. And these are unnecessary. These are waste regulations. It would take 20 years to get approval to build a highway. We’re trying to bring it down to one year. We have it down to about two. We’re trying to get it down to one. And if it doesn’t work, or if it’s environmentally unsound, or there’s something wrong, we’re not going approve it. But we’re not going to take a process 20, 21 years, and then raise your hand that it’s not approved. We’ll let you know in a period of a year or maybe two. Right now, it’s at two; we’re trying to bring it down to one. We passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Biggest in history.  And unfortunately, we had tremendous opposition for lowering your taxes from Claire McCaskill. She voted against. Unbelievable.  Unbelievable. And she wants to now end it so that you pay more. You figure this one out. I don’t know—is that good? You figure that one out. In the first quarter of this year alone, American companies repatriated a record of nearly $300 billion—this is in the first quarter. And it’s coming back into our country, with our companies, and our employment, and building plants, and factories, and headquarters in our country, where it belongs.  We think the number—and this is all because of our tax reform and tax cuts—we think the number will be close to $4 trillion, coming back into our country—money that would never have been seen by you, or us, or me.  And just like I promised, we are confronting the unfair trade deals, and we are doing it like nobody has ever done, because our workers have been cheated, our companies have been cheated. They’ve stolen our wealth. They’ve brought it to other countries. As you know, I campaigned on that issue; it’s very close to my heart. I understand that issue better than anybody. I don’t like it when they close a factory in your state, or a plant in your great state, and they move it to another country, and they make the product. They fire all of you, and they make the product, and they send it back into our country to be sold tax-free. I don’t like that. I don’t like that.  We’re stopping it. We’re stopping it. Because companies are moving back into our country like never before. You saw Chrysler announce, many are announcing. Japan has just announced two big companies are opening up… in Michigan. We have a lot of companies coming back into our country. You haven’t seen that for 25 years. You haven’t seen it.  And we need workers. Because our unemployment rate at 3.8 percent is so low—now we’re taking people off the rolls, and we’re training people, but we need workers. And that’s why I want people coming in. You know, people don’t say this, and they certainly don’t report it, but I want people coming into our country, but I want them coming in based on merit. I want the merit system, so they can help us.  Merit. The forgotten men and women of our country are forgotten no more. The Democrats are trying to find out, “Who are these people that came out to vote? Where did they come from?” Remember that? “Where did they come from?” Now they know, but they’re not going to the Democrats who are going so far left that nobody can believe it. They want open borders, and crime is okay. We want strong borders and we want no crime. Other than that, we’re very similar.  Other than that, we’re very similar. We also know that to be a strong nation, we have to have these strong borders. We cannot send our military to confront threats abroad, only to allow those same threats to cross our borders and to threaten us right here at home.  We help other countries protect their borders, and we don’t protect our own borders. How about that? We’re fighting every day to secure our borders, and we’re doing a great job. But we’re not given the tools. We have the worst laws in any country, ever, in history. We have catch-and release. You catch them, and now we say, “Give me your name. Oh, good—come back in a couple of years. We’ll take you to court. You’re released.” This is—these are—this is the policy of fools. Catch-and-release. You catch even a criminal, you catch a bad person, you release the person as soon as you catch them. We have to end it. Despite that, we’re doing a great job. And ICE—ICE. Oh, ICE. Thank goodness for ICE.  Because we have some of the worst drug dealers, terrorists, criminals, and MS-13 gang members—and we’re either throwing them the hell in jail, or throwing them out of our country. And ICE goes up there, and they walk in like it’s another day in the office. Thank goodness for ICE.  The Democrats want to abandon ICE. They want to end ICE. They’re too strong. I saw one of the people get—they’re too strong. They’re too strong. I think MS-13 is strong, too.  The only thing they understand is strength. They don’t understand anything but strength. And ICE is tough and smart, and they track them down, and they stop tremendous amounts of crime. And these are great people, and they’re not being treated properly.  And the fact is, instead of supporting our ICE officers, many of these Democrat politicians who are, really, disciples of a very low IQ person, Maxine Waters — —and perhaps even worse, Nancy Pelosi — —they’ve launched vicious smears on the brave men and women who defend our communities. ICE officers work in dangerous conditions to protect our communities. And more than a third of ICE officers happen to be veterans themselves. About a third.  But Democratic politicians want to abolish ICE. They want to see open borders. Can you imagine? You know, every once in a while you’ll hear something, and usually you understand. Like in deal-making, you always have to understand the other side. When you hear “open borders,” when you hear “get rid of ICE,” when you hear some of the things that they’re proposing, it’s like you can’t even understand it. Can you imagine, open borders, you’d have millions of people pouring into our country. Millions and millions of people. Many people that you don’t want in our country. But you would have millions of people pouring into our country. The crime would be unbelievable. And they want to get rid of the crime fighter, on top of everything else. “Open the border and get rid of your crime fighters.” You don’t understand it. Nobody understands it. But I hope they keep it up, because we’re going to have a lot of fun in four months, and we’re going to have a lot of fun in 2020 running against that.  My administration will always stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and Border Patrol. They’re all heroes. And I want them to know that we thank them.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars understand better than anyone the importance of honoring those who put service to their fellow citizens before they put service to themselves. That’s both at home and abroad.  Here with us today is an extraordinary man who embodies the highest ideals of loyalty, patriotism, and service. He is a World War II veteran from the great state of Pennsylvania. That’s another one we won.  We won you guys by 20 points. Of course, I’m not going to bring that up.  I’m not going to tell that to George Brett. Twenty points. Many of you know him well; he’s a lifelong member of the VFW—Sergeant Allen Jones. Where’s Allen? Where’s Allen?  Sergeant. Should we bring him up?  Come on, Allen. Come on.  He’s only 94, and the Secret Service made him walk about 100 yards out of his way, but that’s okay.  That’s okay.   Yes.  I’ve got time.  Yes.  Anytime you want. Anytime.  That’s right.  Oh, it’s beautiful. Thank you. Beautiful. Wow. Let me have—(  and  ). I have a good one here, Allen. That’s so beautiful.  Going to stay up here. Okay, I got to do this. You got it. Thank you, Allen. Thank you.  I started to get a little bit concerned when he was finishing.  Well, this is a President that will have you in the Oval Office. So all of my people back there, they’re working it out already. Okay?  With honor. And we pay tribute not only to Allen, but to all of the heroes of the Greatest Generation.  And I’d like to take this moment to recognize every World War II veteran in the audience today. Each of you is a national treasure. It’s true.  We will never forget what you did for us—ever. From Bunker Hill to Belleau Wood, from Iwo Jima to the Inchon Landing, Americans have stormed into danger, stared down evil, and stood strong and tall for God, country, and freedom.  Anytime we see an American in uniform from the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, or Coast Guard, our hearts swell with pride. And anywhere those uniforms appear, our enemies tremble with fear because they know there is no greater force for peace and justice than the United States military.  To every single member of the VFW, because of your service, your courage, and your example, we are restoring the dreams and the glory, and the greatness of America. We will never give in. We will never give up. And we will never stop fighting for our country, our flag, and our freedom.  Together we will keep on fighting and we will keep on winning as one people, one family, and one nation under God. Thank you. God bless you.  God bless our veterans. And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much."
"Madam President, Mr. Secretary-General, world leaders, ambassadors, and distinguished delegates: One year ago, I stood before you for the first time in this grand hall. I addressed the threats facing our world, and I presented a vision to achieve a brighter future for all of humanity. Today, I stand before the United Nations General Assembly to share the extraordinary progress we’ve made. In less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country. America’s—so true.  Didn’t expect that reaction, but that’s okay. ( ) America’s economy is booming like never before. Since my election, we’ve added $10 trillion in wealth. The stock market is at an all-time high in history, and jobless claims are at a 50-year low. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all achieved their lowest levels ever recorded. We’ve added more than 4 million new jobs, including half a million manufacturing jobs. We have passed the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. We’ve started the construction of a major border wall, and we have greatly strengthened border security. We have secured record funding for our military—$700 billion this year, and $716 billion next year. Our military will soon be more powerful than it has ever been before. In other words, the United States is stronger, safer, and a richer country than it was when I assumed office less than two years ago. We are standing up for America and for the American people. And we are also standing up for the world. This is great news for our citizens and for peace-loving people everywhere. We believe that when nations respect the rights of their neighbors, and defend the interests of their people, they can better work together to secure the blessings of safety, prosperity, and peace. Each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history, and a people bound together by ties of memory, tradition, and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on Earth. That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control, and domination. I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs, and traditions. The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship. We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return. From Warsaw to Brussels, to Tokyo to Singapore, it has been my highest honor to represent the United States abroad. I have forged close relationships and friendships and strong partnerships with the leaders of many nations in this room, and our approach has already yielded incredible change. With support from many countries here today, we have engaged with North Korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace. In June, I traveled to Singapore to meet face to face with North Korea’s leader, Chairman Kim Jong Un. We had highly productive conversations and meetings, and we agreed that it was in both countries’ interest to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Since that meeting, we have already seen a number of encouraging measures that few could have imagined only a short time ago. The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction. Nuclear testing has stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have been released. And as promised, the remains of our fallen heroes are being returned home to lay at rest in American soil. I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done. The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearization occurs. I also want to thank the many member states who helped us reach this moment—a moment that is actually far greater than people would understand; far greater—but for also their support and the critical support that we will all need going forward. A special thanks to President Moon of South Korea, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and President Xi of China. In the Middle East, our new approach is also yielding great strides and very historic change. Following my trip to Saudi Arabia last year, the Gulf countries opened a new center to target terrorist financing. They are enforcing new sanctions, working with us to identify and track terrorist networks, and taking more responsibility for fighting terrorism and extremism in their own region. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of Syria and Yemen. And they are pursuing multiple avenues to ending Yemen’s horrible, horrific civil war. Ultimately, it is up to the nations of the region to decide what kind of future they want for themselves and their children. For that reason, the United States is working with the Gulf Cooperation Council, Jordan, and Egypt to establish a regional strategic alliance so that Middle Eastern nations can advance prosperity, stability, and security across their home region. Thanks to the United States military and our partnership with many of your nations, I am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as ISIS have been driven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria. We will continue to work with friends and allies to deny radical Islamic terrorists any funding, territory or support, or any means of infiltrating our borders. The ongoing tragedy in Syria is heartbreaking. Our shared goals must be the de-escalation of military conflict, along with a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. In this vein, we urge the United Nations-led peace process be reinvigorated. But, rest assured, the United States will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the Assad regime. I commend the people of Jordan and other neighboring countries for hosting refugees from this very brutal civil war. As we see in Jordan, the most compassionate policy is to place refugees as close to their homes as possible to ease their eventual return to be part of the rebuilding process. This approach also stretches finite resources to help far more people, increasing the impact of every dollar spent. Every solution to the humanitarian crisis in Syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fueled and financed it: the corrupt dictatorship in Iran. Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death, and destruction. They do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations. Instead, Iran’s leaders plunder the nation’s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the Middle East and far beyond. The Iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from Iran’s treasury, seized valuable portions of the economy, and looted the people’s religious endowments, all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war. Not good. Iran’s neighbors have paid a heavy toll for the region’s  agenda of aggression and expansion. That is why so many countries in the Middle East strongly supported my decision to withdraw the United States from the horrible 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal and re-impose nuclear sanctions. The Iran deal was a windfall for Iran’s leaders. In the years since the deal was reached, Iran’s military budget grew nearly 40 percent. The dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, increase internal repression, finance terrorism, and fund havoc and s  in Syria and Yemen. The United States has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda. Last month, we began re-imposing hard-hitting nuclear sanctions that had been lifted under the Iran deal. Additional sanctions will resume November 5th, and more will follow. And we’re working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially. We cannot allow the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet’s most dangerous weapons. We cannot allow a regime that chants “Death to America,” and that threatens Israel with annihilation, to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on Earth. Just can’t do it. We ask all nations to isolate Iran’s regime as long as its aggression continues. And we ask all nations to support Iran’s people as they struggle to reclaim their religious and righteous destiny. This year, we also took another significant step forward in the Middle East. In recognition of every sovereign state to determine its own capital, I moved the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. The United States is committed to a future of peace and stability in the region, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That aim is advanced, not harmed, by acknowledging the obvious facts. America’s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong over the years, time and time again. This is true not only in matters of peace, but in matters of prosperity. We believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal. The United States will not be taken advantage of any longer. For decades, the United States opened its economy—the largest, by far, on Earth—with few conditions. We allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely across our borders. Yet, other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets in return. Even worse, some countries abused their openness to dump their products, subsidize their goods, target our industries, and manipulate their currencies to gain unfair advantage over our country. As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year. For this reason, we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals. Last month, we announced a groundbreaking U.S.-Mexico trade agreement. And just yesterday, I stood with President Moon to announce the successful completion of the brand new U.S.-Korea trade deal. And this is just the beginning. Many nations in this hall will agree that the world trading system is in dire need of change. For example, countries were admitted to the World Trade Organization that violate every single principle on which the organization is based. While the United States and many other nations play by the rules, these countries use government-run industrial planning and state-owned enterprises to rig the system in their favor. They engage in relentless product dumping, forced technology transfer, and the theft of intellectual property. The United States lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs, nearly a quarter of all steel jobs, and 60,000 factories after China joined the WTO. And we have racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits over the last two decades. But those days are over. We will no longer tolerate such abuse. We will not allow our workers to be victimized, our companies to be cheated, and our wealth to be plundered and transferred. America will never apologize for protecting its citizens. The United States has just announced tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese-made goods for a total, so far, of $250 billion. I have great respect and affection for my friend, President Xi, but I have made clear our trade imbalance is just not acceptable. China’s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated. As my administration has demonstrated, America will always act in our national interest. I spoke before this body last year and warned that the U.N. Human Rights Council had become a grave embarrassment to this institution, shielding egregious human rights abusers while bashing America and its many friends. Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, laid out a clear agenda for reform, but despite reported and repeated warnings, no action at all was taken. So the United States took the only responsible course: We withdrew from the Human Rights Council, and we will not return until real reform is enacted. For similar reasons, the United States will provide no support in recognition to the International Criminal Court. As far as America is concerned, the ICC has no jurisdiction, no legitimacy, and no authority. The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country, violating all principles of justice, fairness, and due process. We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy. America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. Around the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance, but also from other, new forms of coercion and domination. In America, we believe strongly in energy security for ourselves and for our allies. We have become the largest energy producer anywhere on the face of the Earth. The United States stands ready to export our abundant, affordable supply of oil, clean coal, and natural gas. OPEC and OPEC nations, are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don’t like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices, and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on. We are not going to put up with it—these horrible prices—much longer. Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and intimidation. That is why we congratulate European states, such as Poland, for leading the construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs. Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course. Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment of expansionist foreign powers. It has been the formal policy of our country since President Monroe that we reject the interference of foreign nations in this hemisphere and in our own affairs. The United States has recently strengthened our laws to better screen foreign investments in our country for national security threats, and we welcome cooperation with countries in this region and around the world that wish to do the same. You need to do it for your own protection. The United States is also working with partners in Latin America to confront threats to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration. Tolerance for human struggling and human smuggling and trafficking is not humane. It’s a horrible thing that’s going on, at levels that nobody has ever seen before. It’s very, very cruel. Illegal immigration funds criminal networks, ruthless gangs, and the flow of deadly drugs. Illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations, hurts hardworking citizens, and has produced a vicious cycle of crime, violence, and poverty. Only by upholding national borders, destroying criminal gangs, can we break this cycle and establish a real foundation for prosperity. We recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests, just as we ask other countries to respect our own right to do the same—which we are doing. That is one reason the United States will not participate in the new Global Compact on Migration. Migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens. Ultimately, the only long-term solution to the migration crisis is to help people build more hopeful futures in their home countries. Make their countries great again. Currently, we are witnessing a human tragedy, as an example, in Venezuela. More than 2 million people have fled the anguish inflicted by the socialist Maduro regime and its Cuban sponsors. Not long ago, Venezuela was one of the richest countries on Earth. Today, socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty. Virtually everywhere socialism or communism has been tried, it has produced suffering, corruption, and decay. Socialism’s thirst for power leads to expansion, incursion, and oppression. All nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone. In that spirit, we ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. Today, we are announcing additional sanctions against the repressive regime, targeting Maduro’s inner circle and close advisors. We are grateful for all the work the United Nations does around the world to help people build better lives for themselves and their families. The United States is the world’s largest giver in the world, by far, of foreign aid. But few give anything to us. That is why we are taking a hard look at U.S. foreign assistance. That will be headed up by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. We will examine what is working, what is not working, and whether the countries who receive our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart. Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends. And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense. The United States is committed to making the United Nations more effective and accountable. I have said many times that the United Nations has unlimited potential. As part of our reform effort, I have told our negotiators that the United States will not pay more than 25 percent of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. This will encourage other countries to step up, get involved, and also share in this very large burden. And we are working to shift more of our funding from assessed contributions to voluntary so that we can target American resources to the programs with the best record of success. Only when each of us does our part and contributes our share can we realize the U.N.’s highest aspirations. We must pursue peace without fear, hope without despair, and security without apology. Looking around this hall where so much history has transpired, we think of the many before us who have come here to address the challenges of their nations and of their times. And our thoughts turn to the same question that ran through all their speeches and resolutions, through every word and every hope. It is the question of what kind of world will we leave for our children and what kind of nations they will inherit. The dreams that fill this hall today are as diverse as the people who have stood at this podium, and as varied as the countries represented right here in this body are. It really is something. It really is great, great history. There is India, a free society over a billion people, successfully lifting countless millions out of poverty and into the middle class. There is Saudi Arabia, where King Salman and the Crown Prince are pursuing bold new reforms. There is Israel, proudly celebrating its 70th anniversary as a thriving democracy in the Holy Land. In Poland, a great people are standing up for their independence, their security, and their sovereignty. Many countries are pursuing their own unique visions, building their own hopeful futures, and chasing their own wonderful dreams of destiny, of legacy, and of a home. The whole world is richer, humanity is better, because of this beautiful constellation of nations, each very special, each very unique, and each shining brightly in its part of the world. In each one, we see awesome promise of a people bound together by a shared past and working toward a common future. As for Americans, we know what kind of future we want for ourselves. We know what kind of a nation America must always be. In America, we believe in the majesty of freedom and the dignity of the individual. We believe in self-government and the rule of law. And we prize the culture that sustains our liberty -– a culture built on strong families, deep faith, and fierce independence. We celebrate our heroes, we treasure our traditions, and above all, we love our country. Inside everyone in this great chamber today, and everyone listening all around the globe, there is the heart of a patriot that feels the same powerful love for your nation, the same intense loyalty to your homeland. The passion that burns in the hearts of patriots and the souls of nations has inspired reform and revolution, sacrifice and selflessness, scientific breakthroughs, and magnificent works of art. Our task is not to erase it, but to embrace it. To build with it. To draw on its ancient wisdom. And to find within it the will to make our nations greater, our regions safer, and the world better. To unleash this incredible potential in our people, we must defend the foundations that make it all possible. Sovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured, or peace has ever prospered. And so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all. When we do, we will find new avenues for cooperation unfolding before us. We will find new passion for peacemaking rising within us. We will find new purpose, new resolve, and new spirit flourishing all around us, and making this a more beautiful world in which to live. So together, let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose peace and freedom over domination and defeat. And let us come here to this place to stand for our people and their nations, forever strong, forever sovereign, forever just, and forever thankful for the grace and the goodness and the glory of God. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the nations of the world. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Just a short time ago, I had the honor of presiding over the swearing-in of five new great American citizens. It was a beautiful ceremony and a moving reminder of our nation’s proud history of welcoming legal immigrants from all over the world into our national family. I told them that the beauty and majesty of citizenship is that it draws no distinctions of race, or class, or faith, or gender or background. All Americans, whether first generation or tenth generation, are bound together in love and loyalty, friendship and affection. We are all equal. We are one team, and one people, proudly saluting one great American flag. We believe in a safe and lawful system of immigration, one that upholds our laws, our traditions, and our most cherished values. Unfortunately, our immigration system has been badly broken for a very long time. Over the decades, many Presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone, and no real progress has been made on immigration. We are now living with the consequences—and they are tragic—brought about by decades of political stalemate, partisan gridlock, and national neglect. There is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action. Thousands of children are being exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north. In fact, many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually accosted or assaulted. Nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care. Vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through our border and into our communities, including meth, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl. Drugs kill 78,000 Americans a year and cost our society in excess of $700 billion. Heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week, 90 percent of which comes across our southern border. We can stop heroin. Illegal immigration reduces wages and strains public services. The lack of border control provides a gateway—and a very wide and open gateway—for criminals and gang members to enter the United States, including the criminal aliens who murdered a brave California police officer only a day after Christmas. I’ve gotten to know and love Angel moms, dads, and family who lost loved ones to people illegally in our country. I want this to end. It’s got to end now. These are not talking points. These are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent, precious human beings every single day on both sides of the border. As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis, and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other. Our immigration system should be the subject of pride, not a source of shame, as it is all over the world. Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction. The good news is, these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right. Both sides in Washington must simply come together, listen to each other, put down their armor, build trust, reach across the aisle, and find solutions. It is time to reclaim our future from the extreme voices who fear compromise and demand open borders, which means drugs pouring in, human trafficking, and a lot of crime. That is why I am here today, to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border. If we are successful in this effort, we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real, bipartisan immigration reform. And it won’t stop here. It will keep going until we do it all. The proposal I will outline today is based on, first and foremost, on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals—and professionals they are. They know what they’re doing. It is a compassionate response to the ongoing tragedy on our southern border. In recent weeks, we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions. By incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in our plan, we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support. And I think many will. This is a commonsense compromise both parties should embrace. The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen. Walls are not immoral. In fact, they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives and stop drugs from pouring into our country. Our plan includes the following: $800 million in urgent humanitarian assistance; $805 million for drug detection technology to help secure our ports of entry; an additional 2,750 border agents and law enforcement professionals; 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the court backlog of, believe it or not, almost 900,000 cases. However, the whole concept of having lengthy trials for anyone who sets one foot in our country unlawfully must be changed by Congress. It is unsustainable. It is ridiculous. Few places in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare. Our plan includes critical measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse. This includes a new system to allow Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children, thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep. To physically secure our border, the plan includes $5.7 billion for a strategic deployment of physical barriers, or a wall. This is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high-priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water. We already have many miles of barrier, including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract.  It will be done quickly.  Our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need.  It will have an unbelievable impact. If we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced.  Some say it could be cut in half.  Because these criminals, drug smugglers, gangs, and traffickers do not stop at our border; they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you’d least expect them. They go all over our country. A steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry. Many of these security ideas have been proposed by Democrats themselves, and all of them have been supported by Democrats in the past, including a physical barrier, wall, or fence. Furthermore, in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform, there are two more elements to my plan. Number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago. This extension will give them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly. Secondly, our proposal provides a three-year extension of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. This means that 300,000 immigrants whose protected status is facing expiration will now have three more years of certainty so that Congress can work on a larger immigration deal, which everybody wants—Republicans and Democrats. And our farmers and vineyards won’t be affected because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent. That is our plan: border security, DACA, TPS, and many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable, and common sense, with lots of compromise. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring this bill to a vote this week in the United States Senate. Our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges. This plan solves the immediate crisis—and it is a horrible crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country. And it provides humanitarian relief, delivers real border security, and immediately reopens our federal government. If we are successful in this effort, then we can start the border  project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century. Once the government is open and we have made a down payment on border security, and immigration reform starts to happen, I plan to convene weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product, a great product—a product that we can all be proud of, having to do with that elusive immigration problem. Whatever we do, I can promise you this: I will never forget that my first duty, and ultimate loyalty, is to you, the American people. Any reforms we make to our immigration system will be designed to improve your lives, make your communities safer, and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generations to come. Thank you and God bless America.  Thank you."
"Thank you very much, everybody.  Before we begin, I’d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.  We’ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.  It’s going extremely well.  Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.  But we’re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.  Very good relationship that we have.  And we’re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal. We’re covering everything — all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn’t be done, whether it was theft or anything.  Anything.  The unfairness.  We’ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.  A lot of people think it’s $506 billion.  Some people think it’s much more than that.  We’re going to be leveling the playing field. The tariffs are hurting China very badly.  They don’t want them.  And frankly, if we can make the deal, it’d be my honor to remove them.  But otherwise, we’re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.  We’ve never had that before with China.  It’s been very much of a one-way street. So, that’s happening.  And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.  They haven’t respected us for a long time.  Not for a long time. The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we’re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement.  You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.  But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that’s just been strengthened further. So with the UK, we’re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.  We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.  The relationship there, also, is very good. We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.  And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.  And many other things.  A lot of positive things are going on. We’re working on a summit.  And you know all about the summit.  It will be in Vietnam — Hanoi.  And we will — we’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  We’ll be meeting in Hanoi.  I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.  And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.  A lot was done in the first summit.  No more rockets going up.  No more missiles going up.  No more testing of nuclear.  Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.  And we got back our hostages. But we hope we’re going to be very much equally as successful.  I’m in no rush for speed.  We just don’t want testing.  The sanctions, as you know, remain.  Everything is remaining.  China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.  And South Korea, I think you can say, has been — we’ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan. But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they’re supposed to be doing.  And that’s okay — as per the United Nations. So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.  I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.  We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.  They have really taken advantage of the United States.  Billions of dollars has been paid to them.  And we won’t let that happen. But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.  Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China — right smack in the middle — is phenomenal. And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.  So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam. Today, I’m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.  We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.  But we don’t control our own border. So we’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.  And we’re going to do it one way or the other — we have to do it — not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.  It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.  We’re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before. You look at other economies — they’re doing terribly, and we’re doing phenomenally.  The market is up tremendously today, not that that’s anything, but, you know — because I’ll go back in and they’ll say, “Oh, the market just went down.”  But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.  We have all the records.  We have every record.  But we’re getting close to that point again where we’ll create new records. So our country is doing very well, economically.  And we’ve done a lot.  But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.  When you look and when you listen to politicians — in particular, certain Democrats — they say it all comes through the port of entry.  It’s wrong.  It’s wrong.  It’s just a lie.  It’s all a lie. They say walls don’t work.  Walls work 100 percent.  Whether it’s El Paso — I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso — we had a tremendous crowd, and — tremendous crowd.  And I asked the people — many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.  And I asked them.  I said, “Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?”  You were there, some of you.  It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.  You know what they did. But that’s only one example.  There are so many examples.  In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.  And they had 23 murders.  It’s a lot of murders, but it’s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work.  And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.  You just take a look.  Almost everywhere.  Take a look at Israel.  They’re building another wall.  Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me — 99.9 percent.  That’s what it would be with us, too. The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.  They go around the wall and in.  Okay?  That’s what it is.  It’s very simple.  And a big majority of the big drugs — the big drug loads — don’t go through ports of entry.  They can’t go through ports of entry.  You can’t take big loads because you have people — we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement — looking. You can’t take human traffic — women and girls — you can’t take them through ports of entry.  You can’t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.  They open the door.  They look.  They can’t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall.  Everybody knows that.  Nancy knows it.  Chuck knows it.  They all know it.  It’s all a big lie.  It’s a big con game. You don’t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that’s it.  They can’t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there’s no barrier, and they come into the United States.  Welcome. We’ve detained more people.  Our border agents are doing such incredible work.  Our military has been incredible.  We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.  We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.  It’s very successful. But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.  And it’s very necessary.  We’ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.  They just are breaking.  They’re in the process of breaking up.  We have another one that we haven’t been able to break up yet. We’ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.  I want to thank the President.  I want to thank Mexico.  They have their own problems.  They have the largest number of murders that they’ve ever had in their history — almost 40,000 murders.  Forty thousand.  And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will. But I just want to thank the President, because he’s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.  We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.  It’s largely broken up.  Others have gotten through.  And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.  If we didn’t have the wall up, and if we didn’t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they’d be welcomed to the United States. One of the things we’d save tremendous — just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.  If we had a wall, we don’t need the military because we’d have a wall. So I’m going to be signing a national emergency.  And it’s been signed many times before.  It’s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.  It gave the Presidents the power. There’s rarely been a problem.  They sign it; nobody cares.  I guess they weren’t very exciting.  But nobody cares.  They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.  We’re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs. We have some of the greatest people I know.  They’ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign — almost from the first week.  The Angel Moms.  Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.  One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who — we’re talking about killed, in the year of ’18.  I said, “I haven’t seen you before.”  She said, “No, I’m new.”  I said, “That’s too bad.”  It’s too bad.  It’s so sad. Stand up, just for a second.  Show how beautiful your girl was.  Thank you. I have such respect for these people.  Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.  I have great respect for these people.  These are great people.  These are great people.  They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country. And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly.  And they’re not treated the way they should be.  They’re fighting for other people because they don’t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody. We have one young lady whose husband — please, stand up.  Your husband was just killed in Maryland.  Incredible man.  Just killed.  Beautiful children — won’t be seeing their father again. These are brave people.  These are people that — they don’t have to be here.  They don’t have to be doing this.  They’re doing it for other people.  So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?  I really do.  I want to thank you.  Incredible people. Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least — I think the number is ridiculously low — by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.  And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit — before I even started talking about the trade — it was a trade meeting.  It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important. I said, “Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.  It kills tens of thousands of people — I think far more than anybody registers.  And I’d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.”  And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.  Their criminal list — a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.  Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, “How about a fine?” And when I asked President Xi, I said, “Do you have a drug problem?”  “No, no, no.”  I said, “You have 1.4 billion people.  What do you mean you have no drug problem?”  “No, we don’t have a drug problem.”  I said, “Why?” “Death penalty.  We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.”  End of problem. What do we do?  We set up blue ribbon committees.  Lovely men and women — they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.  So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.  You can end the drug problem.  You can end it a lot faster than you think. But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.  And it’s a criminal penalty.  And the penalty is death.  So that’s, frankly, one of the things I’m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.  I think maybe there’s no more important point. We’re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.  It’s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.  Their market is down close to 40 percent.  Our market is way up.  We’ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.  Trillions.  Many trillions.  And China has lost trillions of dollars.  But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.  So we’ll see what happens. China is coming here next week, by the way.  They’re coming home, the traders.  And then China is coming here next week.  And then I’ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe — for some remaining deals.  We’ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves. So, we’re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.  And it’s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it’s unacceptable. And by signing the national emergency — something signed many times by other Presidents — many, many times.  President Obama — in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.  Criminal cartels.  It’s a very good emergency that he signed.  And we’re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.  So that would be a second national emergency.  But, in that case, it’s already in place. And what we want — really want to do — is simple.  It’s not like it’s complicated.  It’s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.  We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.  Nobody has done the job that we’ve ever done.  I mean, nobody has done the job that we’ve done on the border. And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy — and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.  You know, I hear a lot of people say, “Oh, well.  But maybe the previous administration…”  Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.  We would have been down the tubes.  The regulations were strangling our country.  Unnecessary regulations. By creating such a strong economy — you just look at your televisions or see what’s going on today; it’s through the roof.  What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.  And we’ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it’s a massive number of people. If we had the wall, it would be very easy.  We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.  We wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.  You wouldn’t need all of this incredible talent.  We would get — we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.  You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.  Law enforcement and Border Patrol. And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.  ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.  And, by the way, we’re going to be taking care of ICE.  You know, we talk about the new bill.  We’re going to be taking care of ICE.  They wanted to get rid of ICE.  And the bill is just the opposite of that.  A lot of good things happened. So, that’s the story.  We want to have a safe country.  I ran on a very simple slogan: “Make America Great Again.”  If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again. But we’ve done a fantastic job, but we haven’t been given the equipment.  We haven’t been given the walls.  And in the bill, by the way, they didn’t even fight us on most of the stuff.  Ports of entry.  We have so much money, we don’t know what to do with it.  I don’t know what to do with all the money they’re giving us.  It’s crazy. The only place they don’t want to give as much money — $1,375,000,000.  Sounds like a lot, but it’s not so much, although we’re putting it to much better use than it used to be.  A lot of the past administrations, they had — it was easy to get, and they didn’t build or they didn’t do what they could have done.  It would have been great.  It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.  People that should have stepped up did not step up.  They didn’t step up, and they should have.  Would have been easy.  Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.  But some people didn’t step up.  But we’re stepping up now. So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.  Whether it’s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it’s going to build a lot of wall.  We’re getting it done.  We’re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.  And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.  That’s where a lot of the money has been spent — on renovation.  In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.  But we’re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.  So — and we need new wall. So I want to thank everybody for being here.  I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.  Thank you very much.  We have great respect for you.  The real country, our real country — the people that really love our country, they love you.  So I just want you to know that.  I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you’re having. I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.  Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.  And we’re giving you a lot of surplus.  We’re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn’t like giving, previous to this administration.  But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.  And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.  And you have much better protection.  But I really appreciate you being here. So the order is signed.  And I’ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.  And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn’t be there.  And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we’ll get another bad ruling.  And then we’ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we’ll get a fair shake.  And we’ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.  They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won. And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.  Because we have a ban.  It’s very helpful.  Madam Secretary, is that right?  Without the ban, we’d have a bigger problem.  We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what’s going on in the world.  And we won. But somebody said, “President Trump lost on the ban.”  Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.  He — he didn’t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.  They didn’t want to say that.  They didn’t want to go that far.  They were saying how I lost.  The person sitting right up here — “Donald Trump lost on the ban.”  Yeah, I did.  And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.  And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.  Didn’t want to take it that far.  But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too. The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we’re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.  And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.  Thousands.  They’re out of this country.  We take them out by the thousands.  And they are monsters. Okay.  Do you have any questions?  Yeah.  John, go ahead. Q    Mr. President — ( ).   Were you saying I was prepared? Q    With the microphone and prepared for questions.   Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.  I couldn’t believe you said that. Q    (Laughs.)  No, no, no.     People don’t like saying that. Q    You were prepared for questions.   I am prepared.  I’m always prepared. Q    A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that’s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.  How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?   Yeah.  So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.  Some of them haven’t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.  I was speaking to a couple of them.  They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.  I said, “What were you going to use it for?”  And I won’t go into details, but it didn’t sound too important to me. Plus, if you think, I’ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.  And we’re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.  And under the previous administration, our military was depleted — badly depleted.  And they weren’t spending — I mean, they had a much less — they had a much smaller amount of money. So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion — and this year, it’s going to be pretty big too, because there’s few things more important than our military.  You know, I’m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.  It was very badly depleted.  And we’re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.  We have — we’ll soon have a military like we’ve never had before. But when you think about the kind of numbers you’re talking about — so you have $700 billion, $716 billion — when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall — which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.  And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.  And that’s part of it, too. We’re taking a lot of money from that realm also.  But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we’re asking for. Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  ABC.  Not NBC.  I like ABC a little bit more — not much.  Come on, ABC.  Not much.  Pretty close. Q    Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?  Marco Rubio has made this point.   Well, not too many people.  Yeah.  Not too many people have said that.  But the courts will determine that. Look, I expect to be sued.  I shouldn’t be sued.  Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.  And then other people say, “Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?”  We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.  It’s an invasion.  We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it’s very hard to stop.  With a wall, it would be very easy. So I think that we will be very successful in court.  I think it’s clear.  And the people that say we create precedent — well, what do you have?  Fifty-six?  There are a lot of times — well, that’s creating precedent.  And many of those are far less important than having a border.  If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country. You know, we fight — before I got here — we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don’t create a border for our own country. So I think what will happen is, sadly, we’ll be sued, and sadly, it’ll go through a process.  And, happily, we’ll win — I think. Go ahead.  Let’s go.  Let’s hear it, NBC.  Come on. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, “The whole concept of executive order, it’s not the way the country is supposed to be run.”  You said, “You’re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.”  Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you’re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown?   No.  Look, I went through Congress.  I made a deal.  I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn’t supposed to get one dollar — not one dollar.  “He’s not going to get one dollar.”  Well, I got $1.4 billion.  But I’m not happy with it.  I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things — port of entries, lots of different things.  The purchase of drug equipment.  More than we were even requesting. In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.  Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don’t know what to do with it we have so much money.  But on the wall, they skimped. So I did — I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.  I could do the wall over a longer period of time.  I didn’t need to do this.  But I’d rather do it much faster.  And I don’t have to do it for the election.  I’ve already done a lot of wall, for the election — 2020.  And the only reason we’re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they’re not going to be able to do.  And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense. And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that’s all. Okay.  Yes, ma’am, go ahead. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.   Thank you. Q    Roberta Rampton from Reuters.  I wanted to ask about China.  Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1?   Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?  I mean, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.  And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel — much of it comes from China — at 25 percent.  Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they’re building plants all over the United States.  It’s a beautiful thing.  And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel. You know, you can do without certain industries.  Our country cannot do without steel. So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.  And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.  And I haven’t even started. Now, here’s the thing: If we make a deal, they won’t have to pay.  You know, it’ll be a whole different story.  They won’t be paying that, but we’ll have a fair deal.  There won’t be intellectual property theft.  There won’t be so many other things that have gone on.  And no other President has done this.  No other — you know, we didn’t have a deal with China.  You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made — probably even worse than NAFTA, if that’s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.  It was a total disaster for our country. And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific — a great deal.  And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico — that’s United States, Mexico, Canada — that’s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.  And nobody wants to talk about that.  Because we’re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal. Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they’ll say — one of the things I’m thinking of doing — this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they’ve built over the last two years — which is a lot — and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, “What a lousy deal; that’s a terrible deal.” Like, ZTE, I got a billion — more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.  And the Democrats said, “Oh, should’ve gotten more.”  When I made that deal, I said, “This is incredible.”  I just got — I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.  They had to change their top management.  But they had to pay over a billion dollars.  I said, “What a deal.”  It took like a week.  And the Democrats didn’t even know there was a problem with ZTE. I’m the one that find them.  I’m the one that settled it.  Over a billion dollars.  And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.  And we made a deal — paid — like, in a short period of time. The Democrats went out and said, “Oh, they should’ve done better.”  So what I’m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.  And we’ll all go down together, and what we’ll do is we’ll negotiate.  I’ll put them in the room and let them speak up.  Because any deal I make with China, if it’s the great — it’s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I’m not going to have a deal.  It’s a very simple. But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, “Oh, it should’ve been better.  It should’ve been better.”  And you know what?  That’s not acceptable to me.  So I’m thinking about doing something very different.  I don’t think it’s ever been — I just don’t want to be second-guessed.  But that’s not even second-guess; that’s called politics.  Sadly, I’d probably do the same thing to them, okay? But any deal I make toward the end, I’m going to bring Schumer — at least offer him — and Pelosi.  I’m going to say, “Please join me on the deal.” And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.  Please stand up, Bill.    Such an easy job he’s got.  He’s got the easiest job in government.  Thank you and congratulations.  That was a great vote yesterday.  Thank you very much. Q    Mr. President —   Yes, go ahead.  Go ahead. Q    In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would’ve preferred that this be done.  Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?  And —   Well, I’m learning.  I mean, I am learning.  Don’t forget, it’s not like I’ve done this for — a senator came into my office and said, “Sir, I’ve been running for office for 30 years.  I’ve won seven out of seven.  I did lose a couple when I was younger.”  I said, “Well, I’ve won one out of one.  But, you know, I never did politics before.  Now I do politics.”  I will tell you, I’m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster. Q    Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir?   But I’ve learned — who? Q    Speaker Ryan.   Let’s not talk about it. Q    Okay.   What difference does it make?  But they should have pushed it faster.  They should have pushed it harder.  And they didn’t.  They didn’t. If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.  In the meantime, I’ve built a lot of wall.  I have a lot of money, and I’ve built a lot of wall.  But it would’ve been nice to have gotten done.  And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that’s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform — not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things. We have a real problem.  We have catch-and-release.  You catch a criminal and you have to release them.  We have so many other things.  You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members — because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle — they’re all in. You know what happened on the West Side Highway.  That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured — nobody talks about that — horribly — like, loss of legs and arms — going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.  He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.  It’s called chain migration. And then you have the lottery.  It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery.  It’s common sense.  If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want.  The lottery system is a disaster.  I’m stuck with it. Q    Mr. President, could you tell us —   It should have — wait.  It should have never happened.  Okay. Q    Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency?   I would talk about it.  Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.  Not of me.  If I changed my views, he wouldn’t be with me. Rush Limbaugh — I think he’s a great guy.  Here’s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.  Try doing that sometime.  For three hours, he speaks.  He’s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.  I mean, this guy is unbelievable.  Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.  Taking calls is easy.  “Okay, I’ll answer this one.  I’ll answer that one.”  He goes for three hours, and he’s got an audience that’s fantastic. Q    Should they be —   Wait — Q    Should they be deciding policy, sir?    They don’t decide policy.  In fact, if I went opposite — I mean, they have somebody — Ann Coulter.  I don’t know her.  I hardly know her.  I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.  But the press loves saying “Ann Coulter.”  Probably, if I did speak to her, she’d be very nice.  I just don’t have the time to speak to her.  I would speak to her; I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, “Donald Trump.”  And the two people that asked her that question smiled.  They said, “You’re kidding, aren’t you?”  “Nope.  Donald Trump.” So I like her, but she’s off the reservation.  But anybody that knows her understands that.  But I haven’t spoken to her.  I don’t follow her.  I don’t talk to her.  But the press loves to bring up the name “Ann Coulter.”  And you know what?  I think she’s fine.  I think she’s good.  But I just don’t speak to her. Laura has been great.  Laura Ingraham.  Tucker Carlson has been great.  I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.  I have some on MSNBC.  The other day, they did a great report of me.  I said, “Where the hell did that come from?”  I think it was the only one in over a year. So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen — 52 percent in the polls.  It’s my highest poll number.  And people get what we’re doing.  They get it.  They really get it.  And I’m honored by it. Yes.  Jim Acosta. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what’s happening at the border — calling it an “invasion,” talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on — and yet there’s a lot of reporting out there, there’s a lot of crime data out there, there’s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low —   That’s because of us.  But it’s still — Q    — that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels —   Excuse me.  It’s still massive numbers of crossings. Q    — that shows undocumented criminals — or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.  What do you say —   You don’t really believe that stat, do you?  Do you really believe that stat? Q    What do you — well, let me ask you this —   Take a look at our federal prisons. Q    I believe in facts and statistics and data, but —   Okay?  Any more?  Quick, let’s go. Q    Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you’re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn’t get it through other ways?   I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?  Do you think I’m creating something? Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.  Okay?   Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.  You’re CNN.  You’re fake news.  You have an agenda.  The numbers that you gave are wrong. Take a look at our federal prison population.  See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.  Just see.  Go ahead and see.  It’s a fake question. Yes.  Go ahead. Q    Can I ask a follow-up? Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics — numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government — show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most —   There’s not violence on the border? Q    There’s not as much violence as —   Oh, really? Q    Let me — wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait —   You had 26 people killed — Q    Let me finish the question, please.  Let me finish the question, please.   Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border — Q    I understand what you’re — I understand what you’re saying.   — a mile away from where I went. Q    I was there.  I understand.  That’s not the question.  The question is —   Do we forget about that? Q    No, I’m not forgetting about it.  I’m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down.   Okay. Q    So what do you base your facts on?   Okay, let me — come on, let’s go.  Sort of — sort of — Q    And, secondly —   No, no.  You get one.  You get one.  Ready? Q    Well, the second question is —   Just sit down.  Wait.  Sit down.  Sit down. Q    Could you please answer it?   Sit down.  You get one question. I get my numbers from a lot of sources — like Homeland Security, primarily.  And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.  And you know what else is a disaster?  The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.  Billions and billions of dollars.  And it’s unnecessary. Q    So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying?   No, no.  I use many stats.  I use many stats. Q    Could you share those stats with us?   Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.  But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security. All right, next question. Q    And do you — wait a minute.  Just a quick follow-up.   Go ahead.  No.  Go.  Please. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to bring you back to China for a second.  The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.  The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.  Are you eyeing a possible extension — 30 days, maybe 60 days?  What is the status there?  Or is March 1st the deadline?   Yeah.  Very good question.  So it’s a very big deal.  I guess you could say it’s like — must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.  Trade with China, how big does that get?  Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.  But it’s very complicated.  There are many, many points that we’re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they’re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them. There is a possibility that I will extend the date.  And if I do that, if I see that we’re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we’re charging now.  I would not increase the tariffs. Q    Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it’s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.  Now it’s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.  What are your plans to reverse it?   Well, it’s all about growth.  But before I — Q    (Inaudible.)   — really focus on that — and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.  So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.  Combine them all.  So you can’t be talking about that.  But I talk about it because I consider it very important. But first, I have to straighten out the military.  The military was depleted.  And if we don’t have a strong military — that hopefully we won’t have to use because it’s strong — if we don’t have a strong military, you don’t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.  So I have to straighten out the military.  That’s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.  But growth will straighten it out. You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.  Everybody said, “What happened?”  Well, what’s happening is growth.  But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.  And we have no choice but to straighten out our military. Q    Is growth the only answer, sir, or is ( )?   Yes, ma’am, go ahead. Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  On North Korea — back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement.   Yes. Q    I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.  And then —   A lot. Q    — are we going to be seeing anything concrete —   A lot has been accomplished.  Okay. Q    — on denuclearization.   Yeah.  A lot has been accomplished.  We’re dealing with them, we’re talking to them. When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.  And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.  It was supposed to be 15 minutes.  As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that. And I said, “What’s the biggest problem?”  He said, “By far, North Korea.”  And I don’t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.  I think he was ready to go to war.  In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.  And where are we now?  No missiles.  No rockets.  No nuclear testing.  We’ve learned a lot. But much more importantly than all of it — much more important — much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.  I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.  And I’ve done a job.  In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.  He said, “I have nominated you…” or “Respectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.”  I said, “Thank you.”  Many other people feel that way too.  I’ll probably never get it, but that’s okay. They gave it to Obama.  He didn’t even know what he got it for.  He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.  He said, “Oh, what did I get it for?”  With me, I probably will never get it. But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the s  of perhaps 3 million people.  Nobody talk about that.  They don’t talk about that.  Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.  And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, “Please, please.”  And I thought — I said, “No, it can’t happen.  What are you talking about?”  “No, they’re going to get…”  And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into — to really — to really do big destruction.  And I put out a statement that “you better not do it.” And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn’t attack.  Or they’re doing it surgically, at least.  Saved a lot of people.  We do a lot of good work.  This administration does a tremendous job, and we don’t get credit for it.  But I think the people understand what we do. So Prime Minister Abe gave me — I mean, it’s the most beautiful five letter — five-page letter.  Nobel Prize.  He sent it to them.  You know why?  Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.  And they had alarms going off; you know that.  Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.  I did that. And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.  Fire and fury.  Total annihilation.  “My button is bigger than yours” and “my button works.”  Remember that?  You don’t remember that.  And people said, “Trump is crazy.”  And you know what it ended up being?  A very good relationship.  I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.  Nobody else would have done that. The Obama administration couldn’t have done it.  Number one, they probably wouldn’t have done it.  And number two, they didn’t have the capability to do it. So I just want to thank everybody.  I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.    Bill, good luck.  A tremendous reputation.  I know you’ll do a great job.  Thank you very much.  And thank you, everybody.  Thank you very much.  Thank you."
"Thank you very much.  Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, ambassadors, and world leaders: Seven decades of history have passed through this hall, in all of their richness and drama.  Where I stand, the world has heard from presidents and premiers at the height of the Cold War.  We have seen the foundation of nations.  We have seen the ringleaders of revolution.  We have beheld saints who inspired us with hope, rebels who stirred us with passion, and heroes who emboldened us with courage — all here to share plans, proposals, visions, and ideas on the world’s biggest stage. Like those who met us before, our time is one of great contests, high stakes, and clear choices.  The essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief.  It is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations who want only to rule themselves. I have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty, independence, and self-government above all.  The United States, after having spent over two and a half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military, is also, by far, the world’s most powerful nation.  Hopefully, it will never have to use this power. Americans know that in a world where others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, in might, and in spirit.  That is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are. Like my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture, and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength. The free world must embrace its national foundations.  It must not attempt to erase them or replace them. Looking around and all over this large, magnificent planet, the truth is plain to see: If you want freedom, take pride in your country.  If you want democracy, hold on to your sovereignty.  And if you want peace, love your nation.  Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first. The future does not belong to globalists.  The future belongs to patriots.  The future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique. It is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting program of national renewal.  In everything we do, we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens. Thanks to our pro-growth economic policies, our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century.  Fueled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts, jobs are being produced at a historic rate.  Six million Americans have been added to the employment rolls in under three years. Last month, African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded. We are marshaling our nation’s vast energy abundance, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.  Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years. As we rebuild the unrivaled might of the American military, we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden, which the United States has borne in the past. At the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious campaign to reform international trade.  For decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith.  As jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In America, the result was 4.2 million lost manufacturing jobs and $15 trillion in trade deficits over the last quarter century.  The United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice.  Our goal is simple: We want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal. We have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Tomorrow, I will join Prime Minister Abe of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal. As the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union, I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries.  We are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal. The most important difference in America’s new approach on trade concerns our relationship with China.  In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization.  Our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us, and for private property and for the rule of law.  Two decades later, this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong. Not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms, it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping, forced technology transfers, and the theft of intellectual property and also trade secrets on a grand scale. As just one example, I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company, Micron Technology, at the White House.  Micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics.  To advance the Chinese government’s five-year economic plan, a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole Micron’s designs, valued at up to $8.7 billion.  Soon, the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical product, and Micron was banned from selling its own goods in China.  But we are seeking justice. The United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO.  This is happening to other countries all over the globe. The World Trade Organization needs drastic change.  The second-largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a “developing country” in order to game the system at others’ expense. For years, these abuses were tolerated, ignored, or even encouraged.  Globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests. But as far as America is concerned, those days are over.  To confront these unfair practices, I placed massive tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese-made goods.  Already, as a result of these tariffs, supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations, and billions of dollars are being paid to our Treasury. The American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement that would be beneficial for both countries.  But as I have made very clear, I will not accept a bad deal for the American people. As we endeavor to stabilize our relationship, we’re also carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong.  The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty, made with the British and registered with the United Nations, in which China commits to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system, and democratic ways of life.  How China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future.  We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader. The United States does not seek conflict with any other nation.  We desire peace, cooperation, and mutual gain with all.  But I will never fail to defend America’s interests. One of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran.  The regime’s record of death and destruction is well known to us all.  Not only is Iran the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism, but Iran’s leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen. At the same time, the regime is squandering the nation’s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them.  We must never allow this to happen. To stop Iran’s path to nuclear weapons and missiles, I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which has very little time remaining, did not allow inspection of important sites, and did not cover ballistic missiles. Following our withdrawal, we have implemented severe economic sanctions on the country.  Hoping to free itself from sanctions, the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression.  In response to Iran’s recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, we just imposed the highest level of sanctions on Iran’s central bank and sovereign wealth fund. All nations have a duty to act.  No responsible government should subsidize Iran’s bloodlust.  As long as Iran’s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted; they will be tightened.  Iran’s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches. For 40 years, the world has listened to Iran’s rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created.  They conduct ritual chants of “Death to America” and traffic in monstrous anti-Semitism.  Last year the country’s Supreme Leader stated, “Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor…that has to be removed and eradicated: it is possible and it will happen.”  America will never tolerate such anti-Semitic hate. Fanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures.  Thankfully, there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing economic opportunity.  That is why it is so important to have full, normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors.  Only a relationship built on common interests, mutual respect, and religious tolerance can forge a better future. Iran’s citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty, ending corruption, and increasing jobs — not stealing their money to fund a massacre abroad and at home. After four decades of failure, it is time for Iran’s leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries, and focus on building up their own country.  It is time for Iran’s leaders to finally put the Iranian people first. America is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuinely seek peace and respect. Many of America’s closest friends today were once our gravest foes.  The United States has never believed in permanent enemies.  We want partners, not adversaries.  America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace. For this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula. I have told Kim Jong Un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realize that promise, North Korea must denuclearize. Around the world, our message is clear: America’s goal is lasting, America’s goal is harmony, and America’s goal is not to go with these endless wars — wars that never end. With that goal in mind, my administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan.  Unfortunately, the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks.  And we will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism, and we will never stop working to make peace a reality. Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region.  In that mission, one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration, which undermines prosperity, rips apart societies, and empowers ruthless criminal cartels. Mass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved: the sending countries and the depleted countries.  And they become depleted very fast, but their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste. The receiving countries are overburdened with more migrants than they can responsibly accept.  And the migrants themselves are exploited, assaulted, and abused by vicious coyotes.  Nearly one third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way.  Yet, here in the United States and around the world, there is a growing cottage industry of radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling.  These groups encourage illegal migration and demand erasure of national borders. Today, I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice: Your policies are not just.  Your policies are cruel and evil.  You are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men, women, and children.  You put your own false sense of virtue before the lives, wellbeing, and [of] countless innocent people.  When you undermine border security, you are undermining human rights and human dignity. Many of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration.  Each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders, and so, of course, does our country.  Today, we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling, end human trafficking, and put these criminal networks out of business for good. To our country, I can tell you sincerely: We are working closely with our friends in the region — including Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Panama — to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people.  I would like to thank President López Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we are receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our southern border.  Mexico is showing us great respect, and I respect them in return. The U.S., we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration.  To anyone considering crossings of our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers.  Do not pay the coyotes.  Do not put yourself in danger.  Do not put your children in danger.  Because if you make it here, you will not be allowed in; you will be promptly returned home.  You will not be released into our country.  As long as I am President of the United States, we will enforce our laws and protect our borders. For all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere, our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation.  Our region is full of such incredible promise: dreams waiting to be built and national destinies for all.  And they are waiting also to be pursued. Throughout the hemisphere, there are millions of hardworking, patriotic young people eager to build, innovate, and achieve.  But these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandon their homes in search of a life elsewhere.  We want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace. In that mission, we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression, such as those in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. According to a recent report from the U.N. Human Rights Council, women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food.  Over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners.  Modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings. The dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet, protected by Cuban bodyguards, hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela’s oil wealth to sustain its own corrupt communist rule. Since I last spoke in this hall, the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela. To the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare: Please know that all of America is united behind you.  The United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered.  We are watching the Venezuela situation very closely.  We await the day when democracy will be restored, when Venezuela will be free, and when liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere. One of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism.  It’s the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies. Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation.  Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class. Today, I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home: America will never be a socialist country. In the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people.  Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues in this country.  These totalitarian ideologies, combined with modern technology, have the power to excise  new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination. For this reason, the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security.  We urge every nation present to do the same. Freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected, both abroad and from within.  We must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control.  Even in free nations, we see alarming signs and new challenges to liberty. A small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say.  A permanent political class is openly disdainful, dismissive, and defiant of the will of the people.  A faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule.  Media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions, and values. In the United States, my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.  A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people, and a free people must never, ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing, canceling, or blacklisting their own neighbors. As we defend American values, we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity.  For this reason, my administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality, and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish, jail, or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation. We are also championing the role of women in our societies.  Nations that empower women are much wealthier, safer, and much more politically stable.  It is therefore vital not only to a nation’s prosperity, but also is vital to its national security, to pursue women’s economic development. Guided by these principles, my administration launched the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiatives.  The W-GDP is first-ever government-wide approach to women’s economic empowerment, working to ensure that women all over the planet have the legal right to own and inherit property, work in the same industries as men, travel freely, and access credit and institutions. Yesterday, I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an ironclad American commitment: protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom.  This fundamental right is under growing threat around the world.  Hard to believe, but 80 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed.  Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote freedom of worship and religion.  We want and support religious liberty for all. Americans will also never tire of defending innocent life.  We are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand, right up until the moment of delivery.  Global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life.  Like many nations here today, we in America believe that every child — born and unborn — is a sacred gift from God. There is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries  to trample on the rights of our citizens, including the right to self-defense.  That is why, this year, I announced that we will never ratify the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens.  The United States will always uphold our constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  We will always uphold our Second Amendment. The core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America’s founding documents.  Our nation’s Founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others. Tyranny advances under many names and many theories, but it always comes down to the desire for domination.  It protects not the interests of many, but the privilege of few. Our Founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse.  They chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation: a proud and fiercely independent people. The true good of a nation can only be pursued by those who love it: by citizens who are rooted in its history, who are nourished by its culture, committed to its values, attached to its people, and who know that its future is theirs to build or theirs to lose.  Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can. Liberty is only preserved, sovereignty is only secured, democracy is only sustained, greatness is only realized, by the will and devotion of patriots.  In their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression, the inspiration to forge legacy, the goodwill to seek friendship, and the bravery to reach for peace.  Love of our nations makes the world better for all nations. So to all the leaders here today, join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have, the most profound contribution anyone can make: Lift up your nations.  Cherish your culture.  Honor your histories.  Treasure your citizens. Make your countries strong, and prosperous, and righteous.  Honor the dignity of your people, and nothing will be outside of your reach. When our nations are greater, the future will be brighter, our people will be happier, and our partnerships will be stronger. With God’s help, together we will cast off the enemies of liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity.  We will set new standards of living and reach new heights of human achievement. We will rediscover old truths, unravel old mysteries, and make thrilling new breakthroughs.  And we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before. My fellow leaders, the path to peace and progress, and freedom and justice, and a better world for all humanity, begins at home. Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the nations of the world.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much."
"Hello, everybody. Well, thank you very much. And good afternoon. As President, my highest and most solemn duty is the defense of our nation and its citizens. Last night, at my direction, the United States military successfully executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number-one terrorist anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. Under my leadership, America’s policy is unambiguous: To terrorists who harm or intend to harm any American, we will find you; we will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, service members, all Americans, and our allies. For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its ruthless Quds Force — under Soleimani’s leadership — has targeted, injured, and murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen. The recent attacks on US targets in Iraq, including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of Soleimani. Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani’s many atrocities, and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over. Soleimani has been perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years. What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protestors in Iran, where more than a thousand innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government. We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. They are a remarkable people, with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime’s aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end, and it must end now. The future belongs to the people of Iran — those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation — not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad. The United States has the best military by far, anywhere in the world. We have best intelligence in the world. If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. And that, in particular, refers to Iran. Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently, American Special Operations Forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi. The world is a safer place without these monsters. America will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world. Thank you. God bless you. God bless our great military. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"My fellow Americans: Tonight, I want to speak with you about our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large-scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond, and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans. To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and in South Korea. And, as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening. Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments, and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus. Additionally, last week, I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments, and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly, day by day. We are moving very quickly. The vast majority of Americans: The risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid nonessential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with the largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings. Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts—and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often-used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home. To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taking emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief. Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way. This is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world. However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low-interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments, without interest or penalties, for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy. Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health, and safety of the American people. I will always put the wellbeing of America first. If we are vigilant—and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will—we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. Hide Transcript"
"Thank you very much, everyone. My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We’re speaking with the governors and representatives. FEMA is already on its way, and they got there—as soon as we heard the word, I said, “Get out there.” So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does. It’s, really, something very special.  So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we’re with you all the way. It’s a tough deal. That was a bad, bed level five. That was a bad group. That’s as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes. Something that’s something incredible, the power—the horrible, destructive power. America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide. Flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It’s been incredible what they’ve done. You looked at the charts, and the charts are—and the models from early on—predictions were 100  and 120,000 people look like. If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we’re going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it’s still just a horrible thing all over the world. A hundred and eighty-four countries. This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further. Thank you very much. Tony, please.  And, by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. The travel ban was done earlier.  And if you look at statistics—I happened to write a couple of them down. If you look at statistics—so, on January 6th—that’s long before the dates you’re talking about—there were—CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice, before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That’s on January 6th. This is all documented. Because we have so much fake news, I like to document things. January 6th, long before the dates we’re talking about, CDC issued travel notice to Wuhan—for Wuhan. On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don’t have any cases. So there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a level one travel notice health—for health, while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I’m supposed to close down the economy—the greatest economy in the history of the world—and we don’t have one case confirmed in the United States. That’s January 11th. On January 17th, the CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn’t a case, and the fake news is saying, “Oh, he didn’t act fast enough.” Well, you remember what happened. Because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by Sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats and some others—not too many others, actually. So that—by the media, definitely. Now, on January 21st—this is long before the time we’re talking, because when Tony is talking, I believe he’s talking about the end of February. On January 21st, okay—still early—there was one case of the virus. At that time, we called it the “Wuhan virus,” right? Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We have one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from you people. On January 21st, the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That’s why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States. You know they used the ad, “There’s only one person…” That statement was made at that time. One case. In the whole United States, one case. I’m supposed to shut down the government? The biggest—the biggest economy in the history of the world. “Shut it down. We have one case.” Seven cases were on January 31st. Now, on January 21st, there was a case. Not one person had died. You heard that, Steve, right? Not one person. So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world—bigger than China’s, by a lot—right?—because of what we’ve done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we’ve ever had; the highest employment numbers; the best employment numbers; best unemployment numbers also. The best of everything. So, on January 31st—think of it—not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, Jon. I don’t think you’ll find any. This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news—which doesn’t mean anything to me because they don’t tell the truth. But CDC reported: January 31st, not one person has died. And I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died, and I issued. You can’t get earlier than that. So we have nobody died, and I said, “China, you can’t come in. I’m sorry.” Because I saw what was going on. It wasn’t so much what I was told; it was that I saw what was going on and I didn’t like it. But I didn’t speak to Tony about it. Didn’t speak to very many people about it. I didn’t like it. So what did I do? Ready? January 31st: In the United States, not one person had died because of the—again, the Wuhan virus. So I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died, and I got brutalized over it by the press because I was way too early; I shouldn’t have done it. Brutalized by the press. But, you know, sort of—I’ve been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics. But I guess I’m doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I’m the President of the United States, despite the things that are said. So, then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats and the media called “xenophobic.” Now, Joe Biden said, “He’s a racist.” He called me a racist because I said, “We’re shutting down entry from China. We’re shutting it down.” He called me xenophobic, and he called me racist and other things. Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a state-—it wasn’t him; he didn’t write it. I’m sure he doesn’t even know that it was issued. But the people from his campaign—who are smart. The people that write those little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good. Not the best, but they’re not bad. But they issued a statement, saying that Joe Biden agrees that the Pres-—that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now, he did that. Now, he issued it on Friday night. We’ve all heard about that, Jon—Friday nights, right? In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday night. Okay?  So he did—he did it pretty late. I mean, you know, like at 11 o’clock in the evening or something. You know, that’s pretty late. Anyway. So Joe Biden issued—and it’s one of those things. But, in February, Nancy Pelosi said we should come to Chinatown. This is late February. “Come to Chinatown. We think it’s very safe. Come here. Let’s all have the big parade—Chinatown parade.” Probably referring to San Francisco. And that’s it. But I took this action early. And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It’s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday—hopefully in five years, when I’m not here—those papers are all going out of business because nobody is going to want to read them. But now they like them because they write about me. Now, with that, I have a couple of interesting—we have a few clips that we’re just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you’ll find them interesting. And then we’ll answer some questions. I’ll ask you some questions because you’re so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we’re going to get back onto the reason we’re here, which is the success we’re having. Okay? Please, you could put it on. Thank you. ( ) So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors—including Democratic or “Democrat,” as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn’t want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it’s—you know, it’s very sad when people write false stories like, in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from the New York Times, which is a highly—I mean, if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they’ll end up going out of business. So it’s too bad. But we could have given you—you saw the statements. We have hundreds of statements. Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors. And if you look, they were all saying, “We need ventilators. We need…” You don’t hear “ventilators” anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, “You’re asking for too many. You don’t need that.” And, in all fairness, these two people right here—Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci—they said, “I don’t think they need that many ventilators.” And I said, “I agree.” At one point—and I’m not knocking New York for this, but they were asking—you remember?—40,000 ventilators. And that’s more than they have all over the country. And we got them a lot of ventilators, and nobody has complained. We got them, as you know, beautiful—we built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, “You know what? You don’t have to build a second hospital.” Because good news is happening. They’re not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one; it was perfect. We’re getting—we’re just starting the other. I called him up. I said, “Do you think we should build the second one? I don’t think you’re going to need it.” He said, “Let me get back.” He got back. We didn’t need it. With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done. And we built 2,900 incredible beds. Incredible. Then we make it—we made it COVID—and—or, to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, and—which was a lot of work. We had to change the ductwork. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work. And we had it—but they never really had too much use for it. And they called also—Mayor de Blasio, rightfully, he called. He said, “Would it be possible to get more medical help?” So, now, not only are we building facilities, we’re—they’re asking us for help because they’re unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help. Then, when the Javits Center wasn’t used much—and then, as you know, the Mercy—and we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort, and we made them both—Los Angeles and New York—we made them COVID-adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn’t get almost any people sent there. They didn’t need them at the beginning because they didn’t need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything. And what we did was like an incredible job, but they didn’t need them. It turned out—they were there. We were ready. You know the expression? They have an expression: “Ready, willing, and able.” We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What—what FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did. So I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, “Could you help us even more with medical personnel?” And we sent—I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts. Real experts. And I got a call from the mayor and he said, “I want to tell you: Incredible—these people are incredible.” He said, “They lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I’ve ever seen.” He’s—he was unbelievable, what he said. It was really appreciated. And I let them know that. I let the military people—he said, “They went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.” We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories, you—nobody—nobody acknowledges this. And it doesn’t have to be acknowledged, from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors, nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA—all these people, they’ve done this incredible job. And they shouldn’t be abused because—you take a look at what’s happened. Nobody is asking for ventilators, except outside of our country. Outside of our country, they’re calling me—every country. They’re calling me. So many countries. And I’m going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody is asking for ventilators. Nobody is asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks. The job they’ve done is incredible. With all of that being said, I’m getting along very well with governors. And if I wouldn’t, Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10. I said, “How was it?” He said, “It’s a 10.” He was one of my expressions, actually. But he said it was like a 10. And I’m sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren’t supposed to be. But you were sitting in somebody’s office listening to it, because every time we have these—and, you know, and you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good. But there wasn’t a raised voice. There wasn’t even a statement of like, “We think you should do this or that.” I heard it was, like, just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They’ll say, “I thought that somebody maybe slightly raised…” Didn’t even raise a voice. My only point of saying this, because I want to get back to why we’re here: The press has not treated these incredible people who’ve done such a great job, they haven’t treated them fairly. They’re way off. We were way ahead of schedule. And remember this—because the Times story was a fake—but everything—remember this: Everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, it would have been—you would have been critic-—if I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized—you know, criticized for being way too early. So, with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I’ve educated a lot of people as to the press. And I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, Jon, there’d be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work—and I don’t mind being criticized, but not when they’re wrong. Not when people have done a great job. Yes.  That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by—we just put some clips together.  I could give you—I’ll bet you I have over 100 more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just—oh, we have far better than that. That’s nothing compared to some of them.  Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours.  Because we’re getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They’re saying what a great job we’re doing, and the media—these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York. Look, in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators—we’re going to be probably—we didn’t—they didn’t have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of—thousands, but we got them a tremendous number of ventilator. You don’t hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I’m happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don’t need them. That’s good news, not bad news. I’m—you know, I’m not saying, “Gee, I wish more people were there.” I don’t want more people there. We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort. And the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all—the coronavirus. It was not supposed to be for that at all. They called, they said, “Could we have it?” That was a number of weeks ago. We said, “We don’t think you need it, but if you need it, we’ll do it.” Then they said, “Could you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?” We said, “If it’s necessary, we will.” And we did. There were military personnel. That’s the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to, in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery. They’re great people, the military people. And we pieced that together—I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in house. Steve?  I wouldn’t use the word “produced.” All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don’t think that’s going to work. It’s not going to have any impact. But just think of it: You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country. Some people wish we never closed it down. Now, if we didn’t, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people. You know, interestingly—so I’m—I’m against that. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down —  Well—well, look, governors should have had ventilators; they chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven’t heard—other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.” They got the ventilators. You don’t have that anymore. And the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we’ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2,000 in New York, which you don’t, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We’re ready to rock. This was a great—this was a great military—and beyond that—operation. Let’s get back to the regular. Shouldn’t we get back to the regular? We could talk about this, but all I’m doing is this: I could have given you—like, those are four or five clips that we just played for you. I could have given you hundreds of people—I mean, Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors, singing praises. He says, “Look…” You know, the question was asked in a negative way. He said, “Look, I know what you want to say but—want me to say, but he’s been really good. It’s hard for me to say that. In fact, it’s impossible for me to say it.” Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. I have many clips from many—I have some clips from Anthony, that I didn’t want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say, when I closed the country to China, when I closed the—the China ban, whatever you want to call it—Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don’t want to put words in Anthony’s mouth, by the way, and I like him. Today, I walk in and I hear I’m going to fire him. I’m not firing—I think he’s a wonderful guy.  I retweeted somebody. I don’t know. They said “fire.” It doesn’t matter.  Yeah, I notice everything.  No, no, that’s somebody’s opinion. All that is is an opinion.  No, I was called about that. I said, “I’m not firing him.” In fact, if you ask your friends in the office—in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that. And I said, “No, I like him. I think he’s terrific.” Because this was a person’s view. Not everybody is happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody. But I will tell you, we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we’ve done—nobody has ever done a job like this. We have 50 governors—and territories, by the way. People don’t ever mention that we have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats, and they can’t find anything to complain about. And honestly, many of them didn’t do their jobs. I’ll let you know someday—let’s see what happens—but I may let you know who’s not doing their job. I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don’t know what they’re doing. But we help some of the ones that don’t know what they’re doing. They should have had their own stockpiles. And now, if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators. The hardest thing is a ventilator, because it’s expensive, it takes a while to get. We got them, and nobody believed we did. Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many. And we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said—you said very strongly that they just don’t need that many. You said they don’t need that many beds—Deborah. So that’s it.  Steve, go ahead.  Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don’t know what it is exactly. But if I put somebody’s opinion up—you know, I don’t mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing. But I want it to be honest controversy. Now, when I got a call—I got a call not very quickly; nobody, you know, saw that as being any big deal—they said, “How are you doing with Dr. Fauci?” I said, “I’m doing great.” And I didn’t talk to Dr. Fauci, even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did.  And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did.  Here’s the thing. No, no. What he really is saying though: “But how could you have done it?” Look, I just went over stats with you. Right here. Right here. How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America?” “Oh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have?” “None.” How many deaths do we have?” “None.” January 17th—go back another week. On January 17th—this is 10 days before I did the—little bit less than 10 days before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe. And a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do, because you look at Spain—and, by the way, we’re doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low, and per capita we’re very low. We’re doing very well. But how do you close up the United States of America? So, on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths. And no—no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I’m supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases?  I closed down from China.  Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And, by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them. Okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would have said, “Let’s ride it out.” Now, I’ll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that. And I did this last time: Cut it in half. Don’t say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half. Say a million people died—well, that’s much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half; that’s 500,000 people would have died. Now, that number we would have reached. Okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing, and our timing was very good. But here’s the one thing—and you have to say this—when you ask me, “Why didn’t you do this?”—how come when I did the ban on China and some very, very—instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown, saying, “Let’s all march. This is not going to happen”? How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks—if you call CNN a network; I don’t, personally. But we have CNN, we have many other places, and they’re all saying, “He doesn’t need to do it. He doesn’t need to do it.” All I’m saying is this: How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when, on January 17th, you have no cases and no death; when on January 21st, you have one case and no death? One case. Think of it. Now, we’re supposed to close down the country? But here’s what happened: When, on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, “You don’t need the ban. You…” He didn’t go crazy. Like, he has—he didn’t even know what the hell the ban was. But he—so he didn’t go crazy. But he did say —  He did call me xenophobic.  Wait a minute. He called me xenophobic; he called me a racist because—he has since apologized and he said I did the right thing. So when you say, “Why didn’t you do this?” Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that.  You’re so—you’re so —  You’re so disgraceful. It’s so disgraceful the way you say that.  Let me just—listen.  I just went over it.  I just went over it.  Nobody thought we should do it. And when I did it —  You know what we did?  You know what we did?  What do you do—what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States when you —  Excuse me. You reported it: zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th.  January. I said in January.  On January 30th —  A lot.  A lot. And, in fact, we’ll give you a list—what we did. In fact, part of it was up there. We did a lot.  Look. Look, you know you’re a fake. You know that. Your whole network—the way you cover it—is fake. And most of you—and not all of you—but the people are wise to you. That’s why you have a lower—a lower approval rating than you’ve ever had before, times probably three.  And when you ask me that questions —  Let me ask you this: Why didn’t Biden—why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?  Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job.  Now, I could’ve—I could’ve kept it open. And I could’ve done what some countries are doing. They’re getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead. We’ve done this right. And we really—we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn’t cover it the way it should be. Go ahead. One more question. Steve, go ahead.  Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we’re going to get into that in a minute. We’re going to just finish this up. We’re going to tell you about other things that we’ve done right. But I will say this: Had we said, “Let’s just keep going and let’s not do a closing”—whether it’s 2.2 that they, at one point, predicted as an outside or 1.6 at a lower number; you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000; take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster. So, the minimum number was 100,000. And I think—I feel pretty good that we’re going to be substantially below, Anthony, the 100,000. And I hope we will. All right. So, today, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot, by the way—which you didn’t like to talk about—in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received, today, 1,300 additional ventilators. Now, we’re probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big, and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We’re ready to—we’re ready to rock. The contracts are with General Electric, Hillrom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire, combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Philips and two other contracts with Hamilton and ZOLL. We’re adding 6,190 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile, of which we have a lot already—thousands—close to 10,000. But this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May. And more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year. Now, we’re going to help other countries. We’re going to help states if they need it. We may help some states’ stockpile. You know, they’re supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They’re supposed to be using that. And unfortunately, most of the states weren’t there. And a lot of people didn’t want to talk about it, but they weren’t there. We will talk about it at the right time, if you want to. I—at this point, I’m more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic—anything you want to call it. We got to get past it. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators. “We need ventilators.” Because they didn’t have them. Because the states should have had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That’s not even really our responsibility. Now, if we can help, we’re going to do it. But that’s where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we’ve actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe and we really—they rose to this incredible occasion. I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought, in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the governor, I said, “Maybe we shouldn’t build that second hospital, because we don’t want to build it if you don’t need it.” He called back, he said, “I don’t think we’re going to need it.” They had 1,000 rooms, 1,000 beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn’t need the other one so we stopped it because we don’t want to waste. But we’re prepared to build thousands more should we need it. I don’t think we’re going to need it because it looks like we’re plateauing and maybe even, in many cases, coming down. In addition, we’ve ordered a total of 60 mobile decontamidation —-contamination systems. So the decontamination system from Battelle, in Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks, and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I’ve been asking from the beginning: “Why can’t we sterilize and sanitize these masks?” And it turned out we can. And there was a great company in Ohio, they sent us some great equipment, and they’re doing that now. And now we’re going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it’ll be great. It’s something that, frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago. Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge—our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks, and 4.9 million gowns. So, we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it. Now, the states—the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff. But should they need it, we are ready to give them, because we’re building up our stockpile again like crazy. Remember, I—and you saw the stories. I inherited—this administration—Mike, myself, the whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing. And I say it and I’ll say it again: Just like we didn’t have ammunition, we didn’t have medical supplies, we didn’t have ventilators, we didn’t have a lot of things that should have been had. And you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened: They didn’t want to spend the money. But we did. To date, we’ve facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week, we’ll be sending 2 million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He’s got great detail on that, and I think it’s a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock, and we have more coming. We’re further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients, including at the East Orange, New Jersey Medical Center, as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They’re ready. They’re able. They’re beautiful. Hopefully, we won’t need too many of them because, frankly, we built everything that the governors wanted. And in many cases, it’s too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution. The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus. Three million—the most of any nation. We are performing approximately 150,000 tests every single day and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus, if you look. And that’s really—and it has hit some areas—the virus—very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world. The NIH, CDC, and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We’re looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting, over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed, as we speak. In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug, remdesivir, has shown promising results—very promising—in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted emergency use authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient’s immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem. Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that—that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with Zinc—depending on your doctor’s recommendation. And it’s having some very good results, I’ll tell you. I think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it’s a lot of good things that are happening with it. A lot of good tests. Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick. And this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it’s done in a very modern way. During this difficult time, we’re also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy.  We may be asking for an extension because, obviously, they can’t be doing very much right now. They wouldn’t even be allowed to do it. So, the Census, we’re going to be asking for a delay—a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now? The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data-collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension. I don’t know that you even have to ask them. This is called “an act of God.” This is called a—a situation that has to be—they have to give in. I think 120 days isn’t nearly enough. My administration is also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill. By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion. And from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that’s very much on time and going very nicely. He’ll be speaking in a moment. And payments—these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400. That’s for a family of four. That’s something. Additionally, through our Paycheck Protection Program –which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks are taking a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it’s going rapidly. We’ve now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds because it’s really something that has been an incredible success. And they need more money to keep it going to take care of these business and keep them—keep them open. I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month, and even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. You know, we’ve been working together with a lot of for, it seems like, forever. I’ve been having many discussions with my team and top experts, and we’re very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. And that’s so important. We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration’s plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That’s what we want. We want to have our country open. We want to return to normal life. Our country is going to be open, and it’s going to be successfully opened. And we’ll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be. We’ve also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We’re actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. And we’ll be announcing them tomorrow. This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus—that’s OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations—representing many of the world’s largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets. And we have, in fact—and I think you’ve seen a big stabilization over the last couple of days. Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they’ll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. And that will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many of other—other of our big energy states. This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry. It’s a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the King of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia—both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine—a man who’s become a friend of mine: The President of Mexico showed great flexibility. President López Obrador. He showed great flexibility and—and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him. And I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal. Very historic. So we’ll see how it all goes. In this time and challenge—and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven’t been in many, many decades—we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I’m so proud of the American people. Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to happen sooner than people think. And we’re going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We’re going to be safe about it. We’re going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals. Together, we’re beating back the invisible enemy and we’re paving the way for great resurgence. Really, a great resurgence for American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They’re going to go back safely, and that’s what we want. I’d like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we—before we do this—because I know there’s an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I’ll do is I’ll ask Steve to come up—Secretary of the Treasury. You can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of questions about what’s happening. Tell them the success we’re having. Thank you very much. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. As you announced, we are very pleased that we are ahead of schedule on delivering the economic impact payments. These are what was known as the checks in the mail that we want to deliver in direct—direct deposit. This is ahead of schedule. We started processing those last Friday. We expect that over 80 million hardworking Americans will get the direct deposit by this Wednesday. And we know how important that is to all of those hardworking Americans, many of which are at home, not working at the moment. If you do not receive them by Wednesday—on Wednesday, we will be launching at IRS.gov. Click on IRS.gov, go to “Get Your Payment.” If you filed a tax return in 2018 and ’19—or ’19—have that information available. You’ll be able to ID yourself, you’ll be able to put in your direct deposit information, and within several days, we will automatically deposit the money into your account. We want to do as much of this electronically as we can. It’s very important in this day and age. It’s more secure, and you don’t have to go to the bank. If you’re a Social Security beneficiary, you do not need to do anything. You will get a direct deposit. If you have not filed and did not need to file a 2018 and ‘19 return, you can go to IRS.gov now and enter your information and authenticate yourself. So again, we are very pleased that that is ahead of schedule. I’d also like to announce the progress we’re making on the new SBA program, the PPP. Let me just remind everybody: This is a brand-new program that is now one week old. We have distributed and confirmed $230 billion of loans to over 4,600 lenders participating. That is multiples and multiples of anything that the SBA has ever done in—in one year, before. And I especially want to thank the broad-based community banks that are participating. Again, over 4,600 banks. If you haven’t had your loan processed, you will get it processed this week. As the President said, we’ve gone back to Congress and asked them for more money to make sure that every business has access to this. Let me also comment for the states. We are distributing out half the money, this week, to the states. That’s a week ahead of time. And we’ll deliver the other half of the money to the states next week. And then let me just finally comment, we’ve been very—working very closely with the Federal Reserve. Last week, we announced expanded facilities and new facilities that total $2.3 trillion of liquidity. And in particular, I’d just like to highlight a Main Street lending facility that will be for companies between one worker and 10,000 people—so mid-sized businesses—and also, a municipal facility for states and local governments to be able to access funds given the shortages that they have. So with that, I’m happy to answer any questions  You have any questions for Steve, please?  Negotiation.  We have to do—everything has to be safe. We want safe.  Well, I’ll be doing that over the next few days because we’ll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like. I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the—the biggest from every business on this council. We’re actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. And we have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But, no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we got to get our country open.  I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah.  I think eventually they will do that. And I think we’re going to—boom—I think we’re going to—I think it’s going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there’s a pent-up demand like there hasn’t been in a long time. And that’s why—and that’s why you see the stock market—I mean, to think that the stock market is at the level it is right now, with all that this world and this country has gone. And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they’ve been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I’ve seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this. And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much—you know, it was looking a little bleak for a while, but it—it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that’s a great tribute to the fact that there’s a demand. Yeah.  Numerous provisions. We’ll give you a legal brief if you want.  Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess, you know, that could happen, but I don’t think that would happen. Go ahead please.  That’s because I let that happen because I would have preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen and I like the way they’ve done it. And the seven that remained really in sort of a semi-lockdown—if you look at those states, they’ve really done a very good job. They’re very much different from a New York or from other places where they’ve been hit very hard.  Go ahead, please. Yeah.  Well, they can decide, but —  No, not at all. Let me just tell you—very simple. I’m going to put it very simply: The President of the United States has the authority to do what the President has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The President of the United States calls the shots. If we weren’t here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you’ve never seen before. We were here to back them up. And we’re backing—and we’ve more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It’s a decision for the President of the United States. Now, with that being said, we’re going to work with the states because it’s very important. You have local governments, they’re pinpointed. It’s really—you talk about—it’s like a microchip. They are pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. And if they don’t do a good job, I’d step in so fast. But no, they can’t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.  Go ahead, please.  Well, if some states refuse to open, I would be—I would like to see that person run for election. They’re going to open. They’re going to all open.  I think that’s something that’s not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to — Now, some will be—are in a different situation. You have—I won’t name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I’m going to be very specific. But you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard. But all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible. But they want to open safely and so do I. Yeah, please.  No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard. And again, he has to do what he has to do. He’s a friend of mine. But France—Spain has just been decimated. You look at what’s happened in Italy, it’s a very well-known fact, what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard.  It’s a group. SECRETARY MNUCHIN:—today, for him to sign off on.  We’ve had very good dis-—really just good discussions.  Steve, I just want to say we have had — —discussions—wait, excuse me. One second, please. We’ve had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions.  I don’t want to say that. You’ll be hearing over the next few days.  And, Steve, do you want to talk about phase four? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, phase four, the President has talked about infrastructure for a long period of time. We’ve talked about—to the extent that the hospitals need more money because of the medical issues, we’ll monitor that. We want to make sure there are incentives for restaurants, entertainment—people to get back to those types of things. So we’ll be looking at, very specifically, provisions to stimulate parts of the economy. Some of them may be money issues. Some of them may be regulatory issues.  When you say “my authority”—the President’s authority. Not mine, because it’s not me.  This is—when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that’s the way it’s got to be.  It’s total. It’s total.  And the governors know that.  The governors know that. No, you have — —a couple of bands of—excuse me. Excuse me. You have a couple —  You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree to it.  But the authority of the President of the United States, having to do with the subject we’re talking about, is total. Yeah, please, go ahead.  Go ahead, please.  At the right time.  And a very good question, actually. Well, I’m going to have to take a look. I wouldn’t say Italy is doing great right now, and I wouldn’t say Spain is doing great right now. And we just heard that France is extending its stay-inside order, right? Their stay—they’ve extended it—I just see that—and, I think, for a short period of time. But no, when they’re back. We want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything is good. No, right now we have a very —  Right now we have a very strong ban. We’re going to keep it that way until they heal.  Well, I can’t tell you that. I can’t tell you that. I have to see: How are they doing? I mean, France just went for another two days—for another two weeks. We have to see. Jon.  Well, I’m not sure who—Jon, I’m not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took —  I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don’t know.  Okay.  I will and many other people also. But I will absolutely take their advice.  Please go ahead.  I don’t think it would be likely because I think we’re not very far from being on the same page. Please.  Well, they have to do it. Look, they’re supposed to be doing it.  Yeah, I know. I know.  Well, they—they may need help, but —  But they’re there. They’re on ground. They’ve got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it.  And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuilt tests. We—we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing. I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened, where they have such a great test as that? And, in fact, what I’ll do—I think, unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of the Treasury—do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody?  Is that for the Secretary of the Treasury or for me?  Because if it’s for me, we can wait.  We have to get him back to work, okay?  Well, we didn’t want to do the Kennedy Center, just so you understand. And that that was done—the Democrats wanted it in. We didn’t want that, but they wanted it in. And we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That’s what we’re looking for. We’re not looking for extraneous nonsense.  But are you talking about unemployment? You’re talking about the unemployment?  Sending it indirectly to the states?  We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And, you know, I’ve talked to you about it: We have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems. They’re run by the state. But I’m hearing they’re getting the money out anyway. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: So, some—some of them are, and some of the states aren’t, and we encourage—you know, we’re working with the states to try to update their computers, but it’s a—it’s a long haul.  Okay? Thank you, Steve. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  Phase four, Steve. Phase four. Come on, Steve.  Okay. So you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to write up papers on this. It’s not going to be necessary, because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately it comes with the federal government. That being said, we’re getting along very well with the governors, and I feel very certain that there won’t be a problem. Yeah, please. Go ahead.  I haven’t asked anybody because I don’t—you know why?  Because I don’t have to. Go ahead, please.  Enough. Please.  It’s nice of Governor Hogan, very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan’s statement.  Cuomo.  Which one? What did he say?  Well, they’re looking at things in phase four, where they have—you know, where they talk about states, and they’re also talking about hospitals. They’re talking about states who have been battered, and they’re also talking about hospitals. And we’re certainly willing to look at that.  You know, we’ll see what we all come back with. But they are talking about states and they’re talking about hospitals. OAN.  The sale of what?  Well, I don’t think that’s going to happen. I think it’s very extreme. But she’s doing it, and I think it’s going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It’s a very strong position to take. But they’re making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let’s see how it all works.  We’re going to be talking about that very soon. I’m getting a full report. I’m not happy with the World Health Organization. I’m not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We’ve been ripped off by everybody. And we have—this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it’s a World Health or World Trade. And they’re like—I call them the “Bobbsey Twins.” They’d look at our country—for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We’re doing a lot about it. So we’ll have a report. And we’ll also—we’re also talking about the World Trade Organization. But we’ve made a lot of progress there. We’re now winning cases for the first time, because they know I’ll leave if we don’t get treated fairly. This country—our country—was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization. But now we’re winning a lot of them, because they know I’m not—I’m not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice.  Uh, yeah. I would say, by the end of the week, I’m going to make a decision on that. Yeah. There’s a lot of—right now, there’s a lot of things happening.  How do you know there are no consequences?  How do you know there are no consequences?  I wouldn’t tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?  No, you started off by saying, “Why are there no consequences?”  How do you know there are no consequences?  You’re going to find out.  I wouldn’t tell you. You’d probably be the last person on Earth I’d tell.  Go ahead. Uh, yeah, please.  Well, make no mistake about it: In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. And you can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the President said, we’ll happily brief that. But in the days ahead, what the President has charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We’re going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to counsel the President. And then, working with the CDC, we’re going to produce new guidelines, based upon the data, for every state and territory in this nation. We’re going to give them guidance. And, as the President has indicated, we’ll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in America. But this is an unprecedented time. But I have to tell you: When you look at the fact—despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 Americans—when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps that President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America. I mean, we were discussing today, at the task force, that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today. And that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it’s also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists, now more than a month ago, and our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour. And I have to tell you that standing here today, I couldn’t be more proud to stand alongside this President and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour. And I just say to you: To every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you’re doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you’re saving lives and you’re seeing our nation through this time.  Go ahead.  Well, you don’t know that. You don’t know that. THE VICE PRESIDENT: But—but the President—the President will be —  You don’t know that. I’m sorry. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear your question.  You don’t know that. No, you made a statement. You don’t know that. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I didn’t hear your—I didn’t hear your statement. I’m sorry.  And we would—and we would like to have their cooperation. And we are going to have their cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch. THE VICE PRESIDENT: I—and let me just affirm what the President said. We heard it again today in what I think was our ninth conference call with governors is: I think every American would be proud to see the partnership that this President has forged with governors across the country. I mean, it is an extraordinary statement. And you’ll see some data when Admiral Polowczyk gets up in just a few moments, but the flow of resources from around the world that we’ve moved into areas that have faced challenges—I mean, this President has directed us to ensure that every state has what they need, when they need it. And the spirit that I heard again from Republicans and Democrat governors today was reflective of that partnership. And as we move forward to the President’s goal of reopening America, we expect the same kind of partnership in the interest of the nation.  All right, go ahead, with the face mask. Go ahead.  Barely.  I hear you well, actually.  Well, we’re looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we’ve done. THE VICE PRESIDENT: She was on today.  I mean, she’s actually—and she was on today, saying very good things. Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back.  It does. And I hope that won’t happen. I certainly hope that won’t happen, but it does weigh on my mind. Okay, in the back, go ahead. You had one. Go ahead.  Go ahead, please.  China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that—we’re not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I’ve been very explicit on that. But we know all about that. And, no, China is—we’ve seen what they did. We’ve seen many other things that they’ve done, both pro and con. And we’ll be just fine.  I don’t want to say that, but we’re going to be putting out guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly. In a few days.  I’m not going to say. But, look, certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They’re doing, really, very well. And so we’re going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon. Steve?  Well, you’re going to see. I—I don’t want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know, pretty much—we have some good ideas. I also do want to get—I want to have—we’ll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people, having to do with certain fields, whether it’s energy or whether it’s entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera. We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do. Whether it’s deductibility or not, we’ll see, but it should be deductibility. You’ll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductibility. The restaurant business, it—it was one of the hot businesses. And then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago. But we may need that to get people back into the restaurants. Please.  Absentee ballot, are you talking about? Absentee ballot?  Well, I don’t know what she did. I mean, I didn’t see that. When did that happen? Today?  Well, I wish her luck. I wish her a lot of luck. Please, go ahead.  We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but we—it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine. And they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20—maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10. And I think it was a very important call. I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia and that was a very important call. And the bottom nine is OPEC Plus. It’s called OPEC Plus because there are other states also, other nations. We came to a very good agreement. Please.  Go ahead.  I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders. And we’re talking about our borders a little bit—our borders with Mexico. Because, as you know, Mexico is a big part of the deal. And Mexico really—it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico. And the President—we appreciated a certain amount of flexibility. But we talked about borders, we talked about China, we talked about Mexico.  Well, I mean, I—we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point. Please.  Well, they have to get the material. You know, the governors have to get the material.  Now, if they can’t get it, they’re going to see us.  I’m talking about the local governments. I’m talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we—we’re going to go into—I’d ask Mike to go into it as soon as I leave. They have very powerful machines that they don’t know they even have. I’m not talking about Abbott; I’m talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this —  You know what I’m talk-—do you know what I’m referring to?  Very big, very powerful machines where, in a certain state’s case, they’re only using 10 percent of their capacity and they didn’t know it. That happens to be Illinois. Jon, please.  What do you think the answer to that is? THE VICE PRESIDENT: We’re rapidly—we’re rapidly increasing the numbers, Mr. President.  Rapidly increasing the numbers. THE VICE PRESIDENT: And Deb will speak to ( ).  Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly.  Well, you have other machines where they can really work.  And a lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn’t even know they had them. They didn’t even know that they had them. And Mike is going to be talking about that.  Yeah. Google and Apple.  You mean Google and Apple combination.  No. A lot of people don’t like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. I mean, a lot of people don’t like it and some people think it’s great. No, they are working on that, as I understand.  Yeah, no, I know that. I know that. I know.  That’s right. No, Google is looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple or looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we’re looking at now is going to be obsolete. That’s how good it is. We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can’t talk about yet, but it’s incredible. Plus, I think they’re doing—Tony—I think they’re doing very well in the vaccines. They’re working hard on the vaccines and I think you’ll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there’s some great things coming out with respect to that. Now you need a testing period, but you’re going to have some great things. Please.  No, no. This is—this is the Google and Apple. I don’t know if it’s a partnership or what, but they’re working on some —  They’re working on more than one element. They’re working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something, as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they’re doing that in a singular fashion.  Okay.  Yeah. Yeah.  I know.  That’s right.  Well, it’s an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It’s an amazing thing and it would be—actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar but not as good.  I hear Singapore is. Singapore is. No, Singapore had a little bit of a setback because they had a –they had a break. You know that, and—but they’ll take care of it. I know—I know the folks in Singapore. They’re doing a great job and they’re going to put it back very quickly. But Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things.  Well, I don’t want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That’s something we’re going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it. Yeah, please. Go ahead.  Well, it’s moving along. I think I can speak because I—I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well. It’s a test that’s been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it. But that’s moving on. The antibody test have—moving along very well. Okay, anymore COVID-19? COVID-19? Yeah, Steve.  Well, that’s going through the Navy, as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that. And they had a break in—I don’t think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic, to be honest with you. You know, I don’t think the captain should have been writing letters. He’s not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn’t have been writing letters. And I don’t think—I don’t know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam. But they stopped in Vietnam and all of a sudden they get on, and now you have over 500 sailors and—and people on the ship that are affected. I don’t know whose idea that was, but that wasn’t such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic. Yes, please. Jon. Go ahead, Jon.  Nothing changed it. No, no, I know exactly what you’re going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states or maybe will or maybe have, and the fact that we’ve gotten on—that’s one thing. The fact that I don’t want to use the power is another thing. Look —  Yes, Constitution.  Constitutionally. You can look at constitutionally. You can look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. Jon, the fact that I don’t want to exert my power is much different. We have the power. You asked, “Does the federal government have the power?” The federal government has absolute power. It has the power. As to whether or not I’ll use that power, we’ll see. I would rather —  Jon, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That’s why with—I guess it’s now seven states not eight that—because South Carolina did—you know, they went away from what we discussed the last time. So that’s why I looked at the individual states; they’re doing a very good job. They’re really doing a very good job. I’d rather have them make the decision. Now, the fact that I’d rather have—that’s fine. But I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship. Now, we’ll see what happens. If you notice, the few states you’re talking about, they’re all with Democrat governors. But if governors are doing a good job and they control it better—because you don’t have somebody in Washington saying, “Set up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.” And we’re in Washington and they’re in a state that’s very far away. That’s really—it should be and it should have always been. And I’ve always said it was. But the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good. And we’ll be announcing, over the next very short period of time, exactly what we’re going to be doing. Okay, a couple of more. Go ahead.  Well, nobody has called about coronavirus, about—from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, which is swine flu, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. And you take a look at what—you take a look at the history. And, you know, 17,000 people died. And you talk about late? They were so late—they were late like it never even existed. That was a—that was a big problem. Caused a lot of other people a big problem too. So, you know, if Joe Biden would like a briefing, I’d certainly get him a briefing. I don’t know what he’d do with it. Yeah, please.  No.  No, they’re not. No.  Yeah. Yes, go ahead, please.  Well, you have Mike’s task force, which is the White House Task Force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. And I was on many of those calls. And every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished—I mean, today’s call was a very good call, a very friendly call. I think everyone is online. And again, you don’t have anybody driving you crazy, saying they’re not getting ventilators, they’re not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now.  And we always err—and I think it’s important for you know—we always erred on the sake of “Give them more.” Even when we didn’t think—we didn’t think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn’t think they needed the ventilators that they asked for. And we were right. Now, on ventilators, we’re ready to march. I told you this: We’re ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We’re ready to move them anywhere in the country when we need them, if we need them. We’re also building a lot of ventilators, and that’s going to be used at some point, I believe. You know we’re going to have stockpiles, including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us. But we’re also going to help other countries, whether it’s Italy, or Spain, or other—France is having a big problem. They all desperately need—Germany too—they need ventilators. So we’re going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot—you heard the numbers—we have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming. Okay, final question. Steve.  No. Then we have—in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We’ll have a transportation committee. We’re going to have a manufacturing committee. You’ll see it tomorrow. We’re also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We’re having committees with religious leaders. You’ve been seeing what’s going on with the churches, and all of that. And we’re going to have a faith leaders committee. And so we have—we’re going to have a few committees. I’ll call them “committees,” and then ultimately we’re going to make decisions. So we’re going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they’re going to be the correct decision. I hope so. Steve.  Soon. Soon. And they already know what I want.  And so, when we form—when you say “form,” I don’t have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields. So I don’t have to say, “Gee, let’s—we just met and we’re going to meet in two weeks and here’s what we’re…” I said, “Here’s what I want.” We’ve already told them. And they’re the — —the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. I mean, they’re—these are the greatest names. The people that, I think, probably know the best. So, we’ve called them and we’re going to be speaking to them very soon. And we want them to have—if it’s questions, or statements, we want them to have that for us. And we will have either a response, or maybe—I mean, ideally we’re going to be learning from them. And we’ll be able to do that and put them—put everything we learned from those calls into our new guidelines. So we’re going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it’s going to be very good. I think it’s going to be very smooth. And I hope it’s going to be very safe. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He’s a great real estate person—passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great. Great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate. He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he tested positive. Stanley is in his early- to mid-80s, I guess. And Stanley went to the hospital and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time and he never made it. A great man. He left—very charitable, really a great philanthropist. A very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. So I got to know him a lot. He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like—like a young boy. And he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought we’d do such a good job and he was so happy. And he—he was very proud of what we’ve done in this administration. But he was tested positive, and unfortunately he—he didn’t make it. It’s a very—to me, it’s a very sad thing. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
"Okay. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you. A big day today at the White House. All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working—and very strongly working, I might add. New cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area. Cases in the Detroit and Denver metro areas are flat. Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining. The battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. Hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress. These encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we’ll be announcing. We’re going to be talking about that tomorrow. We’ll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon. We’re going to be announcing guidelines, and we’ll be talking about various states. And it’s very exciting. It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest. There’s never been an economy like what we had produced, but we’ll produce it again. And I think we’ll produce it again very fast. The medical and healthcare advances we’ve made are critical to our continued progress. We’ve rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests. To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further. Today, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity. It’s a great test. The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks. My administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Air Bridge, which has been an amazing success. We have completed 44 flights—and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes—44 flights of critical supplies as of today and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future. We have some very brilliant people working on this. It’s logistically incredible what they’ve done. And we’ve also been working on this with the military. And these people have been—the genius of all of them together, it has been incredible to watch. In total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39.4 million N95 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks, and 10.2 million gowns. We ordered 500 million masks, and they’ll be coming shortly. And we’ve distributed 100 million masks. Following our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana—a great place. They did it in 11 days, from start to finish, a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker. GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come. And we have other companies doing something similar. And I think they said that there’s a brief clip that we have of General Motors, sent to us by General Motors. And I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit. Please. ( ) I know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play. It’s amazing. It’s—you know, what they’ve done in a very, very short period of time. They’re now making thousands of ventilators, and they’re coming out of the factory very rapidly, at a clip that nobody can even believe. But we have others also doing it. And these are very high-grade ventilators. So we’re helping a lot of people. And at this moment, nobody needs them. We have to remember, during the surge, nobody has needed him for weeks now. But we’ll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we’re going to have them for other countries because nobody is able to do things like we can do. And we’re going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly. My administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies—so important, therapies—treatments, and ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine. But frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people right now. The vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time. But we have some great potential therapies already, and we’ll see how they’re working. We’ll be able to report on that, I think, over the next week or two. Tremendous progress has been made. At least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway. So 35 different genius companies. If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they’ve come up with the answers to so many things, you wouldn’t have believed it. And we’re very honored to be working with them. They include antivirals, and also—and they—something which is incredible: It keeps the virus from multiplying. A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying. Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus. And convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients. And we have a lot of patients who recover, and they’re so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say, “We want to give our blood.” And they do that. It’s incredible. We have thousands of people that are doing that. They recover and they feel they have an obligation because they’ve gotten such great care. And a lot of them didn’t think they were going to make it. As the entire U.S. government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed. And we’re not allowing that to take place through our Congress. They’re just not—they’re just not giving it to us. We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can’t get the approvals. The Democrats are holding us up. We cannot get approval. We’ve gotten judges because we go through the process. I guess we’re up to 448 federal judges. And that, we’ve gotten because we focus on it; we take the maximum time. Because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours to approve, and it leaves no time left for others. Very unfair system. If a judge is going to be approved in one hour, in one session, it doesn’t matter—they’ll take the maximum number of hours and days—you’re talking about days—to get one judge approved. And we’re close to 250 judges, but because of the way they’re doing it, there’s no time for anybody else. And many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years. We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that. There are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction. Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges. And I’ve read, over the last couple of years, “Well, I didn’t fill positions.” I don’t fill positions—in some cases, we don’t need the position, and I’m all for that. But in many cases, you do, but we can’t get them approved by the Democrats. They won’t release them. The positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United States, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs. And Sonny Perdue, who’s going to be speaking today, is saying, “Please, can I have this man, can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?” He’s been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won’t allow it to happen. Again, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through maximum, or at least they go through a long process. So it takes days and days, and there’s no time left. And it’s just a concerted effort to make life difficult. An example is Michael Pack. He’s my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasking —Broadcasting Board of Governors. And he’s been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America. Very important. And if you heard what’s coming out of the Voice of America, it’s disgusting. What—things they say are disgusting toward our country. And Michael Pack would get in and he’d do a great job, but he’s been waiting now for two years. Can’t get him approved. The senators left Washington until at least May 4th. The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances—the “recess appointment,” it’s called—the Senate’s practice of dabbling into so-called pro forma sessions where no one is even there. It has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we’re giving—that we’re given under the recess provisions. The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments. We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government—and now more so than ever before, because of the virus and the problem. We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do. They’ve made it very, very difficult to run government. I don’t think any administration has done anywhere near what we’ve done in three and a half years. But every block—every week, they put up roadblocks, whether it’s “Russia, Russia, Russia,” or whether it’s impeachment hoax, or whatever it may be. It’s always roadblocks and a waste of time. If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress. The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis. It is a scam, what they do. It’s a scam, and everybody knows it. And it’s been that way for a long time. And perhaps it’s never done before—it’s never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has. But we’re going to do it. We need these people here. We need people for this crisis, and we don’t want to play any more political games. I’ve been waiting for two and a half years, three years, for some of these people. And they’re great people. They left law firms. They left jobs. They gave up everything to do it. And they’ve been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved. It’s ridiculous. And everyone knows they’re going to be approved. But there’s only so many hours in the day, when you go through judges and you go through a lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately. And they could do it in one session, one—and they could do it in one hour. And instead, it takes them many days. In order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the U.S. government has put a hold on funding to the WHO—World Health Organization—pending a review of the organization’s cover-up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak. Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China. They didn’t want to do it. They were angry that we did it. It was early on. They were angry that we did it. Took them a long time to realize what was going on, but I have a feeling they know exactly what was going on. Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn’t do any form of ban. And you see what happened to Italy. You see what happened to Spain. You see what happened to France. WHO’s guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world. That was a horrible, tragic mistake—or perhaps they knew. I’m sure they didn’t know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew. Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense. To ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we’ve now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. This action has saved millions of American jobs. It’s been an incredible success. And they want to replenish it now, but, again, the Democrats don’t want to do that. This is money that goes to the workers of our country. Phase one was $350 billion dollars. And now phase two, we want to do $250 billion. This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation. Mike McFarland from Nebraska recently said this historic relief has been a godsend for his small factory, and the 136 Americans who work there. He saved those jobs. Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto-repair shop’s four employees. Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately. The Republicans want to do it; they want to do it immediately. They want to do it now. And the Democrats are stopping it. A short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries. In a few moments, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation’s dedicated workers in the food processing profession—because it’s a profession. It’s incredible what they do: food processing. And they’re keeping our grocery stores full. The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile—the medical stockpile, where the shelves were bare. “The cupboard was bare,” I say. Tomorrow, I’ll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed. And we really think, with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we’re going to have an economy that really comes back quickly. And we’d like to see it more than match what we had before. What we had before was a miracle. And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle. We’re going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world. We’ll also be speaking to America’s governors tomorrow and then we’ll be announcing exactly what’s happening. You already know we’ll be opening up states—some states much sooner than others. And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st. And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed. Governors are looking forward—they’re chomping at the bit to get going. Again, not all states are the same. They’re very different. Some are having very little problems. Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they’re ready to go. So, Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow. We’ll be discussing procedures. Today, I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation’s most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy. My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing, and sports industries. We want to get our country open again. We want to have our sports leagues open. You want to watch sports. It’s important. We miss sports. We miss everything. We want to get back. These experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy. They gave us a lot of great ideas. We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people—the highest of the high-tech. The level of I Thank you very much. Thank you, Doctor. Sonny, please. SECRETARY PERDUE: Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to be here with you today and to—I want you to know it’s an honor to represent you in leading the Department of Agriculture and represent the constituency who are crucial in maintaining our nation’s food security, enabling us to keep food on the table of our American families—not only just food, but wholesome and safe food as well. I’d like to start my remarks today by echoing what my colleagues at the CDC have been saying regarding the health and safety of our essential employees across the United States. CDC has provided strategies there that aimed at helping our most critical workers, both in healthcare and food processing, to quickly and safely return to work after potential exposure to COVID-19, provided those workers are symptom-free. And this guidance will help these critical industries in the food sector provide—to protect the health and safety of essential workers, while keeping critical functions working throughout the COVID-19 response. As we know, any employee who develops symptoms while on the job should go home immediately. And the interim guidance is in line with CDC recommendations for healthcare workers, caring for those sick with COVID-19. So we appreciate the dedication and commitment of all the brave men and working—women working to keep their communities fed. And we will continue to work with the CDC to keep those individuals as safe as possible during these challenging times. In that vein, there’s been a lot happening this week, as COVID-19 is impacting food-processing facilities, as you know. For Americans who be—may be worried about access to good food because of this, I want to assure you: The American food supply is strong, resilient, and safe. And in fact, our food supply chain has shown tremendous agility in shifting production and logistics so suddenly from restaurant and institutional settings to retail settings. To all the employers out there in this sector: It’s critical that you follow CDC guidelines and guidance and best practices to keep all of your employees and people safe and healthy. To employees and local public health officials advising them: The CDC has issued guidelines on how to mitigate a situation if you have a positive case in one of your facilities. We need our local health authorities and our state health authorities to do everything they can to balance the demand of keeping our facilities operational and our critical industries going, while at the same time keeping the health and safety of employees as a top priority, as well as our communities. So I want to also take this time to thank all of our critical, essential food supply chain workers. The entire country is counting on these patriotic individuals, by doing the work in our food supply chain. These dedicated workers include, obviously, farmers and producers, but also processers, truckers, and grocery store workers, as you know. America is depending on what you have—the food we need to feed our families—and you’re the ones who are making that happen. Thank you. As an entire nation, we’re truly thankful for the work you’re doing, and we recognize that you are the true patriotic heroes during this national emergency, along with our healthcare workers. So, before I sign off here, Mr. President, I want to remind you and all of us of one more thing: In the United States, we have plenty of food for all of our citizens. I want to be clear: The bare store shelves that you may see in some cities in the country are a demand issue, not a supply issue. The way food is prepared and packaged to be sold in a restaurant or a school is significantly different than the way it’s packaged for you to buy in the grocery store. Our supply chain is sophisticated, efficient, integrated, and synchronized, and it’s taken us a few days to relocate the misalignment between institutional settings and grocery settings. But that does not mean that we don’t have enough food in this country to feed the American people. You might think of it as an interstate when it’s flowing in along well, and you have a crash in one place—it backs up. And that’s what’s happening in the food supply chain. But we’re working through that. And all this—through all this, our food supply chain has proven to be very resilient, just like American people. To the extent we have challenges, we have and continue to—to work through it all together. And we can and we will get through this with a whole-of-America approach, Mr. President—the critical partnership between state and local health officials, management of companies, and the employees. And we will meet any challenges we face by working together. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity.  Thank you very much. And before the Vice President comes up, I just wanted to say, speaking of Sonny, China has paid us billions of dollars—many, many billions of dollars—in tariffs, which we’ve distributed—some to the farmers, because they were targeted. We have many billions of dollars being held by Sonny. And I’ve told him to distribute much of that money to the farmers. Our farmers were targeted and now they’re benefiting by the amount that they were targeted. And we are very honored to do that. And, Sonny, you’re going to start that process very soon. You’ll let the farmers know. Nobody can take advantage of our farmers. So we have a lot of money that we’ve taken in from China. We’re going to be distributing that money from—from Sonny to the farmers. And there is tremendous money over and above that. That money was paid directly into the Treasury of the United States. This has never happened to China before. They never gave us 10 cents. Now they’re paying us billions of dollars and we appreciate it. So thank you very much, Sonny. Great job. Please. Mike, please. THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. It was reported to us that we’ve conducted and completed 3,324,000 tests across the nation. More than 619,000 Americans have tested positive. But as you reflected yesterday when we welcomed coronavirus survivors here to the White House from across the country, some more than 45,000 Americans have fully recovered. Sadly, we mourn the loss of more than 27,000 of our—our countrymen. Our hearts are with their families and with the families of all of those that continue to struggle with the serious consequences of this illness. But as Dr. Birx just reflected, despite the heartbreaking losses, we’re getting there, America. Because of the efforts of people all across this country to put into practice the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines, because of their adherence to the direction of state and local authorities, as Dr. Birx just reflected, we—we see great signs of progress from the West Coast to the East Coast. President Trump has directed our team to develop new guidelines that will be presented tomorrow to our nation’s governors and—and released to the American people thereafter. The American people will be encouraged to know that, as we stand here today, 24 percent of the counties of this country have no reported coronavirus cases. In fact, half of the states in America have less than 2,500 cases per state. This is a great tribute to the efforts by the people of those communities. But as the President suggested, when we unveil the guidelines that the team has been working to present tomorrow to our nation’s governors, we’re going to reflect on the fact that, as the President said, there will be areas of the country that will require continued mitigation and strong efforts. And there will be other areas of the country that will be—be given guidance for greater flexibility, and the President has so directed our team. When we think of more than 619,000 Americans having tested positive, more than 45,000 having recovered, we wanted to announce today that the FDA recently announced efforts to facilitate the development and access to convalescent plasma, Mr. President. You’ve spoken about this. People who have recovered from the coronavirus have antibodies in your bloodstream that can attack the virus. The Mayo Clinic today is working with the Red Cross to make sure that coronavirus patients have access to the convalescent plasma treatments, and over 1,000 institutions across America have already joined this program. And we want to urge every American who has recovered from the coronavirus for at least two—and preferably four weeks, to contact your local blood or plasma donation center and arrange to donate. It’s one more way that the American people can do their part and step forward. And thousands have already done so, and we know that tens of thousands will join them. On the subject of supplies—Mr. President, I’ll be very brief because you detailed a great amount. As the President mentioned, the air bridge has completed 44 flights. Fifty-six more are scheduled. But on the subject of facial masks, which are so important for the protection of critical infrastructure, I’m pleased to report that the average daily delivery through the commercial network through our air bridge is 22 million facial masks coming into the marketplace. The average inventory in the network over a seven-day period is 80 million masks. And FEMA is actually working, as we speak, to move facial masks to priority infrastructure: food supply, first responders. There’ll be 6.5 million masks that go out before the end of this week, an additional 20 million before April the 20th, and then we’ll be adding 6.5 million each and every week. At that the President’s direction, we’re going to ensure that all of those that work in food supply, all of those first responders have access to masks. And we’re increasing those every day. Finally, I know I speak for the President when I say how proud we are of all of our healthcare workers across the country, and how proud we are of the men and women in uniform—our medical professionals who have been deployed across the nation, literally by the thousands. In fact, as we stand here today, 576 doctors, nurses, and other military medical professionals have been deployed to 13 hospitals across the nation: 10 in New York, and 1 in Connecticut, Texas, and Louisiana each. And, as the President reflected a few days ago, because we did not have the—happily, did not have the demand on the Javits Center and on the Comfort in New York City, at the President’s direction, we have deployed doctors and nurses from those two facilities to hospitals. In fact, the President and I were just speaking to Mayor de Blasio just before we came out, and he expressed his great admiration and appreciation for the relief that these medical military personnel have provided to incredibly dedicated people in our hospitals. Two hundred and fifty-eight medical personnel just yesterday were deployed off the ship and out of the Javits Center into New York. With that, Mr. President, I’ll step aside. But it’s remarkable to think of all that we’ve accomplished over the last month since you first issued the Presidential Guidelines for America. The truth is, because of what the American people have done over the last 30 days, we are slowing the spread. We are ensuring that every American family would have access to the healthcare that we’d want any member of our family to have—with the greatest healthcare professionals in the world. We’re saving lives and we’re healing our land. And so we want to thank the American people for all you have done. And tomorrow, we’ll be presenting a new guidance to the governors of this country about how we build on our progress and reopen America in a safe and responsible way. Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mike. Great. Thank you, Mike.  Steve, please.  Very simple: If they don’t act on getting these people approved that we need because of the—we need them anyway, but we especially need now because of the pandemic—we are going to do something that will be something I’d prefer not doing, but which I should do and I will do if I have to. Kaitlan, go ahead.  Sure.  It’s what I want too. And we have great tests. And we want the states to administer these tests, for the most part. But we’re standing behind them. We have great tests. We’ve done more testing now than any country, as you know, in the world, by far. We have the best tests of any country in the world. Nobody have—has the quality of tests, the—if you look at Abbott, what they’ve come up with in a short period of time. They’ve been incredible. Roche has been incredible. We have the best tests in the world. And we will be working very much with the governors of the states. We want them to do it. We’re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas. We’re not going to be running a parking lot, where you have a Walmart—which has been great, by the way; Walmart has done a fantastic job—but where you have a testing center and running that from Washington, D.C. The states are much better equipped to do it. But we’ll be working with the states. We’re standing behind the states. We’re going to work very closely with the governors, in terms of that—getting additional equipment. It used to be three, four weeks ago—two weeks ago, “Can we get more ventilators?” More ventilators, right? And we got them ventilators, and you don’t hear that anymore. It’s been pretty amazing, what we’ve been able to do. Yeah. Go ahead, Jon.  Well, I think the companies will determine that, and the governors will determine that, and the federal government will de-—and if we’re not happy, we’ll take very strong action against a state or a governor. If we’re not happy with the job a governor is doing, we’ll let them know about it. And, as you know, we have very strong action we can take, including a closedown, but we don’t want to do that. We’re working with the governors and we’re working closely with the governors. The relationship has been very good. The Vice President has had a lot of conversations over the last two weeks with either 50 or almost 50 governors on every conversation. And they’ve been really positive conversations.  Well, we have the right to do whatever we want. But we wouldn’t do that. But, no, we would have the right to close down what they’re doing if we want to do that. But we don’t want to do that —  —and I don’t think there’ll be any reason to do that, but we have the right to do that. Steve? Go ahead. Go ahead.  Well, I don’t know too much about it, but I understand my name is there. I don’t know where they’re going, how they’re going. I do understand it’s not delaying anything. And I’m satisfied with that. I don’t—I don’t imagine it’s a big deal. I’m sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check and my name is on it. Yeah. Go ahead, please.  Go ahead, please. Please.  Please. Please. Go ahead.  Well, the governors can control that flow, as an example. In fact, I just saw, a little while ago, it was reported that certain borders are being controlled already by states. They’re starting to take control of their borders, which is good. So they’ll be controlling. They may do testing for people wanting to come in; I’d read that about Rhode Island. So they have to watch it. They have to be very careful. Yeah, please. In the back.  So our relationship with Canada is very good. We’ll talk about that. It will be one of the early borders to be released. Canada is doing well. We’re doing well. We’ll see. But at some point, we’ll be doing that. In the meantime, nations that are heavily infected—we have a lot of nations that are heavily infected. Some are getting better. Some are still on the way up, unfortunately. We’re keeping very strong borders with those nations. But with Canada, we are talking about different things. Yeah, please.  Well, all we’re doing is looking at the numbers, we’re looking at our graphs, we’re looking at our models. We’re getting a great response from Deborah and from Tony and from many of the professionals that are working. We have great professionals working with us. And, I think, based on that, we’re—we’re doing very well. Based on that, it looks like we’re headed absolutely in the right direction. But some states are looking at other states, and they’re saying, “I can’t imagine what they’re going through”—because they’re not in that position. They’re in very good shape. I would say that we have 20 states, at least, but you really have 29 that are in extremely good shape. You have others that are getting much better. And I think, with almost a few exceptions, you have every state that is either doing better or on the way to doing better. Yeah, please.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Well, it is—it’s—look, it’s been a very partisan government for a long period of time, not just this administration. You can go back into the last two administrations; you’ve seen a lot of partisanship. And even now, you would think that we wouldn’t have. As an example, with the Paycheck Plan, that’s going so well. It’s so smooth, so beautiful, almost without a hitch. All of that money is being distributed to small businesses. They’re giving it to their employees. It’s keeping them ready, viable. So when we open—and now, it’s been so good that it’s almost depleted and we want to replenish it, and we can’t get the Democrats to approve it. And that’s a program that they and everybody else admit that are great. So, you do have partisanship. We have been trying for years to get people approved for positions. People have left—one man left a law firm. One man left a—a big chain. He was a very successful executive; he left. It was two years ago. We have people that have been waiting for three years. And we can’t get them approved by the Democrats in the Senate because they’re taking so long to approve our judges. Now, I have to tell you that I’m totally in favor of what Mitch is doing with judges, because that’s—always seems to be a priority and it’s a very important priority. I think it’s one of the great trademarks of this administration: We’ve approved record numbers of federal judges and appellate judges and two Supreme Court judges. But rather than approving somebody who’s highly qualified—somebody that everybody knows is going to be approved—rather than going quickly, they take the maximum amount of time, whatever that time may be. And what they’re doing by doing that is taking days to approve somebody that could be approved in a quick vote. People that get phenomenal reviews in committee are going maximum number of hours. And what they do is—there’s only so many hours in a day. Now, we could have said, “Let’s stay.” I would have been in favor of that. They didn’t choose to do it. But I have a very strong power. I’d rather not use that power, but we have way over 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago. And one of them is the head of Voice of America. If you look at what they’re doing and what they’re saying about our country, it’s a disgrace—the people that are running that. We have somebody that’s really good, really talented, and that loves our country. And I want to get these people approved. That’s one of many. We have professionals. Sonny, you’ve been waiting for—how long have you been waiting for the man that we’re talking about coming in? SECRETARY PERDUE: Two and a half years.  Two and a half years. So Sonny Perdue just happens to be here talking about something else. So you’ve been waiting for one of the most important position, as Secretary of Agriculture, is the position—it’s distribution. We need it now. We’re talking about shelves. We’re talking about cupboards. He needs it. He’s been waiting—he didn’t know he was going to get this question. You’ve been waiting two and a half years. The person is exceptional. That person left a very good job. And it’s embarrassing to me. He’ll say, “Do you think you’ll get that man approved?” He’s been saying that to me for a long time. It’s because of the Democrats. And what we’re doing is—and I think anybody here would do it—judges are a priority. A federal judge is going to sit for 50 years, potentially—a young judge. Going to be sitting for—that’s always going to have to be a priority. But because they’re taking so much time and approving every—they’re trying to put us through the mill. That’s—when you talk about partisanship—and it’s never ever happened before. You can look at every administration in the history of this country. Nobody—nobody has ever had hundreds of people not approved after three and a half years. Go ahead, please.  Well, we’ll know soon. Look, they know. I—they’ve been warned and they’re being warned right now. If they don’t approve it, then we’re going to go this route. And we’ll probably be challenged in court, and we’ll see who wins. But when the court hears that we aren’t getting people approved—as Sonny would say, for two and a half years—for an important position that we need because of this crisis—we needed these people before, but now we really need these people.  Well, we are. There has to be a balance. You know, there’s also death involved in keeping it closed. And I’ve gone over this with you, and I believe this so strongly. When you look at mental health, when you look at suicides; suicide hotlines, which are exploding; people losing their jobs. When you look at drugs, and people that didn’t take drugs and now they’re becoming drug addicted because they’re going through a problem. They have no job. They have no money coming in—other than the money we’re getting them. We’ve opened up the coffers to a large extent. We’re helping people. This is why I wish the Democrats would help us a little bit with it, because they should. It’s purely partisan what they’re doing, and it’s bad for our country. But—but, you know, there is death by doing—by having this strongly closed country. We have to get back to work. With all of that being said, we’re going to start with states and with governors that have done a great job. And they’re going to open it up as they see fit. And we’re going to be right behind them. And we’re—we’re going to be working. We’re going to be supplying them with things if they don’t have them. We want them to have them. We’re going to be helping them with ventilators after this is over so that they can’t say, “Oh, the federal government…” We want them to have—they’ve had a lot of options. Many of the governors have had a lot of options, over the years, to buy ventilators. They didn’t choose to do it. So we’re going to be helping them to fill up their stockpiles. We’re going to have plenty. And as I said, I’m very proud to do it. We’re going to be helping other nations. We’re going to be helping Italy, Spain, France, other nations. And we’re going to be helping them strongly. I think Russia is going to need ventilators. They’re having a hard time in Moscow. We’re going to help them. We’re going to help other countries that need ventilators. We’re going to have a lot. You see it with General Motors. You see it with other companies that are producing. We’re going to have hundreds of thousands of ventilators. And it’s a great thing to have. Yes, in the back. Please. Is anybody freezing?  You know, it’s very cold out here. So we can leave early, right?  Okay, a couple more. Go ahead. Please.  Well, you don’t know what you have. Do you think you’re getting honest numbers from some of these countries? Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China—and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths—does anybody really believe that? Here’s the story: We report everything. We’re reporting the cases, and our reporting is good. We’re reporting every death. In fact, I see, this morning, where New York added 3,000 deaths because they died. And they’re now saying—rather than, “It was a heart attack”—they’re saying, “It was a heart attack caused by this.” So they’re adding. If you look at it, that’s it. And everything we have is documented, reported. And what they are doing is, just in case, they’re calling it this. And that’s okay. That’s okay. But we are—we have more cases because we do more reporting. We have more cases because everything is down. But does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries that you’ve been watching and you’ve been reporting on? And then, it’s like they didn’t have the big thing. They have been some really, really bad—heavily—and really, some countries that are in big, big trouble. And they’re not reporting the facts. And that’s up to them. All I know is: We report the facts, and we’re a country that’s getting better. John, go ahead.  Well, I don’t want to say that, John. But I will tell you, more and more, we’re hearing the story. And we’ll see. When you say “multiple sources”—now there’s a case where you can use the word “sources”—but we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened. Go ahead, please.  I don’t want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory. I just don’t want to discuss it. It’s inappropriate right now. Please, go ahead, in the back.  Look, I feel very badly about the World Health Organization, but it’s been a tool of China. It’s been, as I say, totally China-centric. You take a look at everything that’s happened; they’ve been wrong. I was all for it at the beginning. What do I know? I walked in, I said, “World Health Organization—isn’t that wonderful?” And then you start to see all the mistakes. They didn’t want us to close our borders to China—to Wuhan, specifically. They didn’t want our borders closed. You take a look—Mike was there; we were all there—and they’re criticizing me for closing the border. I did that very early. By the way, I did that very early, while Nancy Pelosi was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown. Because they—she thought it would be great. She wanted to show that this thing doesn’t exist. These are people—I’ll tell you, we have some politicians on the other side that don’t know what they’re doing. If you look at—if you look at timelines—you’ve got to look at some timelines. But the World—the World Health Organization, just like the World Trade Organization—I’m telling you—I call them—they have been treating the United States, for decades, so badly. And they’ve been so in favor of China. China took off when it joined the World Trade Organization because of what’s happened. Think of it: They’re considered a developing nation. And because they’re a dev-—and we’re not. But we’re a developing nation too, in my book. Okay? We’re developing too. But the fact is: We have been treated so badly by these organizations. And, believe me, I’m looking at that one too. We’re winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past. We’re winning a lot of money that we never won in the past. That’s with the World Trade. But with the World Health Organization—what’s happened there is a disgrace. Here’s the other thing: We pay $400- to $500 million a year. China is paying $38-, $39-, and $40 million a year. And it’s like they control this group. I could do that too, if I want to devote full time to it. I have some very capable people dealing with Dr. Tedros. Okay? I could do it too. I could do very well with that. But there’s something going on. There’s something going on that is very bad. Now, the $500 million that we save, we’ll determine—we’re going to make a determination over a little period of time. But they’re going to either have to make massive changes—I don’t even know if they’re going to be able to do that—or we’re going to give money to people. We want to help people. You know, what we do in Africa with AIDS—people have no idea what we do and the money we spent. We were talking about it the other day, Doctor. We are spending billions of dollars to help people. In the case of one that Dr. Birx is very much involved in, AIDS—billions of dollars. And you know what? It’s a great thing. Nobody talks about it. Nobody gives us credit. We do that, and we do it very directly. But we’re spending billions of dollars to help people live and—all over the world. But we’re spending $500 million to the World Health Organization, and there’s something very bad going on. And you know what? I’ve gotten very much involved. It’s been going on for a long period of time, and we don’t want to be the suckers anymore. So, it’s cold out. We will talk to you tomorrow. A big day tomorrow. Very big day. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I’m grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses. At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll. You see states are starting to open up now, and it’s very exciting to see. I think it’s very awe-inspiring. We’re coming out of it, and we’re coming out of it well. And we’re—really, I’m very happy the governors have been—the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it’s—it’s, really, pretty impressive to see. I’ve spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we’re leading the way. We’re really leading the way in so many different ways. I’m also very pleased that Harvard—as you know, it’s Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us. And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at. And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it’s about $350 million, and they’ve either not gone out or we’ve renegotiated it and they’re not getting them. So—and it’s—in a couple of cases, they’re sending them back and sending them back immediately. So I think it was very nice. I want to thank Harvard in particular. They acted very quickly and decisively. And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it. So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions. The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses. As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we’re making great progress. In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak—week. Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms. That’s a big number. To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance. And we all understand that very well; we’ve gone over it many, many times. This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering. A safe and phased reopening of our economy—it’s very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way. On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back. We’re winning this, and we’re going to win it, and we’re going to keep watching. We’re going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy. With each passing day, we’re learning more and more about this enemy. The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces. The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments. I have to say that, very excitingly, we’re going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while. It was a great report you gave. And he’s going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight. Wait until you hear the numbers. You won’t even believe them. U.S. trials of the COVID-19 have been going on and have been approved in the United States, Germany, UK, and China. That’s big news. And we’re—a lot of trials are going on. We have a lot of great, brilliant minds working on this, both from the standpoint of a vaccine and therapeutics. We must be careful in all conditions, but we will—we will get this done. We’re very close to a vaccine. Unfortunately, we’re not very close to testing because when the testing starts, it takes a period of time. But we’ll get it done. And I want to thank the head of DHS Science and Technology, Bill Bryan, for what he’s going to be doing and what he’s going to be saying and the report that he’s about to give. I think it’s going to be something that nobody has ever heard. It’ll be brand-new information and very important information. My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies. We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days. And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process. Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask. So that’s like ordering 20 times more masks. And it’s working very well. We just want the hospitals and the institutions, where it is, to use it. A lot of people don’t use it. They’re so used to getting a new mask, they don’t want to use it. They want to go and immediately get a new one. We’re asking them to use the sterilization process. Every bit as good—up to 20 times. Think of that. In addition to ramping up our domestic assembly lines, we also have airlifted nearly 750 million pieces of personal protective equipment into the United States through our Project Airbridge, which has been an incredible thing to watch. It’s really a military operation. The Vice President is now providing each governor with an exhaustive count[y]-by-county breakdown of the privately distributed personal protection. And this is equipment and things that are incredible. It’s personal protective equipment. It’s incredible, and it’s all brand new and at the highest level. We’re getting only the highest level. And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak. This way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge. We’re trying to get it immediately from the plane to the state. When we can’t do that, we bring it into our facilities and get it to the governors. And we’re getting them fast, and we’re notifying them very strongly so they know it’s there. Governors can use this information to quickly ensure that they get materials where and when they are needed. Today, I also want to extend my special thanks to our nation’s incredible county emergency management teams who have been working relentlessly for weeks around the clock, end on end, to serve their communities, help distribute critical supplies, and save countless American lives. We salute these heroic officials on the frontlines. As we continue to develop potential therapies, the FDA has recently begun a national effort to expand access to convalescent plasma donated from the blood of those who have recovered from the virus. The blood of these donors contains antibodies that can potentially reduce the severity of the illness in those who are sick—and frankly, those that are very sick. Nearly 3,000 patients are now enrolled in the Expanded Access Program, receiving transfusions nationwide. And I want to thank all of the people that recovered, for what they’ve done. They—as I said yesterday, they raise their hand when they barely can walk, and they’re saying, “I want to donate blood. I want to donate whatever it is that you want, because we want to help people.” It’s really quite incredible. Convalescent plasma will also be used to manufacture a concentrated antibody treatment that does not have to be matched with a particular blood type. This concentrated antibody treatment could be used as a preventative measure to keep healthcare workers and other high-risk populations from contracting the virus in the first place. A very big deal. Clinical trials of these products are slated to begin within weeks, and we can maybe have a fairly quick solution. I urge Americans to get in there and keep doing what you’re doing, because again, we want those people recovering or recovered from coronavirus to contact their local blood and plasma donation center to learn how they can help. And they’ve been so great, and I just appreciate it. My administration has also partnered with leading—and we have really been establishing some great partnerships with leading technology companies and scientific journals to create a database of 52,000 scholarly articles on the virus that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. Top AI experts are now using this wealth of data to gain insights into potential therapies. And we’re collaborating with tech firms, universities, and our national labs to harness American supercomputers in the search for treatments and vaccines. That search is going on, and it’s being—I think you’ll see in the future—you’ll see it’s very successful. Ultimately, it’ll be a tremendous success. Great progress is being made at a rapid pace—a pace like no other. We have every hope that with the full might and resources of American science and technology, and with the courage and devotion of the American people who have been so incredible, we will end this plague, and together we will restore the full measure of American strength and power and prosperity. Our country is going to do fantastically well. You see what’s going on. There is a pent-up demand in our country to get it back right where it was and maybe even better, and that’s what’s going to happen. So with that, I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up—Vice President. Say a few words please, Mike."
"Thank you very much. My fellow Americans: My first and highest duty as President is to defend our great country and the American people. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation, and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that, for George and his family, justice will be served.  He will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities, and as their President, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you.  I am your President of law and order, and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa, and others. A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residence. Innocent people have been savagely beaten, like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street, or the woman in Upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small-business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York’s Finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses, who have battled the virus, are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct station has been overrun.  Here in the nation’s capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War Two Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest. These are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God. America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy; healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos. This is our mission, and we will succeed. One hundred percent, we will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available federal resources--civilian and military--to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately: First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today, I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital, Washington, D.C. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property. We are putting everybody on warning: Our seven o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent life and property will be arrested, detained, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is: one law. We have one beautiful law. And once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business, and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the foundation of our prosperity, our freedom, and our very way of life.  But where there is no law, there is no opportunity. Where there is no justice, there is no liberty. Where there is no safety, there is no future. We must never give in to anger or hatred. If malice or violence reigns, then none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country. By far, our greatest days lie ahead. Thank you very much.  And now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much."
"Thank you, General, and hello cadets. On behalf of our entire nation, let me say congratulations to the incredible West Point Class of 2020. Congratulations. Everyone have a good time, enjoy yourselves, because we are here to celebrate your achievements, and great achievements they are. Let us also recognize your remarkable Superintendent, General Darryl Williams, for his outstanding stewardship. General, thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Few words in the English language and few places in history have commanded as much awe and admiration as West Point. This premier military academy produces only the best of the best, the strongest of the strong, and the bravest of the brave. West Point is a universal symbol of American gallantry, loyalty, devotion, discipline, and great skill. There is no place on Earth I would rather be than right here with all of you. It’s a great honor. Across this hallowed plain have passed many of the greatest and most fearsome soldiers that ever lived. They were heroes who drove thundering columns of Sherman tanks into the heart of a wicked empire. They were legends who unleashed the fury of American artillery upon our enemies on remote islands and distant shores. They were titans who strode through cannon blast and cavalry charge, and stared down our foes through gray clouds of smoke and shrapnel. They were the Army Rangers who led the way up jagged cliffs, the Airborne soldiers who rained down justice in the dark of night, the infantry whose very sight meant liberation was near, and the mighty forces who sent tyrants, terrorists, and sadistic monsters running scared through the gates of hell. No evil force on Earth can match the noble power and righteous glory of the American warrior. I have no doubt that the young men and women before me today will add your names to this eternal chronicle of American heroes. You will go forth from this place adored by your countrymen, dreaded by your enemies, and respected by all throughout the world. Someday, generations of future West Point cadets will study your legacy. They will know your deeds, they will celebrate your triumphs, and they will proudly follow your example. To the 1,107 who today become the newest officers in the most exceptional Army ever to take the field of battle, I am here to offer America’s salute. Thank you for answering your nation’s call. On this special occasion, we are delighted to be joined by Congressman Steve Womack, Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy, Assistant Secretary Casey Wardynski, and Army Chief of Staff General James McConville, an old grad from the class of 1981. Let’s also express our appreciation to General Curtis Buzzard, General Cindy Jebb, and all of the wonderful instructors, coaches, and faculty members who are continuing West Point’s two-century tradition of unrivaled excellence. To all of the parents, grandparents, and family members watching this ceremony from your beautiful home: Even though you could not be here today, we know this day could never have happened without you. Your love and sacrifice have given America these phenomenal men and women. Cadets, please join me in sending your parents and families the heartfelt thanks that they so richly deserved. They’re all watching right now. Please. Thank you very much. The depth and breadth of the U.S. Military’s contributions to our society are an everlasting inspiration to us all. I want to take this opportunity to thank all members of America’s Armed Forces in every branch — active duty, National Guard, and reserve — who stepped forward to help battle the invisible enemy — the new virus that came to our shores from a distant land called China. We will vanquish the virus. We will extinguish this plague. I also want to thank the men and women of our National Guard who respond with precision to so many recent challenges, from hurricanes and natural disasters, to ensuring peace, safety, and the constitutional rule of law on our streets. We thank every citizen who wears a uniform in selfless service to our nation. The members of this class have come from every state in our union. You have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small, and from every race, religion, color, and creed. But when you entered these grounds, you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation. You became brothers and sisters pledging allegiance to the same timeless principles, joined together in a common mission to protect our country, to defend our people, and to carry on the traditions of freedom, equality, and liberty that so many gave their lives to secure. You exemplify the power of shared national purpose to transcend all differences and achieve true unity. Today, you graduate as one class, and you embody one noble creed: Duty, Honor, Country. Every graduate on this field could have gone to virtually any top-ranked university that you wanted. You chose to devote your life to the defense of America. You came to West Point because you know the truth: America is the greatest country in human history, and the United States Military is the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. The survival of America and the endurance of civilization itself depends on the men and women just like each of you. It depends on people who love their country with all their heart and energy and soul. It depends on citizens who build, sustain, nurture, and defend institutions like this one; that is how societies are made and how progress is advanced. What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment. When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring, and eternal. It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence. It was this school that gave us the men who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding. It was the graduates of West Point — towering figures like McArthur, Patton, Eisenhower, and Bradley — who led America to victory over the sinister Nazis and imperial fascists 75 years ago. It was under the leadership of West Point graduates like the legendary General Matthew Ridgway that the Army was at the forefront of ending the terrible injustice of segregation. It was Army strength that held the line against the brutal opposition and oppression from Communism. And it has been thanks to patriots like you that America has climbed to new heights of human achievement and national endeavor. This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits. It is the legacy purchased with American blood at the crest of Little Round Top, on the crimson beaches of Normandy, in the freezing mud of Bastogne, and the dense jungles of Vietnam. It is the legacy of courageous, selfless, faithful patriots who fought for every inch of dirt with every ounce of strength and every last scrap of heart and drive and grit they had. And they did it because they believed in the undying principles of our founding. They did it because they cherished their homes, their faith, their family, and their flag. And they did it because when they came to this school, they were taught to hold fast to their love of our country; to cherish our heritage, learn from it, and build upon it. That is what young Americans are taught here at West Point. That is the legacy that you carry forward as second lieutenants in the United States Army, and you must never forget it. Through four long years, you have honed your skills, trained your mind and body, overcome every obstacle, and earned your place of pride in the Long Gray Line. You made it through the rigors of R-Day and Beast, the intensity of CLDT, and weeks of training in the blistering heat. You have pushed yourselves far beyond every limit imaginable. Some of you have even pushed the limits a bit too much. So for any cadets who have not finished walking off their hours, as Commander-in-Chief, I hereby absolve all cadets on restriction for minor conduct offenses, and that is effective immediately. Congratulations.  That’s a nice one, isn’t it? Don’t you feel better now?  Surviving the 47-month experience is never easy, but only the class of 2020 can say it survived 48 months. And when it comes to bragging rights, no one can boast louder than the class that brought Navy’s 14-year football winning streak to a screeching halt. You did that. I happened to be there. I happened to be there. That’s right. That was a big day. I was there. You beat Navy and brought the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy back to West Point for two straight years. So we say, “Go, Army, go.” This graduating class secured more than 1,000 victories for the Black Knights, including three bowl victories, 13 NCAA team appearances, and a Women’s Rugby Championship with the help of somebody that I just met: 2019 MVP, Sam Sullivan. Fantastic job. Thank you. A fantastic job. Five cadets won national boxing championships, and Adaya Queen brought home two. Brendan Brown earned the title of Powerlifting National Champion. In academics, 38 cadets have earned fellowships to continue their studies, including First Captain Dane Van de Wall, who received one of the most prestigious awards in academia: the Rhodes Scholarship. Congratulations, Dane. It’s a great achievement. Thank you. Congratulations.  Great achievement. But no one modeled the values of the soldier-scholar quite like Lindy Mooradian. Lindy earned both the highest overall class standing and the highest physical program score. She has published scientific research in a prominent journal and set five new records on the athletic track. Lindy, incredible job. Where is Lindy? Where is Lindy? For somebody that did so well, they didn’t give you a very good seat, Lindy. We have to talk about that. Congratulations. Right now, America needs a class of cadets that lives by your motto: “With Vision, We Lead.” We need you to carry on the spirit of the great General Ulysses S. Grant. Soon after assuming overall command, following three years of Union setbacks, General Grant encountered someone heading north to Washington during the Battle of the Wilderness: “If you see the President,” Grant said, “tell him from me that whatever happens, there will  be no turning back.” We need you to be as visionary as Patton, who as a young man in 1917, became the first soldier assigned to the Army Tank Corps. One month into the job, he saw the future, writing, “If resistance is broken, and the line pierced, the tank must and will assume the role of pursuit cavalry and ride the enemy to death.” Under Patton’s leadership, that’s exactly what they did. We need you to be as bold and determined as the immortal General Douglas MacArthur, who knew that the American soldier never, ever quits. After leaving the Philippines for Australia at a low point of the Pacific War in 1942, MacArthur famously vowed, “I shall return.” For two years, he then took great strategic risks and placed himself often in personal danger. On October 20th, 1944, McArthur stepped off a landing boat, strode through knee-high water, and proclaimed, “People of the Philippines: I have returned. By the grace of Almighty God, our forces stand again on Philippine soil.” He then called upon the islands’ brave people to rise up and join the fight. America’s momentum was unstoppable. These great leaders were not afraid of what others might say about them. They didn’t care. They knew their duty was to protect their country. They knew the Army exists to preserve the republic and the strong foundations upon which it stands: family, God, country, liberty, and justice. They were true, tough American patriots. That is what our country needs, especially in these times, and that is what you are. Each of you begins your career in the Army at a crucial moment in American history. We are restoring the fundamental principles that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations, but defend — and defend strongly –our nation from foreign enemies. We are ending the era of endless wars. In its place is a renewed, clear-eyed focus on defending America’s vital interests. It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world. But let our enemies be on notice: If our people are threatened, we will never, ever hesitate to act. And when we fight, from now on, we will fight only to win. As MacArthur said: “In war, there is no substitute for victory.” To ensure you have the very best equipment and technology available, my administration has embarked on a colossal rebuilding of the American Armed Forces, a record like no other. After years of devastating budget cuts and a military that was totally depleted from these endless wars, we have invested over 2 trillion — trillion; that’s with a “T” — dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth. We are building new ships, bombers, jet fighters, and helicopters by the hundreds; new tanks, military satellites, rockets, and missiles; even a hypersonic missile that goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile currently available in the world and can hit a target 1,000 miles away within 14 inches from center point. For the first time in 70 years, we established a new branch of the United States military: the Space Force. It’s a big deal. In recent years, America’s warriors have made clear to all the high cost of threatening the American people. The savage ISIS caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed under the Trump administration, and its barbaric leader, al-Baghdadi, is gone, killed, over. And the world’s number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is likewise dead. As Commander-in-Chief, I never forget for one instant the immense sacrifices we ask of those who wear this nation’s uniform. Already, you have known the crushing pain of losing a brother in arms. Today, we remember an extraordinary cadet who made the supreme sacrifice in an accident last year: C.J. Morgan. We are deeply moved to be joined by his father, Christopher Morgan. And C.J. was something very special. Christopher is a Secret Service Agent. A tough guy. Great guy. Great son, who is looking down right now. Christopher, I want you to know that we will carry C.J.’s blessed memory in our hearts forever. Thank you very much. Thank you. Tomorrow, America will celebrate a very important anniversary: the 245th birthday of the United States Army. Unrelated, going to be my birthday also. I don’t know if that happened by accident. Did that happen by accident, please? But it’s a great day because of that Army birthday. And as you know, the Army’s first Commander-in-Chief, General George Washington, called the fort that stood on this majestic point “the most important post in America.” Its strategic location on the Hudson River was vital to our war for independence. If British ships gained control of this river, they would have divided our young nation in two. So American soldiers stretched a massive metal chain across the waters of the Hudson, from West Point all the way to Constitution Island. I saw a piece of that chain. It’s incredible. No enemy ship even dared try to cross. Every link in that great chain was formed from over 100 pounds of pure American iron, mined from American soil, and made with American pride. Together, those links formed an unbreakable line of defense. Standing here before you more than two centuries later, it is clearer than ever that General Washington’s words still hold true. West Point is still the indispensable post for America, the vital ground that must not lose. And the survival of our nation still depends on a great chain reaching out from this place — one made not of iron, but of flesh and blood, of memory and spirit, of sheer faith and unyielding courage. Today, each of you becomes another link in that unbroken chain, forged in the crucible known as the United States Military Academy, the greatest on Earth. It has given you soldiers that you can rely on to your right and to your left. And now we are entrusting you with the most noble task any warrior has ever had the privilege to carry out: the task of preserving American liberty. As long as you remain loyal, faithful, and true, then our enemies don’t even stand a chance, our rights will never be stolen, our freedoms will never be trampled, our destiny will never be denied, and the United States of America will never be defeated. With the grace of God and the heroes of West Point, America will always prevail. Nothing will stand in your way, nothing will slow you down, and nothing will stop the West Point Class of 2020 from achieving a true and lasting victory. God bless you. God bless the United States Army. And God bless America. Congratulations. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Wow. Are you having a good time? Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans: The First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America.  On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy Fourth of July to everyone.  I want to thank the U.S. Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display. Tremendous talent. The Golden Knights, and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. Two hundred and forty-four years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth: that we are all made equal by God.  Thanks to the courage of those patriots of July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the Earth. We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing.  Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the Moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars.  All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot. That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names are etched on our monuments and memorials, and in the pages of history, and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together, we will fight for the American Dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.  Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by the same countries. But there and then we got hit by the virus that came from China. And we’ve made a lot of progress; our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area, and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to put out the flame. We’ve made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries, as a gesture of goodwill. Likewise, testing — there were no tests for a new virus, but now we have tested over 40 million people. But by so doing, we show cases, 99 percent of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have — not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. And now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators, we have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country where heretofore it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China, where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China’s secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world — 189 countries — and China must be held fully accountable.  With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well, and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics. I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver life-saving treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation’s scientific brilliance. And we’ll likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year.  We’re grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the frontlines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please stand. Please. Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people.  Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest, God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first-generation American and tenth-generation American. This heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old — first-generation American — we want to go from first generation to tenth generation; it matters not. We are American. We are from the USA.  This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first. We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are, are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth, what we have built: The United States of America. To build a future, where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity, and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity. Our past is not a burden to be cast away, it is a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. The incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished — linked by time, by fate, and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. These are great heroes. Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That’s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and much more principled than you. You are slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression. They didn’t fight for those things; they fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth. And we will win. The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united. After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order. We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in a great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs and we want to be respected by the rest of the world; not taken advantage of by the rest of the world, which has gone on for decade after decade. We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things? The more bitter you become, the more we will appeal to love and patriotism, and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great country. To celebrate America’s majestic inheritance, yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brand-new monument to our most beloved icons. The National Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends. And why don’t we start with a man who has been very unfairly treated, who, two years ago, three years ago — especially five or six years ago — people would have said it’s impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success: George Washington. Thomas Jefferson. Betsy Ross. Alexander Hamilton. Benjamin Franklin. John Adams. James Madison. Dolly Madison. The great Frederick Douglass. Abraham Lincoln. Harriet Tubman. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Clara Barton. Daniel Boone. Davy Crockett. Henry Clay. Susan B. Anthony. Booker T. Washington. Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are looking down. And you’re going to see some planes like you have never seen before, because we build them better than anybody in the world. The greatest Air Force, the greatest fighters, the greatest everything. You’re going to be seeing something — I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that. But they’re looking. They’re checking it out right now along with us. Amelia Earhart.  A great, great athlete no matter where he went; he was the best athlete: Jackie Robinson. George S. Patton — General Patton. He didn’t know how to lose. He didn’t don’t how to lose. General Douglas MacArthur. Audie Murphy. The great Billy Graham. And an incredible man, respected by everybody: Martin Luther King. President Ronald Reagan. Christa McAuliffe, and Antonin Scalia.  So those are just a few of the people we’ll be naming, and things are subject to change, but once we make that decision, those great names are going to be up there and they’re never coming down. They have just been an incredible group. And we are going to do this in a very democratic way, frankly. We’re going to take names and suggestions. We’re going to have committees and we’re going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known. The most respected people. The people that helped us the most. And the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say, “Isn’t America just a tremendous place?” So, thank you. That will be very exciting. The patriots who built our country were not villains, they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the Earth beyond measure. The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division, and to continue the work of our Founding Fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our Constitution. It is our founding and our Constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved. That’s why our country is so strong, even despite terrible things that happen over the generations. Here this evening are a number of heroes who risk their own lives to uphold these values and keep our communities and our country safe. We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines, protecting our cities — many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man: Fallen Officer David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. And to David’s great family, I want to thank you very much. The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. And nobody — nobody — embodies that better than David. Thank you very much. Please. And David is looking down right now, and he is so proud of you and he loves you so much. And thank you for being here. He’s a great man. He’s a great man. Finally tonight, we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years. We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States Military.  Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world, and here at home, are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this Earth to secure liberty and peace. Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free. These are great, great people. These are great, great heroes, indeed. And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see. You know that. This will make our country even stronger long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea’s MiG Alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip- — and you know that sweeping — it was swift and it was sweeping like nobody has ever seen anything happen — a victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they have gone on to dangerous missions around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely. As you know, we’ve killed, this last year, the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years: al-Baghdadi and Soleimani. Killed. Gone. Over. We have worked to fully rebuild the Armed Forces of the United States. No enemy on Earth stands a chance — $2.5 trillion, we’ve invested — all made in the USA. We’ve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they’ve rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty. In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America’s daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried – but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence: We are Americans, and we never back down, we never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield [in] defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win. Today, we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of liberty. We honor the legends of our history, the glories of our Founding Fathers, and the giants of the past, and the heroes of today who keep us safe, who keep us strong and proud, and who keep us free. Once again, Happy July Fourth to all. Our country is in great shape. Our military has never been stronger. And many, many good things are going to happen. Next year will be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had. I want to thank our men and women — they are so good — of the National Park Service, Air Traffic Control, and the United States Military. God Bless you, God Bless our heroes, God bless America. And now, let the flyovers begin. Thank you very much."

We’re grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the frontlines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please stand. Please. Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people.  Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest, God-given potential. Never forget: We are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first-generation American and tenth-generation American. This heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old — first-generation American — we want to go from first generation to tenth generation; it matters not. We are American. We are from the USA.  This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first. We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are, are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on Earth, what we have built: The United States of America. To build a future, where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity, and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity. Our past is not a burden to be cast away, it is a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. The incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation picking up where the last finished — linked by time, by fate, and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. These are great heroes. Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That’s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and much more principled than you. You are slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression. They didn’t fight for those things; they fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth. And we will win. The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united. After all, what do we want? We want a strong military, great education, housing, low taxes, law and order. We want safety, we want equal justice, we want religious liberty, we want faith and family, and living in a great communities and happy communities and safe communities. And we want great jobs and we want to be respected by the rest of the world; not taken advantage of by the rest of the world, which has gone on for decade after decade. We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things? The more bitter you become, the more we will appeal to love and patriotism, and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great country. To celebrate America’s majestic inheritance, yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brand-new monument to our most beloved icons. The National Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends. And why don’t we start with a man who has been very unfairly treated, who, two years ago, three years ago — especially five or six years ago — people would have said it’s impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success: George Washington. Thomas Jefferson. Betsy Ross. Alexander Hamilton. Benjamin Franklin. John Adams. James Madison. Dolly Madison. The great Frederick Douglass. Abraham Lincoln. Harriet Tubman. Harriet Beecher Stowe. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Clara Barton. Daniel Boone. Davy Crockett. Henry Clay. Susan B. Anthony. Booker T. Washington. Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are looking down. And you’re going to see some planes like you have never seen before, because we build them better than anybody in the world. The greatest Air Force, the greatest fighters, the greatest everything. You’re going to be seeing something — I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that. But they’re looking. They’re checking it out right now along with us. Amelia Earhart.  A great, great athlete no matter where he went; he was the best athlete: Jackie Robinson. George S. Patton — General Patton. He didn’t know how to lose. He didn’t don’t how to lose. General Douglas MacArthur. Audie Murphy. The great Billy Graham. And an incredible man, respected by everybody: Martin Luther King. President Ronald Reagan. Christa McAuliffe, and Antonin Scalia.  So those are just a few of the people we’ll be naming, and things are subject to change, but once we make that decision, those great names are going to be up there and they’re never coming down. They have just been an incredible group. And we are going to do this in a very democratic way, frankly. We’re going to take names and suggestions. We’re going to have committees and we’re going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known. The most respected people. The people that helped us the most. And the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say, “Isn’t America just a tremendous place?” So, thank you. That will be very exciting. The patriots who built our country were not villains, they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the Earth beyond measure. The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division, and to continue the work of our Founding Fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our Constitution. It is our founding and our Constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved. That’s why our country is so strong, even despite terrible things that happen over the generations. Here this evening are a number of heroes who risk their own lives to uphold these values and keep our communities and our country safe. We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines, protecting our cities — many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man: Fallen Officer David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. And to David’s great family, I want to thank you very much. The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. And nobody — nobody — embodies that better than David. Thank you very much. Please. And David is looking down right now, and he is so proud of you and he loves you so much. And thank you for being here. He’s a great man. He’s a great man. Finally tonight, we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years. We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States Military.  Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world, and here at home, are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this Earth to secure liberty and peace. Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free. These are great, great people. These are great, great heroes, indeed. And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see. You know that. This will make our country even stronger long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea’s MiG Alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip- — and you know that sweeping — it was swift and it was sweeping like nobody has ever seen anything happen — a victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they have gone on to dangerous missions around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely. As you know, we’ve killed, this last year, the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years: al-Baghdadi and Soleimani. Killed. Gone. Over. We have worked to fully rebuild the Armed Forces of the United States. No enemy on Earth stands a chance — $2.5 trillion, we’ve invested — all made in the USA. We’ve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they’ve rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty. In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America’s daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried – but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence: We are Americans, and we never back down, we never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield [in] defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win. Today, we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of liberty. We honor the legends of our history, the glories of our Founding Fathers, and the giants of the past, and the heroes of today who keep us safe, who keep us strong and proud, and who keep us free. Once again, Happy July Fourth to all. Our country is in great shape. Our military has never been stronger. And many, many good things are going to happen. Next year will be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had. I want to thank our men and women — they are so good — of the National Park Service, Air Traffic Control, and the United States Military. God Bless you, God Bless our heroes, God bless America. And now, let the flyovers begin. Thank you very much."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Labor Day. That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They’re very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific. So we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they’re doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It’s why I thought we’d do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place. The United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we’re doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we’re rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic. The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, and we’ve have added a record-setting 10.6 million jobs since May. 10.6 million jobs since May. That’s a record that is not even close. Second place is a long ways away. In July, the Congressional Budget Office was projecting unemployment over 10.5 percent through the end of 2020. So they thought 2020, and maybe it would be a lot longer than that. Some projections, where you’d go through the entire year, and that includes a lot of months in the following year, 2021. And instead, the unemployment rate plunged, really, to the surprise of many, all the way down to 8.4 percent in August. And that’s the second-largest single month decline on record. And we have the first; we have both of them. So we have the two number-one declines—“decline” meaning positive, not negative. We’re currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history—world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small—very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery. Under my leadership, next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, I project. And some people are starting to agree. We have a “V” shape. It’s probably a “super V.” And you see what’s going on with the stock market, where it’s, in certain cases, already setting records. NASDA You’re going to have to take that off, please. Just—you can take it off. Your health—how many feet are you away?  Well, if you don’t take it off, you’re very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.  It’s better, yeah. It’s better.  No, I don’t understand that.  No, I don’t understand it at all, no, because I’ve always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we’re going to win them. And, frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that’s been very obvious. I was—but I had to approve his entire—his funeral. I wanted him to get—he deserved a first-class—you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket—a lot of things. But, no, I was never a fan of John McCain because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn’t. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of—our great vets—was not good, not appropriate. And, of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody—am I supposed to say, “What a wonderful guy”? So, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it’s turned out to be right. But I wasn’t a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn’t mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn’t agree with him on a lot of things. The story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself—which I don’t read, but I hear it’s just totally anti-Trump; he’s a big Obama person, he’s a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It’s a totally made-up story. In fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he’s—that’s—I think that’s number 15—and these are people that were there. That’s the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it’s not true. He just came out. And it’s a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There’s nobody—and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me. But Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn’t hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue. Now, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I’ve just about ever seen. And it was a fog you—you literally couldn’t see. I walked out, and I didn’t have—I didn’t need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, “There’s no way we can take helicopters in this.” I understand helicopters very well. And they said, “No, sir, that’s been cancelled.” They would have had to go—Secret Service, I have the whole list—they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, “Please don’t do it,” because they’re not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that. I wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for two hours, three hours, four hours. I didn’t care. It didn’t matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, “Sir, we can’t allow you to make this trip.” If I wanted to: “Sir, we can’t allow you, from a safety standpoint.” It was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier—the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there’ll be more phony stories. But I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that’s denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he’s probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that’s enough of that. Yes, please.  Thank you.  We’re talking about where? Non-lethal force?  The riots?  Well, I think what’s happened is the—the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there’s no—there’s no retribution. There’s no—they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen. But I’ve told, when we have the federal in there—as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a—another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After two and a half days, they didn’t arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren’t playing games. They can’t play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there’s got to be a form of retribution. I watch—so often, when I watch some of the areas that we’re talking about—now we have Rochester—that’s, again, Democrat governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be. I was with the governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, “I can’t imagine how they allow this to happen.” And, you know, it’s different. It’s different. I could talk about other governors saying the same thing. Yeah, please, go ahead.  Yeah.  Yeah. Q—from the Department of Justice for those traveling for that purpose?  So we have now over 1,000 people—federal—in jail. We’re prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was three months ago. There hasn’t been a federal monument knocked down in three months, or even thought about. I don’t think they’ve even thought about it. So that’s had a very big impact—a very big impact. But, yeah, we’re going around, and the nice part is you people take—see those people up there?—they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don’t even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it. But right after that, I signed a—an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They’ve—they’ve got plenty of ideas. They’re not at want for ideas. Please, go ahead.  I don’t think they are. Q—doing a lot of golfing. Why have you not met with them in person?  Yeah.  I know. I know.  Don’t say there’s “no hope.” Why do you say there’s “no hope”?  What do you know?  What do you know?  And let me just tell you: I know my customers; that’s what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don’t want to make a deal because they think it’s good for politics if they don’t make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you’re dealing with. I do. These are people that I don’t have a lot of respect. I don’t think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I’m dealing with. And I don’t need to meet with them to be turned down. They don’t want to make a deal because they know that’s good for the economy. And if they make a deal that’s good for the economy, and therefore it’s good for me for the election in November—November 3rd, and therefore they’re not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want—they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and states. Whether it’s New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we’re saying, “Well, we’re not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out.” We’ll do something to help cities, but that’s going to have to rest on its own. And why didn’t you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I’m dealing with. And I’m on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they’re there. But I also know when it’s time to meet with people. I’ve done very well with deals, okay? That’s what I do. And I know when it’s time to meet. But I don’t have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks—which is the microphones—and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office. So they don’t want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that’s good for the Democrats. But, David, that’s a bad thing. Yeah, please. Go ahead.  I am taking the high road. I’m taking the high road by not seeing them. That’s the high road. Yeah.  And if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I’d do it in a minute. Yeah. Go ahead.  Yeah. Sure. Sure.  They spied on my campaign. That’s right.  They spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail two years ago. They would have been in jail—literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail two years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.  I’m not going to say that. I have to see the report. I haven’t seen—I purposely—I don’t know if that was a good thing, smart thing. I don’t know. But nobody can complain about it. I have every right to have been very much involved, and maybe someday I’ll get involved in it. They spied on my campaign, and that includes Biden and Obama. They spied on my campaign trying to defeat me. They wrote up a fake dossier that has proven to be totally fake—written by Christopher Steele, paid for by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats—and they used that illegally in the FISA courts. If we did what they did, you would have many people in jail all right—right now. And you have, other than the one agent that admitted his guilt that he forged documents—we don’t have that yet, but the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens.  But let me just—let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let’s see what happens. But if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least—it would have started two years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can’t do that. That’s never—and nothing like that’s ever happened before. Then they created, at tremendous expense—the money they paid is tremendous; I’m sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier—a fake dossier—proven to be, now, fake. Everyone—and they used it in the FISA courts. That’s a crime.  So far, I haven’t seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn’t been issued yet. Let’s see what happens with the Durham report. But this started at Obama, and some people would say—and some people, “Well, but he was President,” like, “Let’s leave him alone.” If it were me, they wouldn’t be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It’s a totally double standard, and it’s a—it’s a disgrace. And if I were a Republican senator and if I were a Republican congressman—and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don’t fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot—they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they’re dirty fighters. And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They’re not requested; they’re just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them “unsolicited ballots.” That’s going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they’re going to say, “What am I doing?” And then they’re going to harvest. They’re going to do all the things. And if you look at the last period of six months—take a look at the races where they’ve sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what’s happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It’s a disgrace. That’ll be a beauty. Yeah, please.  Yeah, I don’t know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don’t—other than that, I’d have to see it. He’s a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of a—an approval that took place by both parties. I don’t know exactly what the story is. I’ll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time—I read it this morning, just like you did.  Sure. Sure.  I think let the investigations go. But—but he’s a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster general is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we’ll see how that goes. But, no, I think he’s a very honest guy, but we’ll see. Yeah.  Go ahead, please.  Yeah. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?  Always. They’ve been looking at me for four years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For four years—from the day I came down the escalator, I’ve been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, “You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the Office of President.” Think of it: They spent—just Mueller alone, he spent—I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was—many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every—and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said—sophisticated friends have said, “You’ve got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.” And there’s a lot of truth to that. Yeah, please.  Sure.  Sure. Well, I’ve been support-—I’ve been supportive of that. I was the first one that brought it up. You never heard of Nord Stream 2 until Trump came along. When I came along, I said, “Wait a minute. We’re protecting Germany from Russia, right?” NATO. “We’re protecting Germany from Russia. Germany is paying Russia billions and billions of dollars to get their energy.” And the real number is probably 60 to 70 percent, ultimately, of their energy is going to come from Russia. And I said this for years, that nobody talks about it. One of the many things, between sanctions and all of the—what we’ve done for Ukraine, relative to what the past—they used to send pillows, and we sent tank busters. But I brought that up a long time ago. Russia is unhappy that I brought it up. But you never heard of Nord Stream 2; nobody did, until I got elected. And I said, “Why is Germany making a deal to give billions of dollars to Russia, and then we’re protecting Germany from Russia? How does that work?” And then, on top of it, Germany is delinquent because they’re only paying a little more than 1 percent and they’re supposed to be paying 2 percent, and even the 2 percent is low. But just remember: Trump—me—I got the countries of NATO to spend one point—$130 billion, going to $400 billion a year. Think of it: $400 billion a year more for NATO. And the purpose of NATO primarily is Europe protection against Russia. Now, they can use it for other, I guess—and they have a little bit in the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera. But I’m the one that did that. So—but nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about Nord Stream 2. The answer is: Absolutely, if they feel that something happens. But I don’t know that Germany is in a position right now, because Germany is in a very weakened position, energy wise. They’re closing all their plants. They’re closing their nuclear. They’re closing their coal. They’re closing a lot of plants. And they are—they have put themselves in a very bad position, frankly. Very, very bad position. Yeah, please.  No, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No. I was very heartened to see that a friend of his—because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him—I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did—I guess, late last night—that it was not true.  Well, we’re going to do a report. Yeah, I fired those people; they’re all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we’re going to give you a big report that’s going to make you very happy. All right, yeah, please.  No, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They’re going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it—and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson & Johnson, I spoke to the head of the greatest medical companies in the world. We’re doing great. We’re going to have it soon.  Wait a minute. So now what they’re saying is, “Oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.” By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn’t have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn’t have it all. So we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I’m talking about.  But let me just tell you—wait. And what they’re doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources—if you have sources—if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you’ll see it’s going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good. So now they’re saying, “Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let’s disparage the vaccine.” That’s so bad for this country. That’s so bad for the world to even say that. And that’s what they’re saying. But I watched Kamala’s poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero, and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn’t like her, and I understand why. She will never be President—although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.  But you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you’re going to have to look at her a little bit too closely. But she’s talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don’t think the achievement was a great achievement. I don’t want the achievement for myself, I want something that’s going to make people better, that people aren’t going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we’re doing equally as well. Therapeutics.  Go ahead.  Yes.  No, I didn’t say—I didn’t say “they will.” I said, “By the end of the year.”  No, but you’re not quoting me accurately. Q—say they’re guilty of?  I said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market—they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else. You know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we’re going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon. So I didn’t say what you said. What I said is “by the end of the year.” But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.  No, I’m saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast—with me, it’s: The faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I’m saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have—if get the vaccine early, that’s a great thing, whether it’s politics or not. Now, do benefits inure if you’re able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it’s the most important thing. Yeah, go ahead. In the back.  You sound so clear as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.  Yeah. Q—why do you object to that being taught in schools? And do you object to slavery itself being taught in schools?  Yeah, so—no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I’m not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don’t study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately. But we grew up with a certain history, and now they’re trying to change our history—revisionist history. That’s why they want to take down our monuments. That’s why they want to take down our statues. I saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it—the D.C. committee, but the D.C. committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson—I mean, we’re talking about—this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to re-designate it. They want to take some down. No, we don’t do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that. Well, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we’re having tremendous success, whether it’s on the vaccines, whether it’s on the pandemic—the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen because I will never feel the same about China. And I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day. Thank you very much, everybody."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I stand before you today to fulfill one of my highest and most important duties under the United States Constitution: the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice. This is my third such nomination after Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. And it is a very proud moment indeed. Over the past week, our nation has mourned the loss of a true American legend. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a legal giant and a pioneer for women. Her extraordinary life and legacy will inspire Americans for generations to come. Now we gather in the Rose Garden to continue our never-ending task of ensuring equal justice and preserving the impartial rule of law. Today, it is my honor to nominate one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution: Judge Amy Coney Barrett.  We’re also joined by Amy’s husband, Jesse—thank you, Jesse, very much—and their seven beautiful children. Congratulations to you all. A very special day. With us as well are the First Lady—thank you, First Lady, along with Vice President Mike Pence and his amazing wife, Karen. Thank you very much, Mike.  Judge Barrett is a graduate of Rhodes College and the University of Notre Dame Law School. At Notre Dame, she earned a full academic scholarship, served as the Executive Editor of the Law Review, graduated first in her class, and received the law school’s award for the best record of scholarship and achievement. Upon graduation, she became a clerk for Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Amy then received one of the highest honors a young lawyer could have, serving as a clerk on the Supreme Court for Justice Antonin Scalia. A highly, a very highly respected law professor at Notre Dame wrote to Justice Scalia with a one-sentence recommendation: “Amy Coney is the best student I ever had.” That’s pretty good. Justice Scalia hired her shortly thereafter. And we are honored to have his wonderful wife, Maureen—where is Maureen? Maureen Scalia—with us today.   Thank you. And our great Secretary of Labor, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Very good genes in that family, I will say. Very good genes. Before joining the bench, Judge Barrett spent 15 years as a Professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. She was renowned for her scholarship, celebrated by her colleagues, and beloved by her students. Three times, she was selected at Notre Dame, Distinguished Professor of the Year. When I nominated Judge Barrett to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in 2017, every law clerk from her time at the Supreme Court endorsed her and endorsed her nomination, writing, quote, “We are Democrats, Republicans, and independents…yet we write to support the nomination of Professor Barrett to be a Circuit Judge…Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is eminently qualified for the job.” And I can tell you, I did that too. I looked and I studied, and you are very eminently qualified for this job. You are going to be fantastic. Thank you. Really fantastic. The entire Notre Dame Law facility and faculty, everybody—everybody at that school also—we got so many letters—also wrote letters of support of Amy’s nomination to the Seventh Circuit. They wrote, in effect: “Despite our differences, we unanimously agree that our constitutional system depends upon an independent judiciary staffed by talented people devoted to the fair and impartial administration of the rule of law. And we unanimously agree that Amy is such a person.” For the last three years, Judge Barrett has served with immense distinction on the federal bench. Amy is more than a stellar scholar and judge; she is also a profoundly devoted mother. Her family is a core part of who Amy is. She opened her home and her heart, and adopted two beautiful children from Haiti. Her incredible bond with her youngest child, a son with Down Syndrome, is a true inspiration. If confirmed, Justice Barrett will make history as the first mother of school-aged children ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. That’s good.  To her children Emma, Vivian, Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and Benjamin, thank you for sharing your incredible mom with our country. Thank you very much.  Amy Coney Barrett will decide cases based on the text of the Constitution as written. As Amy has said, “Being a judge takes courage. You are not there to decide cases as you may prefer. You are there to do your duty and to follow the law wherever it may take you.” That is exactly what Judge Barrett will do on the U.S. Supreme Court. I want to thank the members of the Senate. We have so many of them here today. Thank you very much. I see you in the audience, and you’re so proud. But I want to thank you for your commitment and to providing a fair and timely hearing. I know it will be that. Judge Barrett was confirmed to the Circuit Court three years ago by a bipartisan vote. Her qualifications are unsurpassed—unsurpassed—and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation. It should be very easy. Good luck. It’s going to be very quick. I’m sure it’ll be extremely non-controversial. We said that the last time, didn’t we? Well, thank you all very much, and thank you for being here. That’s really great. Thank you.  I further urge all members of the other side of the aisle to provide Judge Barrett with the respectful and dignified hearing that she deserves and, frankly, that our country deserves. I urge lawmakers and members of the media to refrain from personal or partisan attacks. And the stakes for our country are incredibly high. Rulings that the Supreme Court will issue in the coming years will decide the survival of our Second Amendment, our religious liberty, our public safety, and so much more. To maintain security, liberty, and prosperity, we must preserve our priceless heritage of a nation of laws, and there is no one better to do that than Amy Coney Barrett. Law and order is the foundation of the American system of justice. No matter the issue, no matter the case before her, I am supremely confident that Judge Barrett will issue rulings based solely upon a fair reading of the law. She will defend the sacred principle of equal justice for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Congratulations again to Judge Barrett. I know that you will make our country very, very proud. Please, Amy, say a few words. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Congratulations.   Come on up, family. Come on up, family. I want to acknowledge Attorney General Bill Barr. Bill, thank you very much for being here. Chief of Staff—thank you very much, Chief. You’re doing a great job. And all of the senators—please, we really appreciate it. And I know you’re going to have a busy couple of weeks, but I think it’s going to be easier than you might think. So, thank you very much for being here. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Congratulations, Amy."

"Good evening. I’d like to provide the American people with an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us. If you count the votes that came in late — we’re looking at them very strongly. But a lot of votes came in late. I’ve already decisively won many critical states, including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, to name just a few. We won these and many other victories despite historic election interference from big media, big money, and big tech. As everybody saw, we won by historic numbers. And the pollsters got it knowingly wrong. They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave. And it’s been properly acknowledged, actually, by the media. They were, I think, very impressed, but that was after the fact. That doesn’t do us any good. We kept the Senate, despite having twice as many seats to defend as Democrats. And in a really — much more competitive states, we’ve — we did a fantastic job with the Senate, and I think we’re very proud of what’s happened there. We had many more seats to defend. They spent almost $200 million on Senate races in South Carolina and Kentucky alone — two races — and hundreds of millions of dollars overall against us. At the national level, our opponents’ major donors were Wall Street bankers and special interests. Our major donors were police officers, farmers, everyday citizens. Yet for the first time ever, we lost zero races in the House. I was talking to Kevin McCarthy today. He said he couldn’t believe it: zero races. Very unusual thing. Zero. And actually won many new seats with, I think, many more on the way. This was also the year of the Republican woman. More Republican women were elected to Congress than ever before. That’s a great achievement. I won the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican in 60 years, including historic numbers of Latino, African American, Asian American, and Native American voters — the largest ever in our history. We grew our party by 4 million voters, the greatest turnout in Republican Party history. Democrats are the party of the big donors, the big media, the big tech, it seems. And Republicans have become the party of the American worker, and that’s what’s happened. And we’re also, I believe, the party of inclusion. As everyone now recognizes, media polling was election interference, in the truest sense of that word, by powerful special interests. These really phony polls — I have to call them phony polls, fake polls — were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans’ ability to raise funds. They were what’s called “suppression polls.” Everyone knows that now. And it’s never been used to the extent that it’s been used on this last election. To highlight just a few examples: The day before election, Quinnipiac — which was wrong on every occasion that I know of — had Joe Biden up by 5 points in Florida, and they were off by 8.4 points. And I won Florida easily. Easily. So, they had me losing Florida by a lot, and I ended up winning Florida by a lot. Other than that, they were very accurate. They had him up 4 points in Ohio, and they were off by 12.2 points. And I also won Ohio — the great state of Ohio — very easily. The Washington Post had Biden up 17 points in Wisconsin, and it was basically even. They were off by about 17 points, and they knew that. They’re not stupid people. They knew that. Suppression. There are now only a few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus of those states are run, in all cases, by Democrats. We were winning in all the key locations by a lot, actually. And then our number started miraculously getting whittled away in secret, and they wouldn’t allow legally permissible observers. We went to court, in a couple of instances, and we were able to get the observers put in. And when the observers got there, they wanted them 60, 70 feet away, 80 feet, 100 feet away — or outside the building to observe people inside the building. And we won a case — a big case. And we have others happening. There are a lot of — lots of litigation. Even beyond our litigation, there’s tremendous amount of litigation generally because of how unfair this process was, and I predicted that. I’ve been talking about mail-in voting for a long time. It’s — it’s really destroyed our system. It’s a corrupt system. And it makes people corrupt even if they aren’t by nature, but they become corrupt; it’s too easy. They want to find out how many votes they need, and then they seem to be able to find them. They wait and wait, and then they find them. And you see that on Election Night. We were ahead in votes in North Carolina by a lot — tremendous number of votes. And we’re still ahead by a lot, but not as many because they’re finding ballots all of a sudden. “Oh, we have some mail-in ballots.” It’s amazing how those mail-in ballots are so one-sided, too. I know that it’s supposed to be to the advantage of the Democrats, but in all cases, they’re so one-sided. We were up by nearly 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. I won Pennsylvania by a lot, and that gets whittled down to — I think they said now we’re up by 90,000 votes. And they’ll keep coming and coming and coming. They find them all over. And they don’t want us to have any observers, although we won a court case. The judge said you have to have observers. Likewise, in Geor- — and they’re appealing. Actually, they’re appealing. We won a case that we want people to watch and we want observers, and they’re actually appealing, which is sort of interesting. I wonder why they’d appeal — that all we want to do is have people watch as they do the vote tabulations. Likewise, in Georgia, I won by a lot — a lot — with a lead of over — getting close to 300,000 votes on Election Night in Georgia. And, by the way, got whittled down, and now it’s getting to be to a point where I’ll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being even down a little bit. In Georgia, a pipe burst in a faraway location, totally unrelated to the location of what was happening, and they stopped counting for four hours, and a lot of things happened. The election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats. We also had margins of 300,000 in Michigan. We were way up in Michigan; won the state. And in Wisconsin, we did likewise fantastically well. And that got whittled down. Every — in every case, they got whittled down. Today, we’re on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote — 55 percent margins. And that’s a margin that we’ve significantly exceeded. So we’ll see what happens with that, but we’re on track to do okay in Arizona. Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We’ll not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or any election, for that matter. And we can’t allow silence –anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results. I’ve never had — I’ve been doing a lot of public things for a long time; I’ve never had anything that’s been as inspirational by people — calling, talking, sending things to us. I’ve never seen such — such love and such affection and such spirit as I’ve seen for this. People know what’s happening, and they see what’s happening, and it’s before their eyes. And there are many instances which will be reported very shortly. There’s tremendous litigation going on. And this is a case where they’re trying to steal an election, they’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen. Detroit and Philadelphia — known as two of the most corrupt political places anywhere in our country, easily — cannot be responsible for engineering the outcome of a presidential race — a very important presidential race. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have gone to the State Supreme Court to try and ban our election observers, and very strongly. Now, we won the case, but they’re — they’re going forward. They don’t want anybody in there. They don’t want anybody watching them as they count the ballots, and I can’t imagine why. There’s absolutely no legitimate reason why they would not want to have people watching this process, because if it’s straight, they would be — they should be proud of it. Instead, they’re trying, obviously, to commit fraud. There’s no question about that. In Philadelphia, observers have been kept far away — very far away — so far that people are using binoculars to try and see, and there’s been tremendous problems caused. They put paper on all of the windows so you can’t see in, and the people that are banned are very unhappy and become somewhat violent. The 11th Circuit ruled that, in Georgia, the votes have been in by Election Day — that they should be in by Election Day, and they weren’t. Votes are coming in after Election Day. And they had a ruling already that you have to have the votes in by Election Day. To the best of my knowledge, votes should be in by Election Day, and they didn’t do that. Democrat officials never believed they could win this election honestly. I really believe that. That’s why they did the mail-in ballots, where there’s tremendous corruption and fraud going on. That’s why they mailed out tens of millions of unsolicited ballots without any verification measures whatsoever. And I’ve told everybody that these things would happen, because I’ve seen it happen. I watched a lot of different elections before they decided to go with this big, massive election with tens of millions of ballots going out to everybody — in many cases, totally unsolicited. This was unprecedented in American history. This was by design. Despite years of claiming to care about the election security, they refuse to include any requirement to verify signatures, identities, or even determine whether they’re eligible or ineligible to vote. People are walking in that they have no idea; they’re just taking numbers. They’re writing down things — the workers — and doing a lot of bad things. And we have a lot of information coming and litigation that you’ll see that will shake even you people up, and you’ve seen it all. The officials overseeing the counting in Pennsylvania and other key states are all part of a corrupt Democrat machine that you’ve written about — and, for a long time, you’ve been writing about the corrupt Democrat machine. I went to school there, and I know a lot about it. It hasn’t changed. It’s a long time ago, and it hasn’t changed. It’s gotten worse. In Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election, and we think much more than that. And they are counting those without even postmarks or any identification whatsoever. So you don’t have postmarks; you don’t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place. So you don’t have postmarks; you don’t have identification. There have been a number of disturbing irregularities across the nation. Our campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit. Detroit is another place — and I wouldn’t say has the best reputation for election integrity. Poll workers in Michigan were duplicating ballots. But when our observers attempted to challenge the activity, those poll workers jumped in front of the volunteers to block their view so that they couldn’t see what they were doing, and it became a little bit dangerous. One major hub for counting ballots in Detroit covered up the windows, again, with large pieces of cardboard. And so they wanted to protect and block the counting area. They didn’t want anybody seeing the counting, even though these were observers who are legal observers that were supposed to be there. In Detroit, there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting. The final batch did not arrive until four in the morning and — even though the polls closed at eight o’clock. So they brought it in, and the batches came in, and nobody knew where they came from. We’ve also been denied access to observe in critical places in Georgia. In multiple swing states, counting was halted for hours and hours on Election Night, with results withheld from major Democrat-run locations, only to appear later. And they certainly appeared, and they all had the name “Biden” on them, or just about all — I think almost all. They all had the name “Biden” on them, which is a little strange. I challenge Joe and every Democrat to clarify that they only want legal votes. Because they talk about votes, and I think they should use the word “legal” — “legal votes.” “We want every legal vote counted.” And I want every legal vote counted. We want openness and transparency — no secret count rooms, no mystery ballots, no illegal votes being cast after Election Day. You have Election Day, and the laws are very strong on that. You have an Election Day. And they don’t want votes cast after Election Day, and they want the process to be an honest one. It’s so important. We want an honest election, and we want an honest count, and we want honest people working back there because it’s a very important job. So that’s the way this country is going to win. That’s the way the United States will win. And we think we will win the election very easily. We think there’s going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence, so much proof. And it’s going to end up, perhaps, at the highest court in the land. We’ll see. But we think there’ll be a lot of litigation because we can’t have an election stolen by — like this. And I — I tell you, I would — I have been talking about this for many months with all of you. And I’ve said very strongly that mail-in ballots are going to end up being a disaster. Small elections were a disaster. Small, very easy-to-handle elections were disastrous. This is a large-scale version, and it’s getting worse and worse every day. We’re hearing stories that are horror stories — absolute horror stories. And we can’t let that happen to the United States of America. It’s not a question of who wins — Republican, Democrat; Joe, myself. We can’t let that happen to our country. We can’t be disgraced by having something like this happen. So it will be hopefully cleared up, maybe soon; I hope soon. But it’ll probably go through a process — a legal process. And, as you know, I’ve claimed certain states and he’s claiming states. So we can both claim the states, but ultimately I have a feeling judges are going to have to rule. But there’s been a lot of shenanigans, and we can’t stand for that in our country. Thank you very much."
"I know your pain. I know your hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt. It is a very tough period of time. There has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You are very special. You've see what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home...."
"I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. I immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building and expel the intruders.  America is, and must always be, a nation of law and order. The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy.  To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country.  And to those who broke the law, you will pay.  We have just been through an intense election, and emotions are high, but now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored. We must get on with the business of America.  My campaign vigorously pursued every legal avenue to contest the election results. My only goal was to ensure the integrity of the vote. In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy. I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and the eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections. Now Congress has certified the results. A new administration will be inaugurated on January 20. My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly, and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.  2020 has been a challenging time for our people. A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our citizens, isolated millions in their homes, damaged our economy, and claimed countless lives. Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on earth will require all of us working together. It will require a renewed emphasis on the civic values of patriotism, faith, charity, community, and family. We must revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together as one national family.  To the citizens of our country, serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime. And to all of my wonderful supporters, I know you are disappointed but I also want you to know that our incredible journey is only just beginning. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
"My fellow Americans,  I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have said, the incursion of the US capitol struck at the very heart of our republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum.  I want to be very clear. I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement, and upholding our nation's most sacred traditions and values.  Mob violence goes against everything I believe in, and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement. You are attacking it, and you are attacking our country. We cannot tolerate it.  Tragically, over the course of the past year, made so difficult because of covid-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop, whether you are on the right or on the left, a democrat or a republican, there is never a justification for violence. No excuses. No exceptions.  America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.  Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda, to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here in Washington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US secret service on the potential threats.  Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment right. But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no lawbreaking, and no vandalism of any kind. Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement.  I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington, DC, we are bringing in thousands of national guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident.  Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm, moderation, and grace. We will get through this challenge, just like we always do.  I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel, and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong, and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence to one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the rancor and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security, and upholding the rule of law.  Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, our communities, and our country. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
"My fellow Americans: Four years ago, we launched a great national effort to rebuild our country, to renew its spirit, and to restore the allegiance of this government to its citizens. In short, we embarked on a mission to make America great again — for all Americans. As I conclude my term as the 45th President of the United States, I stand before you truly proud of what we have achieved together. We did what we came here to do — and so much more. This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck — a very important word. I’d like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy. I also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House Staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America. I also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and state and local law enforcement all across our country. Most of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that’s what it is — a great privilege and a great honor. We must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation. All Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor, and forge our common destiny. Four years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our nation was boundless as long as we put America first. So I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back. Together with millions of hardworking patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about “America First” because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn’t about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole nation. With the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close. We passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris Climate Accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA — that’s Mexico and Canada — a deal that’s worked out very, very well. Also, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China; made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction. The whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn’t have worked out this way. We wouldn’t have some of the best numbers we’ve ever had. We also unlocked our energy resources and became the world’s number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another, with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time, and boosted the retirements and pensions of hardworking citizens all across our nation. 401(k)s are at a level they’ve never been at before. We’ve never seen numbers like we’ve seen, and that’s before the pandemic and after the pandemic. We rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: “Made in the USA.” To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest-ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow. When our nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn’t be done but we did it. They call it a “medical miracle,” and that’s what they’re calling it right now: a “medical miracle.” Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in nine months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all. When the virus took its brutal toll on the world’s economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in healthcare, stood up to big pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world. We passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, Right to Try, and landmark criminal justice reform. We confirmed three new justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written. For years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the nation’s borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before, and to enforce our laws and keep America safe. We proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall. We restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don’t lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us. And perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military — all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years. We revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world’s top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. As a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our North Star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities; it’s to our children, our citizens, and to our nation itself. As President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices because that’s what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you. We worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It’s incredible. Now, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world’s most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people. No nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America. The key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share. At the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It’s not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions. In America, we don’t insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don’t do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That’s not who we are. It will never be who we are. For nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space. As I think back on the past four years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed, and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me; they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn. For the past four years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for — and that is safe, strong, proud, and free. Now, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There’s never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day. As long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before. I go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come. Thank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America."
